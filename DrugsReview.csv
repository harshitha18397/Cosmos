3,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42304,7,I have been on the shot years and until a month ago never period or even spotting A month ago dark brown blood awful odor amp now I have had a full blown period for days Not sure what to think I have continued the shot all of these years only because of the absent monthly
4,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42303,12,Ive had four shots at this point I was on birth control pills for years due to excessive bleeding and extreme pain Never had a regular period and would have them for over a week with HEAVY bleedingim talking pad and tampon at the same time and it would still overflow The pills only made it worse Since the shot i have had no issues I have gained about pounds but that didnt happen until months in And i quit antidepressants so that could have been why i gained weight After months there is no bleeding and no cramps I almost forget what its like to have a period And to be thruthful my boyfriend cums inside me and has since ive been on the shot Ive had no pregnancy scare or issues at all Its super convenient and easy
5,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42302,4,I had a total of shots I got my first one before leaving the hospital after giving birth to my first and only child I chose it on reccomendation from a friend who loves it I stopped taking it September counting the months I was pregnant I had not had a period in years I finally went to the Doctor since we were taking about having another baby They did an ultrasound and said that the wall of my uterus was pretty thick but nothing was done about it About a week later it finally started May I started spotting then a regular to heavy flow Its is not Oct and I am still bleeding My OB told me the only thing she could do for my is a D and C which I seem to have to keep rescheduling Dont take the shot
7,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42299,6,Im and got this for heavy bleeding Ive always heard that bc makes you gain weight but was NOT expecting what I go I gained lbs from just one shot Sent from my usual to Made me nauseated after I ate anything Had to buy a whole new wardrobe because I couldnt fit anything And my sex drive Omg I felt like a yr old women because I was as dry as a desert and couldnt get wet no matter what It was awful I really really dont suggest this I would much rather have cramps that make me throw up rather than take this shot ever again
8,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42298,2,Im and have been having heavy and painful periods since forever I got my depo shot last month and I spotted yesterday at school I was with my boyfriend but glad i took a good shower that he didnt noticei hope But same thing happened today morning too All thats happening is my head is hurting alittle but it started of brownish to a proper red I really hope its not for long But in terms of weight gain i have been eating alotttt more and my mood is a bit harder to control I wont take the shot anymore ill go for the pill but I would recommend dealing with the cramps and flow unless the doctor says something
9,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42298,5,Im a year old woman I got the shot on August th I have been bleeding since I decided not to continue Yes its effective at making sure you dont get pregnant because you cant have sex Its a double edged sword My face has broken out and I have a very good eating regime and my weight is up and down mostly up
10,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42297,2,Im years old and I got shot in August personally I dont mind it I mean I bleed little bits and random times but Id rather have the blood thats supposed to come out come out and not worry about where its going or staying in my body I have my other injection in November on the nd and Im still wondering if I could take it again The only downside to the injection is that I gained access weight and Im kind of moody
12,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42295,7,First month was awesome Absolutely wonderful Then I started lightly bleeding I just thought it was my period But it has lasted up until now which has been about almost months I will not take the shot again Having your period for months is hard on a girl And on top of that my emotions have been insane Like I am not a cryer I never cry and ever since Ive had the shot watching finding nemo makes me ball And I get pissed at people for nothing Its ridiculous Like I dislike who I have become with the shot
14,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42294,7,I started the Depo shot a year ago Originally I bled for weeks with a few days off After my second shot I bled for weeks and had weeks off of my period Then once my period started up again it never stopped So Ive been bleeding since the end of January which makes almost months that Ive been bleedingspotting with not even one day off There were times when it stopped for a few hours but I guess if it came right back it never actually stopped I didnt gain weight Ive struggled with mild depression anxiety poor appetite fatigue lots of nausea and abdominal pain My last shot was at the end of March Im getting the pill tomorrow to help regulate my hormones Im afraid of all birth control now but I hope this works
16,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42292,8,Im and I went on depo for very heavy bleeding Like so heavy I would go through a super plus tampon and over night pad in less then a hour I had the first shot about a month ago and it was fine a little pain but all shots do and now a month later a got my period much lighter for days which is very long for me then there was a day break and now it started again so in total I have been on my period for days I cant even go to school because the bleeding is very unpredictable its heavy one minute and lighter the next there is also large palm size Clots never had those before and the cramps sent me to the ER thinking I was having an appendix attack I never had cramps this bad before Dont know whats going on but I am not happy
18,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42291,4,I had my st shot on Sept nd I have had nonstop bleeding since Other side effects include extreme fatigue chills headache menstrual cramps almost daily depression and painful urination I want my life back I have made calls to my clinic and cant get past the front desk All I get told is there is nothing they will do about it until after Ive had my rd shot Pleaseif your considering this shot dont do it
22,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42287,5,I got the shot during my week post partum The nurse who I seen highly recommend the depo and said it would be great for me I spotted a few days here and there and finally got my period months later Ive been non stop bleeding super heavy for about days now The blood flow are clots the size of mini golf balls I feel so grouchy and tired Im supposed to go back in for my second shot this month HECK NO never again will I get this injection again Im in day of bleeding now Im constantly having to go to the restroom and change at work Ive been using overnight heavy flow pads since and its not getting any better
24,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42287,2,I had one injection in June after seeing a GP about wanting to try for a baby soon and he suggested I need to take Rubella immunisation and contraceptive He recommended Depo as he suggested it has minimum impact on my body before getting pregnant because its a progesterone only After the visit I found out on the net that the Depo shot can stop my ovulation for up to years I was a mess for a couple of month but after months I felt my cycle were coming back and after month before I even got a regular period back I fell pregnant Now we have a very healthy and happy year old It is effective as a contraceptive and Im now feel happy for what happened because I had a chronic anemia before but it got better while pregnant
25,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42332,2,I was on depo provera from the ages of Pros not pregnant no periods at all Cons I gained pounds I couldnt get lubricated for sex very easily My breasts lost sensitivity When coming off of depo provera in hopes to stop steadily gaining weight I had sexual dreams where I would actually orgasm and they were so painful I would wake up It felt like my uterus was being crushed and this pain would last anywhere from minutes to an hour When I told my doctor of this problem she looked at me like I was crazy The benefits do not make up for the horrible side effects I experienced Not recommended
28,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42331,17,I got this shot about and a half months ago I have not stopped bleeding spotting from the first day i got it not even for a day Im a surgeons first nurse so im on my feet all day and every now and again i get cramps along with it My Dr did tell me that the irregularities would be stopping after another dose or which mean i would have to wait about months to some see dry panties NO
29,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42330,26,I got the depo shot in the later part of September October I didnt have a period Comes November the th I had a brown discharge the second week it was my period and now I am still spotting days later I see why you have a quotdecreased sex drivequot you cant have sex Im definitely not getting my second shot Would I recommend this to anyone Ummmm NO
30,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometrial Hyperplasia Prophylaxis,9,42327,6,I had hyperplasia last year as well as endometriosis which I had surgery for First I was prescribed the prometrium pills Had great effects Stopped taking that and was irregular again Then I started bleeding and didnt stop for days and it was heavy We decided on the shot because I wanted added birth control I suffer from bipolar disorder and anything with estrogen is horrid days after the shot I stopped bleeding Some mild cramping a bit moody and weird dreams but overall great I think it works best if you are lacking progesterone
31,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42327,0,Im currently on the depo shot I had my baby in August and started the shot in Mid September Since then I have been bleeding non stop everyday Thats s lot of sanitary products to keep purchasing I also gained weight and it looks like Im pregnant again I was losing the pregnancy weight before taking the shot So far I gained lbs You have no sex lids because your constantly spotting and bleeding I WOULD NOT recommend this method
34,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42326,3,Will never ever ever ever get back on this Caused HORRIBLE depression terrible weight gain and basically got every side effect this drug can cause Wouldnt wish this drug on my worst friend AND it effects your fertility for up to a year which I wasnt told Good thing Im trying to have a baby now
35,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42326,0,You think that getting a shot is going to make your life easy yea right I am years old and had been on the pill for years due to my high blood pressure they put me on the shot go figure I got a shot on May I weighed lb mind you I am tall quot I had no real side effects come for the next shot I was a ten pound increase I dont eat junk food I got horrible headaches stomach cramps and horrible mood swings mostly anger Now here into Nov and I am and have pregant belly and no period since the May Do not do it
37,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42326,1,I got one dose of the Depo shot May Two months after getting the shot I had spotting here amp there Its November now amp for the past months Ive had spotting almost everyday painful sex no sex drive fatigue always hungry amp Ive gained weight like crazy I get irritated very easily amp get mood swings Lately Ive been bleeding heavily its annoying I have an appointment in months to see whats going on amp I was told the depo shot isnt suppose to stop your periods until nd or rd shot The only reason I got the depo was because my period was horrible it was heavy the whole time amp the cramps were unbearable I most definitely DONT recommend the Depo shot
38,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,42325,14,Ive been on depo for almost two years now and have not had a period since i got the injection i no longer have the debilitating cramps that i would get each month which is a godsend after im first given the shot i have about days of being a little more emotional than usual but its usually due to my hormones being balanced and changing a little but it just means a bit of crying and basically how i used to be emotionally before a period i have noticed that some nights i wake up with a really extreme cramp out of nowhere but i believe that that might be an issue thats more to due with my hormone levels etc either way depo has definitely spared me from weeks spent in bed because of the painful cramps
39,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42324,25,Hate it never getting another shot Ive had two and Im not getting my next one Im continuously spotting then bleeding and when I have sex theres no sex drive like I have to force myself to do it I hate it never again
41,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42323,6,I used the depo injection for years and loved it After years is when I experienced the side of effects My period went from days days to constant bleeding I didnt want any more kids so went through a procedure that took care of my issue Overall I was very happy with the injection
42,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42323,3,I was told by my provider this was a great option since Im horrible with taking pills I wanted to lose weight and I didnt want a period so I got it Ive been on it months and I havent stopped bleeding for days today HUGE clots started coming out and the cramps Omg theyre terrible Ive been so deppressed and have had no sex drive I will never use this form of birth control again Ive been eating paleo for a week and am pretty sure Im heavier then when I ate junk food I do not recommend at all
44,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42322,15,I received the depo shot right after I had essure surgery to block my tubes in I got my period about two weeks later and I never stopped bleeding for months I saw my doctor and she put me on hormone therapy did a DampC and I still continued to bleed By this time I was going through pads every hour I had to get up at night and change the bed sheets I was sent to the lab to have my blood drawn My red blood cell count was at Normal count for an adult woman is I was sent immediately to the hospital where I had two blood transfusions and a hysterectomy To this day my doctor doesnt know why I bled so much I keep telling her it was the depo shot and she continues to say I dont think that was it Dont Get the shot
45,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42322,12,So I just got my first depo shot today November Reading everyones experiences amp starting to freak out a little Hope I have an excellent one Only thing bothering me is the injection spot is sore Thats normal but I will definitely be posting updates so far so good
46,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42321,4,Ive taken shots so far and overall have had a very positive experience I had preeclampsia with both my babies so after my week pp visit my OB was concerned that taking the pill may affect and raise my blood pressure After the first shot I had an irregular period and bled off and on very lightly for about weeks After that I have not gotten it again and its awesome by the way The only other side effects that I have had besides the initial irregular bleeding is mild cramping off and on and I can see a difference in my temper I have definitely had some mood swings Overall it is working great for me and I would recommend giving it a shot pun intended
47,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42321,7,At first when I took the shot my life was good Just recently oct th I was due for another one weeks before the th I started to spot Ok I though because I was due soon It is now Nov th and still bleeding Due for another shot Dec I am so over it It will spot for awhile and then get heavy for about minutes I am so disgusted
52,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42374,5,I have had nothing but a great experience on this contraception Ive been on it for years with no side effects The pill was too cumbersome for me as I would forget or take late so the depo was the alternative I have never had a period when on it and will stay on it for that reason alone
55,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42373,5,So Ive been on depo provera for about a year and two months and there is positives to it but then there is also the negatives The first time I got the shot I bled for two months but its gotten lighter each shot and getting shorter for spotting and the periods going from two months to weeks Everytime I get the shot my period disappears for a while and then spotting will happen Im giving it a couple more times and if the periods dont die down then well Im stopping PostivesPeriods are getting shorter and I dont really have to worry till it gets close to my shotNo weight gain actually only a couple poundsNo cramps at allThe negativesWhen the periods start moodiness is horriblePeriod starting Spotting Tiny bit of bloating
58,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42371,13,I got on the shot July th Two weeks after I got the shot I had my period and it has been six months of me bleeding nonstop I would bleed heavy some days and light other days but not once have I went a day without bleeding Doctor keeps telling me its normal and I know it cant be My back hurts so bad sometimes I cant stand straight and these contractions I mean cramps are worse than my pregnancy Im an excercizing maniac and I still can not get rid of my lower stomach and I have a personal trainer Refuse to do the third shot
59,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42368,9,I got the shot and never stopped bleedingdischarging the entire months I was on it I refused to take the nd shot and after about a week after I was supposed to get it the bleeding started again I figured it was my normal period trying to kick back in but I continue to bleed to this day Itll be ridiculously heavy for a week then barely nothing for a few days then itll be ridiculously heavy again I got it in August and Im sure its the reason for why Ive been bleeding consistently for this last past month My period has never been irregular or anything Im so aggravated I feel disgusting and I cant enjoy everyday things without having to worry about whether or not Im gonna be bleeding through everything
60,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42366,4,I was told that I had to get two shots or else it could be potentially dangerous to be taken off of the shot Three months later and a ton of anxiety attacks and bleeding Im in the office going back on my pill The worst thing I couldve ever possibly done to myself was this shot
61,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42365,3,Depo shot I want to start of by saying that I know birth control affects everyone differently But I also feel that many girls arent truly warned about the side affects Before receiving the month depo shot I had to sign a form for bone loss But I did not have to sign a form about all the side effects that plagued me while on this shot and for months after An hour after receiving the depot shot I experienced my first panic attack Extreme fear nausea choking sweating all out of nowhere Then it happened again several hours later I took the shot only once Its been six months since I received the shot and Im now having another panic attack No one actually tells you that the depot shot remains in your system for up to months This doesnt even come close to the worst of it A month after my depo shot I started my period My period went from July to October NONSTOP Continual flow every day for five months It finally stopped when I ate a bunch of fresh ground flax seeds they have estrogen in them which helps repair uterine lining depo is progesterone which thins the uterine lining I only received one shot and my life has been affected for six months and counting Its amazing that my relationship survived the depot shot I hadhave an amazing man by my side who knew none of this was my fault and supported me the whole way But I truly could not have judged him if he left depo was horrible for our relationship Please please decide if these risks are worth it before you take this shot You cant remove it from your body but you can stop taking the pill if you react negatively
62,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42365,1,Im I started depo in April I was bleeding off and on big blood clots and I didnt take the second one Now its December I stop bleeding then it started again but now Im light bleeding and I only took depo shot
63,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42362,4,Very effective for birth control But the side effects are bled for two weeks non stop Going through depression horrible mood swings Would not recommend or reuse This is my first time getting it amp my last
66,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42359,17,I first got the shot back in September everything was fine I loved it no period It was awesome But at the end of November spotting started happening every day Different colors sometimes very heavy and then light clotted and here recently it has been going back and forth from a dark brown to a purple color and I do mean purple I have not gained any weight on this shot Ive actually lost pounds since October Reading other reviews I will not be going back for my second shot
67,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42358,8,weeks after giving birth to my son I chose to get depo I been bleeding on and off for months quot IM SO OVER THIS quot my side effects are being moody at times and Im losing my hair ladys your not the only one You have the right to switch up on your birth control
68,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42357,4,I am now part way through my rd shot of this injection Im and have had pretty much constant bleeding for the past months with only a few weeks of no bleeding I feel shattered constantly and have no energy The main way that its protected me from pregnancy is that I havent been able to even have sex due to constant bleeding This experience has been a nightmare for me its been painful and Ive felt rough and low the whole time I wouldnt recommend this at all as any side effects last for the months that it stays in your system
69,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42356,11,First time trying the shot I got the shot in September and everything was fine I have never had regular periods as far as coming when they should So I thought I would never have a period again November th comes around and Im spotting On the th my period comes I have been spotting different colors also Not to mention the stomach and back pains This whole process has been going on for weeks I know the pill gives you regular monthly periods which is something Id rather deal with Cant wait to switch back to the pill No nd shot for me
71,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42355,0,This shot was great the first month The second and third month I bled the entire time Im on day of continuous bleeding
72,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42355,0,I have been on the depo shot for about years now It has been amazing not having a period for years no cramps spotting or anything After I got my first shot I did have my period for a few months and it was heavy Once that passed I never had a period again I would really recommend the shot to anyone Downsides it costs me about every three months because my insurance doesnt cover it it also may have caused me to gain weight but I cant be sure of that
74,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42353,5,I had to write a review because most people go out of there way only to write one after a bad reaction but everyone is different I used depo for FIVE years and loved it Skin was perfect never gained weight in fact it seemed like I almost couldnt gain weight haha and my emotions were totally level I never had a period either Because it can effect your bone density I decided to switch to another birth control HATED my life I gained weight had chronic fatigue quotmorning sicknessquot severe depression This was from nexplanon I have since been off birth control and regulating my body Before I was on depo I took the pill which made me so sick everyday now that Im in a relationship Im returning to depo
77,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42319,2,Have been on depo for probably around years since I was I chose the injection for convience and to help with my periods as they are heavy and extremely painful often making me vomit from excessive pain First year of being on depo was ok would still always spot and would always get a period before my months was up I swapped backw to the pill for two months then went back to the depo because I was forgetting to take my pill and did want to risk pregnancy Going back onto the injection was the worst decision I could have made I have been back on it for at least months and I bleed after months for about weeks and currently I have been bleeding for over months Never getting this shot again
78,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42319,2,The shot was my first experience and method of birth control I was scared the most of the weight gain more then anything else After reading reviews on different birth controls and peoples experiences with it I couldnt bare the fact of gaining so much weight After having the shot gaining weight wasnt an issue with me i actually lost weight it was my hormones and emotions were crazy For months my mood swings were unbarreable It ruined relationships with me and my boyfriend It made me very depressed and sad causing me to major outbreaks Now that I am off it i feel so much more calm and like myself Worst months of my life The only good thing was my nauesa wasnt too bad and i only got my period twice
80,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42317,6,I had gone to my obgyn for my week postpartum check up She discussed the different options for birth control Since I am Breast feeding I wanted to make sure I chose an estrogen free method So the depo shot would do I thought since its good for months After the first weeks of being on the shot I started spotting for weeks and then the bleeding got heavier and heavier I also felt like I was getting weaker and feeling more tired than ever I would not recommend the depo shot and Im going to just take the pill next time around
81,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42317,4,Took the shot for three years and it was horrible I started taking the depo shot for veey heavy bleesing The firat shot worked amazing and stopped the bleeding after about ten minutes taking it But it all went down hill from there I would bleed for months until it was time to take the shot again then I would stop for two weeks and it would start all over again Now I have two kids and I tried the shot again since your body changes every time you have a baby Well nothing has changed so I called my OB office and am now switching to a different type of BC I do not recommend this depo shot for anyone
82,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42316,19,Depo stopped my period when I got my first shot Almost a week later I started spotting I had been consistently spotting for about three weeks Then I just started bleeding more It wasnt bad but its progressively gotten heavier with large clots Been over days now Ive had headaches acne increased appetite no sex drive painful sex fatigue chills abnormal bleeding Worse decision Ive ever made
83,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42316,4,I started the shot in th grade before high school Im now a junior and considering a different method I was pounds for a few years before I started Now Im and still climbing The hormones make me feel hungry all the time Joining a fitness club for a year did not help either I feel moody often and sad It did a great job of protecting me and preventing pregnancy I barely have a period and when it does come it seems to be off and on for about weeks For anyone considering this just be careful of what you eat and make sure your already exercising Dont listen to your brain telling you that your hungry listen to your stomach
84,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42314,8,Got my first shot May it didnt seem to make me feel funny etc In early July I had my first period the cramps were so bad I left work early August I started my period August th i got my shot still bleeding to this day Its been almost months and I am still bleeding It sucks My sex drive is completely gone No wonder its effective constsntly bleeding and guys disgust you lol I do not recommend this product but each woman is different Im also going to try Mirena if the bleeding ever stops
85,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42313,7,I dont recommend this shot to any female whatsoever its the worst thing you could do to yourself Im years old amp Ive been on the shot for about years now Im not using the shot had actual birth control just for controlling my period amp the awful cramping I would get When I first got my shot I was bleeding for a few months straight but then I never got a period AGAIN Two days ago I was laying in bed when I got God awful cramps amp I know these cramps for anywhere Im bleeding a bit which is reddish brown but only when I wipe amp these cramps are horrible My mood swings have been terrible with this shot amp the weight gain is ridiculous I wont be getting my next shot in January its not worth it I hope the cramps stop soon
86,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42313,11,I got my first shot Aug I started bleeding Aug its lasted for two weeks then I was off two weeks Then I started bleeding September th and I didnt stop bleeding until I got my nd shot Oct BESIDES the bleeding it is very good on birth control I read a lot of experiences on how woman got their first shot and bled a lot and didnt go back to get the next one My doctor told me that will make you bleed even more in making the decision to get the shot be aware you might bleed a little more than usual but in due time around the nd or rd shot you will stop bleeding period I havent bled since I got the nd shot and Im hoping it stays this way
87,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42313,3,I was on depo for only a few months I will say your better off being pregnant You feel every symptom of pregnancy and even get a prego tummy Seriously everyone asks me if I am pregnant Its so embarrassing The symptoms are the worst Ive had the worst acne break out Pains in my stomach I cant stop gaining weight in my stomach Good news is it does prevent pregnancy but its honestly not worth everything you go through Like those weird medications that say you may die but its effective All I am saying is depo will change your life and in a not so lucky way I would have rather of just been pregnant Instead I look and feel pregnant with no baby Mind you I am a skinny person very petite its extremely noticeable
88,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42311,8,My experience with Depo has been wonderful I had horrible cramps and long heavy periods before I started the shot After about months I stopped having a period at all which was great No surprises Also I lost about pounds on it I was previously on ortho tri cyclin lofe The pills made me gain weight the weight loss without trying was fabulous I dont feel tired or achey The only negative was I have had some acne return its nothing that a touch of makeup cant fix But from having blemish free skin to a few pimples is a little annoying I will continue to stay on the shot until I decided to start thinking about having kids Until then Ill deal with a couple pimples and enjoy my skinny period free life
89,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42311,4,Depo shot EASY FORGET ABOUT THE PILL I started the depo provers shot after having two kids birthed one year one day apart Both times I was on the full pill Was easy price is every three months on health care card Wasnt a stressful process was easy pain free I did bleed the first injection out of the weeks I bled heavily but after second shot I have overcome that and I am extremely happy in the success of this needle Its not costly it doesnt hurt its once every weeks dont need to stress about babies and pregnancy people are different some will bleed some wont Yes a tad weight gain but hey weight is better then an unwanted pregnancy
91,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42310,2,I have been getting the depot for years I absolutely love it I have never had a period or spotting in this time I no longet get cramps i dont crave junk food or sook at that time of the month It is completely hassle free My partner has noticed good changes in my moods I have put on a couple of kilos but i also have thyroid issues Every months i go to my doctor for mins to get a needle and a brief check up and im on my way again Its absolutely amazing I wouldmt use anything else
92,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42309,12,Ive had it and I have break through bleeding here and there very light but lasts for a while Ive noticed a slight shift in mood and I havent brook out as much Still cramps around period time but rarely bleed but my sex drive has depleted completely I hate it Excellent at preventing pregnancy but thats only because you lack the motivation for sex
93,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42309,15,After I had my baby my Dr Suggest that I get on birth control the depot is earlier to take every months So I decided go with that birth control method I got the depot shot Sept th come Oct I get on my period its an irregular period I usually bleed for to days Now I bleed heavier amp longer its been days amp counting Im not due Dec th for another shot Im definitely not continuing this depot shot I been depressed very emotional moody and my attitude has changed since I been on this shot I constantly argue with my boyfriend This shot have a lot of bad side effects but I havent been feeling like my normal self since I been on this shot I wouldnt recommend this shot anyone please go with other options
94,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42307,6,I got the shot at my first weeks check up after I had my baby and I bled months straight it finally stopped and then every other month I will bleed heavy for a few days and it continues on and on I have gained so much weight off of this shot it just makes my body feel funny I wont be continuing this shot Dont take the shot
95,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42307,11,I took this birth control about a month ago and at first I loved it I was spotting for about a week after I got it and then I stopped for maybe a month days ago I started spotting a brown color period blood No its very prominent heavy and red Ive been on this period for days now and Im sick of it Im very moody and ALWAYS hungry Always tired and always have headaches Im never irritable and this is not me Ive gained pounds And yeah this medicine helps prevent pregnancy but only because you cant have Sex Your always bleeding an moody Who wants to have sex under those predicaments I would never recommend this medicine to anyone An I sure am never ever getting it again
96,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42307,31,So my doctor prescribed me provera mg for days amp it completely stopped the bleeding thank god days later i got my peeiod with the worse cramps ever and i was bleeding really heavy with lots of bloods clots It was so uncomfortable
99,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42305,0,I decided to start taking the birth control shot after the birth of my son I figured it would be worth the convenience of getting the shot every months and not having to remember to take a pill Ever since Ive started getting the injections my side affects has been SEVERE mood swings DECREASE in my libido cramping and nausea Ive never liked the idea of not having a regular cycle however taking birth control does alter your menstrual cycle Im going to have to consider other options for birth control I cant deal with my severe mood swings Im starting to lash out against my family and it hurts Im a young year old and my sex drive has gone completely down hill
100,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42233,2,Depo was not for me but that does not mean it wont work for you It definitely did its job preventing pregnancy I was told the shot lasted months After my three months I didnt go back to get another shot because my husband and I wanted to have a baby It didnt happen for over a year AFTER those three months passed We had another child so it wasnt because Im not fertile I was also suicidal after getting depo Not your average depressed but actually suicidal and so crazy depressed that I wanted to die and had no clue why I lost a lot of hair when I would brush it I didnt gain weight My worst side effect was the depression It was unbearable to the point that I almost took my own life But it surely can prevent pregnancy
101,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42231,17,Ive been on this medicine for years now and have not had any negative side effects For those of you reading this you shouldnt let somebody elses review determine what her or not you take this medicine that should be decided after a long talk between you and your doctor Every bodys body is different so these reviews can not give a completely accurate description of whats going to happen to your body Im my experience I had irregular bleeding for about months but that is the time it took my body to adjust to the medication If you have irregular or constant bleeding for more than six months which is two cycles of the medication then you may want to talk to your doctor because the medication might not be the right one for you
102,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42230,5,I have had no negative side effects wit this birth control I have tried about ten different kinds of birth control pills before trying Depo and all of the pills made me an emotional mess I have no complaints about Depo I didnt gain weight no periods no crazy emotions
103,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42230,7,I didnt get pregnant which is the only reason Im rating this a I have been bleeding for days straight as of today Since I got the shot I have experienced severe fatigue hour long headaches appetite issues inability to get out of bed and horrible cystic acne
104,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,42229,18,I have been on the shot for almost two months and I absolutely hate it When I got the shot I was actually due for my period and never got it I ended up getting my period about weeks ago and have not stopped bleeding I can not have sex I cant wear white pants because its so heavy I cant go to the bathroom number or number because it hurts so bad I have had horrible cramps I dont sleep Im exhausted all the time and I am constantly feeling grumpy At this point I almost feel like nothing is going to help my endometeriosis Im years old and due to be married in a month and I cant even have sex because it hurts so bad I would not recamend this shot its a waste of time and causes false hope
106,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42226,1,Ive been on the shot for about a year now and i absolutely hate it Ive gained so much weight and were talking like lbs Its like i cant stop eating My cravings are absolutely horrible Im always hungry I work out here and there but i cant seem to lose the weight Im years old This birth control method is not something i would suggest to anyone except for the fact that it is very effective against pregnancy
107,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42226,1,So Ive been going back and forth between Sprintec and Depo for the last year I was on Sprintec from the age of because of horrible cramping I loved the pill but could never remember to take it so I was on my period all of the time I tried depo I dont really remember the first time taking it except for having some vaginal dryness and I lost my boobs at years old not the most exciting combination So I got back on the pill same issues of forgetting to take it and went back to depo for some reason I cant explain to myself It was a horrible decision My mood swings are ridiculous my anger is out of control Im constantly bloated Ive become very constipated spotting comes out of no where and Im constantly exhausted
108,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42226,10,Ive been on the depo two times now The first time started in and I took it for years I had no problems at all with it Then in February I decided to get back on it and the first shot went good until towards the end of it and I started spotting Didnt think to much of it since I had been off it for a few months I thought it was just normal Got my second shot in may It has been a terrible experience Ive bled literally the whole months Me and my boyfriend cant have sex because that just makes it worse My sex drive has plummeted Im due for another shot sometime this month Not gonna get it I actually have a dr Appt tomorrow regarding the bleeding I Dont recommend No one should have to go thru this
110,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42225,24,This was awful I got my first shot at UVA two days after my first baby was born They pushed it in me and didnt mention any side effects Stopped bleeding from giving birth three weeks later After about a week it started again and hasnt stopped I got a second shot because they told me that can happen from my body getting used to the hormones But I never went back for my third Over six months later Im still bleeding almost a month after I shouldve gone in for a third shot I dont know what to do Its exhausting Im constantly tired moody and depressed and I want to eat everything in sight I wouldnt recommend this method of birth control for anyone
111,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42225,33,First time I took Provera it worked great for years and made me regular I had gone to the ER for heavy bleeding and clotting nd time I went to the ER was earlier this year for same reason Provera slowed it down passed clots and then I spotted here and there Just recently mid July I started having heavy bleeding again and the docs couldnt give me answers as to why but put me on Provera again Didnt do anything this time It slowed it down on DayDay on it and then after and especially when I finished Provera I was bleeding very heavily The doc said thats to be expected and have to wait it out and just wait for my ultrasound Im so sick of all this bleeding and even more so not getting any answerstreatment
112,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42224,23,I took depo in January while I was on my period After my period stopped like a few days laterIi started spotting and it never stopped I told the doctor but they insisted that it was a good method so I took it again and scheduled the next shot The spotting never stopped I had a terrible appetite my moods were changing like I never went back to get the third shot I regret ever taking depo I feel like Im never going to have my regular menstrual cycle or have the sex I had before or stop using pantie liners This is very frustrating
113,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,6,42223,12,Im and was prescribed provera because on August of this month will be months I havent had my period I have been reading about it like crazy My test results came back normal Can someone tell me that after the th day on the pill I will get my period I have severe headaches and bloating
114,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42223,24,I found this site and comments of great interest My daughter had a shot earlier this year and complained of continuous bleeding not spotting feeling bloated nausea headaches cramps and very depressed and emotional She went other doctor who has put her on antidepressants and pills to supposedly stop the bleeding a week on still bleeding My daughter is and has changed from a lovely bubbly happy person into an ill zombie who sits on the sofa all day fatigued and in pain I certainly intend to seek legal advice
115,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42222,5,I have had injections and am discontinuing the drug after months In my opinion it is just not worth it I experienced extreme nausea for or days within the first months of getting the injection My periods came early and lasted week I had many anxiety episodes and mood swings Nearing the time of my second injection I experienced extremely heavy bleeding for days Im talking new super tampons every hours with a regular pad for inevitable leaks and even fainted during this time months later and most of my symptoms have gone but Ive had my period since my second injection over months ago At least it has been effective in preventing pregnancy the combination of these symptoms leave me with no desire for sex
116,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,7,42222,9,Hi Im years old and ever since Ive had my first period its been irregular Ive even been up to months without it Its my first time with provera I got my period two days after days of taking the pill The only side effects that I have had are that Ive sort of had hair loss and frequent headaches Other than that Ive always had PMS
117,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42219,8,Worst thing ever Effective yes but destroy ladies body especially when you stop using it I would never recommend it I wish I had never taken it I took shots yet it was enough to mess up my whole cycle Uncontrolled bleeding Unaware when to expect blood or not Z percent bad
118,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42219,51,If I could give this shot rating I would Lets start with Ive always had a normal period before this unexplained side effect of a shot This shot was administer to me in April and I didnt stop bleeding until July st After doing my own research and taking matters into my own hands it has finally stopped I went to the doctor countless of times trying to figure out how to stop the bleeding I took BLACKSTRAP MOLASSES if I could type that in bold letters and in a bigger font I would When I tell you on the first day of taking it the bleeding was much lighter and on the th day it was gone All I took was one tablespoon daily
119,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42217,56,I was bleeding heavily for a month with extremely large blood clots that made it difficult and stressful to even leave the house It was seriously affecting my quality of life and emotional well being My Dr prescribed Provera mg twice a day for ten days After the second dose the blood clots had completely disappeared By the third dose no bleeding at all This medicine was like a miracle for me I am happy to have my life back I noticed I am having a headache but its not that bad Ill take a headache any day over the suffering I endured with that excessive bleedingclotting
120,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42217,8,Ive been on Depo twice First time I was on it for about years and now Im on it again and its been months The first time I was on it absolutely loved it No horrible side effects This second round though I have gained some weight which is no biggie because I do like my bigger butt lol I think Depo is awesome and its really convenient and easy
121,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42216,1,Ive been taking depoprovera since May I havent had a period since but very light spotting from time to time This my rd year on birth control and after my last shot on July Ive been bleeding uncontrollably I dont know whats wrong but its literally making me feel sick Light headed due to low iron I dont know if I should stay on it or not
122,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42211,1,Well Ive been taking depo for over a year now since I had my first child I took my last shot in April and Ive decided not to take another shot because of all the bleeding Ive been doing I was supposed to take another shot on July th but didnt and that didnt seem to help because Im still bleeding like crazy I have been bleeding for almost month Its crazy
123,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42211,10,After the birth of our son my husband and I decided that the shot would be our best option Didnt have to take a pill every day and no periodsSo on July I had my first shot I began soaking through to tampons daily I was hospitalized for that and once again for a fainting episode due to anemiaI never went back for my second shot It is now just over a year later I am still bleeding My husband and I havent had sex for a year because of the intensity of the pain and bleedingI have tried everything from soy isoflavones to ibuprofen and iron to estrogen therapy to other forms of birth controlThey say I have to let it wear off but its so bad that I have trouble caring for my child because of fatigue
124,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42210,14,I have bled for months straight since I took a shot of depo provera I started bleeding weeks after for months I have finished over tablets of tanxeric acid to help stop the bleeding at different times The bleeding reduces when am on the tablet and continues after days I regret ever taking depo provera Am still praying for the bleeding to stop I know am at the last stages before the side effect completely leaves my body more month to make it months if it continues I will look for any available option to completely stop it My Doctor didnt tell me the side effects before I took the shot Ive been on iron every day for months I also take multivitamin and vitamin C This is a horrible experience for meNEVER AGAIN
126,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42350,19,So I get on this shot to control my bleeding since I was going on vacation and I didnt want to be on my period while on vacation I was so crazy to get on this shot because my tubes are tied but my period was out of control so I got on the shot Why did I do this to myself I took my first shot on started bleeding I kept bleeding so I called the doctor to ask her what to do she said to take ibuprofen pills times a day and it should slow it down Nope never stopped so I decided to get another shot What was I thinking doing that To this day IM STILL BLEEDING SINCE my attitude is thru the roof my marriage is suffering Im depressed cuz Ive gained so much weight I have constant headaches etc
127,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42350,4,Depo was the worst thing I could have done to my body After one shot was horribly moody my skin broke out and I gained weight I never got another one but I bled for months straight and the only way I could stop it was going on the pill DO NOT USE THIS FORM OF CONTRACEPTION
128,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42350,34,I went almost months without a period I shouldve known I was in for trouble but I just let it slide until the day I started my period I bled for weeks non stop It was very heavy with lots of large clots I went to the ER eventually and the Dr prescribed me provera mg for days It was awesome for days almost no bleeding just spotting here and there I came off of provera and days later Im bleeding times worse and a lot more clots then I was before taking the drug Somethings got to give I just want to be able to be normal again
129,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42349,27,I was bleeding large clots nonstop for months I kept going to the ER and they did nothing The last time I went my RBC count was so low I had to have blood transfusions along with surgery I was given Provera to take I have been taking it now for days and the blood is completely gone I am just worried it will come back when the pills are gone
132,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,5,42347,4,I have was dx with endometrosis back in I have had chest tubes surgeries within years I was also dx with catamenial puemothorax which you can google to get more info about but it has a lot to do with my period etc it all goes together But I have been on birth control pills lupron and now on the depo And I must say the only think that helps was the lupron besides of the side effects of hot flashes cold sweats etc But the pill was a no go I didnt like how it made me feel and I have been on the depo shots for a few months but I must say it worked in the st few months but now i have been bleeding for he last months nonstop and I am just stop everything cause Im so over with trying different things its so frustrating
134,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42346,1,My Dr Suggested it after my rd childso I decided to get it I missed the first period After taking the shot but started for the second one Ive been bleeding for a month straight now Its increased my appitite making me gain pounds in monthsIve recently started working out so Ive been trying to loose it Ive never had an acne problem but now my face breaks out terribly too Ive been moody with crazy head aches It is a hormone So obviously its going to have some hormone related side effects Read the pamphlet check out reviews Remember its an injection of hormones into your body doctors dont know exactly what the side effects youll have if you have anybasically youre a human lab rat
135,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42346,6,Ive had shots and go for my rd one the th of this month I never bled when I got my first shot I didnt bleed at all until August I bled for an hour one day and that was it it happened again in September and not again until now I started after I had sex with my boyfriend one night and bled the next day but it quit that night and it wasnt bad I went the next day without bleeding until that night I bled but not much at all Didnt bleed for days and then it came back but it was brownish This has happened the past weeks I know I get my shot in a few days but its never been this irregular But it hasnt made me lose my lose my sex drive at all and I havent gained any weight on it
137,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,2,42345,5,I was recently put on depo provera as a lastditch effort prior to undergoing a full hysterectomy to relieve serious pain from endometriosis While it has been effective for relieving the pain I have been heavily spotting or more for over months now every day I decided not to get another shot and I am now experiencing random horrible stabbing pains in my ovary not like the endometriosis pain Pain aside months of feeling too gross to have sex I feel bad for my husbandI was on depo for years during my younger years and never had any issues I stopped taking it because I thought I was going to be able to have children that turned out to not be the case so I thought it couldnt hurt to try it again bad choice
138,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42345,6,I havent had any serious complications like most of you have Ive only had slight weight gain very headaches and just irregular spotting that would go away within a couple of days of start My sex drive is the same I love the fact that I dont have periods Everyone is different Id recommend it
139,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42344,3,I recently had child number two at age so I dicided to try a new for of birth control was on the pill for two years but got pregnant on it so I got the shot on November and started bleeding on December and it now December and I am still bleeding I am a bit worried seeing that its my first time on the shot I have a little mood swing and lost of energy and lost of appetite I dont think I will get another shot if the bleeding doesnt stop soon and the cramps r painful I got the shot cause I was told there would be no period and I am still bleeding
140,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42342,5,Ever since I took this shot I have been having extreme shooting pains up my arm and terrible headaches I am really scared and have been bleeding for three weeks straight I would give anything to have never taken this shot right now
141,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42342,21,I recieved my second shot at the beginning of November I had been bleeding constantly for almost weeks beforehand and have continued to bleed every day since I despise wearing a pad as I find them unsanitary and smelly but not quite enough blood to warrant a tampon Enough to make walking running amp standing uncomfortable and sex is absolutely out if the question
143,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42340,4,Ive been on depo for about years nowPROs depo is convenient and prevents pregnancy from what I read I know I havent gotten pregnant while being on it Also I have had blood clots in past so it was a good alternative to the pill which can cause blood clotsCONs spotting ALL the time As I was reading this I just realizedremembered that my Dr told me to prevent this the Dr can alter the dose of the medicine so if this is an issue for you please talk with your doctor and dont be lazy like me libido definitely has gone down if youre on it for over years it can really negatively affect your bone density Im getting off of it for this reason
144,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42339,3,While the irregular periods frequent spotting and slightly heavier periods are a drag the shot has worked very well for me It is very effective at preventing pregnancy and is lowmaintenance All you need to worry about is getting the shot every monthsMy periods werent bad before the shot and theyve stayed exactly the same besides being unpredictable Just have to worry about changing my padtampon No bad cramps same amount of acne as usual and no side effects to speak ofIm only on my th month of the shot now and Ive heard that after months the periods typically become more predictable at least and less blood is shed from spotting Quite a few women stop having their periods actually which is what Im hoping for
148,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42335,3,I started taking the Depo shot when I was however it did help effectively with me not getting pregnant and I did not have any periods for four years but it caused me to have crazy mood swings insane depression and made me feel down all the time I switched to the birth control pill now that Im and I dont feel like Im going completely crazy now So I do not recommend this birth control at ALL
151,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42274,12,Im reading all these reviews and Im puzzled Ive been on Depo for nearly years with a few breaks and this month is the first time Ive ever even spotted Ive never had a period or cramping the rest of the time Ive been on it I do think its attributed to some minor weight gain Im actually wondering if there was a bad batch of this out out within the last year considering all these reviews about bleeding are so recent
152,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42272,17,I started DepoProvera in July of One month after I started spotting then bleeding heavily Its now almost months and Im still bleeding I was very worried that it couldve caused some other problem until I read the reviews and realized that other women are experiencing the same problem Please stay away from this drug
153,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42270,1,Im years old and feet tall pounds In August I had the Depo Shot worst decision ever A year later and I gained poundsWhen I was in middle school I was pounds as well but in high school I dropped a lot of weight and was in the most of the time until I got the depo shot I have tried my regular ways of losing weight exercising dieting meal replacements HCG diet and also Insanity These all worked previously for me but not nowI started Isagenix and Im optimistic because I have friends that all used this product and lost weight I think it might work on me too despite of the Depo Shot
156,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,7,42269,24,I hate this medicine Took for days and did get my period the last day st day was light but since than its been cramps that I can barely move amp heavy heavy bleeding On day and in the last hrs Ive leaked xs Once was in an hr period from the last leak It causes your period but be warned it can be horrible Was told to expect heavy but this is rediculous right now On top of everything Im amp having hot flashes from side effects massive headaches while taking the meds and pms which I never have
159,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42266,35,This stops the bleeding I have been bleeding heavy for weeks This worked and i actually feel better Happier and more energetic
160,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42265,19,I am years old and i gave birth April to my beautiful daughter I got the depo shot and havent stopped bleeding since It has days when it stops for half the day but doesnt completely go away and all of a sudden I started having brown stuff come out Idk what that means but lets hope it means its going away for good Never getting any birth control again Too many side affects
161,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42265,5,I received my injection on July I was on my last day of my period and since then I have only had mild spotting I experienced some pain on the injection site that went away after a couple days to a week Very few mood swings I gained six pounds since then I am considering not going in for the second injection because I fear I will gain more weight and have worse side effects Also you are expected to take calcium supplements since it sucks the vitamin D andor calcium out of you Which is hard for me because if I wanted to take a pill everyday I would have just got that I have had a pleasant experience on depo but I am worried about the future
162,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42264,6,Been on depo for about two years I think maybe two and a half At first it was fine It stopped my periods almost completely with occasional spotting around the time my periods should be But since my last injection Ive gained pounds developed terrible acne and over the past two months have bled every single day Sometimes a little sometimes enough to soak through a tampon in an hour I normally gain pounds on other forms of birth control but with the added in the past few months Ive gained a total of pounds since starting depo Thats crazy Ive always had really clear skin but noticed a significant decline when I first started depo and in the past two months my skin has just gone crazy it looks terrible
163,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42264,15,I got the shot last month to help with my endometriosis I was on my period at the time after my period stopped everything was fine but once I got my period things started to go down hill not by much I started my period and it wasnt so heavy at first and my pain was gone but now Im stuck on my period I have been bleeding for over two weeks now and cramps come and go my face broke out and hasnt stopped which is weird for me because it doesnt ever last this long Im really starting to think its not worth it if Im still on my period all the time because now I feel like I cant do much like swimming or being crazy active because I feel weak and just drained
164,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42263,7,Ive been on it for about months Im supposed to get my next shot but Im not I would rather get my regular cycle back than the depo I had a lightish period for months with a few days every so often that it would stop but start again at night I was told that after months it should stop After a few weeks of month it was still going Finally it stopped for a good month I was so glad I thought it was over I was wrong Ive had a period for months straight again but this time its a regular month long period that hopefully stops I just want to go back to a normal cycle again Ive also been moody impatient gained some weight more acne I wasnt like that before The depo sucks
166,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42261,1,Do not use It did not work as an effective birth control Was successfully on the pill for tears got pregnate on the shot
167,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42260,3,Iv been on depo for years and I can say its better than other birth controls you deffanitly wont get pregnant its probly hard to conceive even after you stop getting it I have gained about lbs mostly always hungry I get acne on an off an have mood swings Im thinking about getting off of it cus I heard it decreases bone mass an putting that in your body for long time cant be healthy
168,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42260,16,I absolutely hate this I have been on depo for months and I have bled the whole time Non stop No breaks Its not light either Its like being on the second day of your period FOREVER It has also significantly worsened my depression I had finally gotten a combo of meds and therapy that had me feeling relatively functional I made the mistake of taking depo It ruined all my progress and has me debating suicide again Ive gained weight and developed acne This sucks dont ever take it Theyll tell you it can stop your periods Dont be deceived
170,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42258,8,My normal periods involved changing a super plus tampon hourlywearing an overnight pad for days then medium flow days severe diarrhea vomiting and extreme bloating and very paining cramps heavy cloting I decided to try this and the first two weeks were great no bleeding or pain then I got my period and it was very light with minimal cramps for one day I was soooo happy I cried One month later Im still bleeding Its super light and I only see light pink blood when I wipe I hope it ends soon going to give it time and a few more shots I dont think anyone should get this shot unless they were in my position with an abnormal heavypainful period I rather have light spotting for months than one week of extreme pain
171,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42258,4,The depo shot was convienent Loved not having to take a pill everyday At first things were fine then I slowely started to develop severe depression all the way to suicidal thoughts And trust me Im the happiest person alive I was so confused what was happeneing I only got shots and then I switched to sprintec pill Within a week of being off the depo I felt like myself again I would rather take pills a day then to feel what I felt on the depo

183,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42245,10,I have PCOS and have done for nearly yrs Periods lucky if I had one a year then started to have irregular bleeds Was sent for biopsy and scan results showed complex focal hyperplasia Gyn but me on provera daily I am now entering my th week of really heavy bleeding and large cots along me depressed tired and ruling my life Was talk of hysterectomy but Im petrified of such a major op any help will be gladly appreciated
185,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42244,2,I was on this method of birth control from age I loved it I never noticed a weight gain no periods at all for this entire time In retrospect that probably isnt healthy but at the time it didnt bother me in the slightest I had pretty intense mood swings but I was also In a very unstable relationship at the time so Im not going to pin the mood swings entirely on the depo I recently switched to Trinessa pills and absolutely hate them I never realized how happy I was with the depo shot until I started something else Im slightly concerned with the long term effects of the shot but I might end up switching back to it I know it has a rep for making people gain crazy weight but it didnt have that effect on me
187,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42243,5,This had been my third time with depo I had taken it twice before after my first two babies and had regular periods and no other side effects So I thought nothing of it when they suggested it after my third born I feel like they always urge me to stop reproducing even after my healthy birth Four weeks to the day after my third birth I was given depo and have not stopped bleeding since Thats over four months of bleeding now I didnt go back for the second shot at three months From yucky dark thick blood to a river there is no stopping it Along with all the joys of being on your period Im moody and depressed I cant even go back to work
188,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42241,5,Experienced abnormal continual bleeding once shot was administered for months Convenient contraceptive after all Also experienced rapid weight gain bloating and fatigue Wouldnt recommend to friends
189,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42241,6,This is a horrible horrible drug I had an pharmacological abortion in November on the same day I was administered a shot of depot provera and was due another one in February I was bleeding for the whole months without stopping Went to GP who send me for a scan to exclude any tissue from termination left in the uterus Everything was clear Blood test was good I refused further depot shots and said I want to have normal periods back It is August now months from the date when I was due another shot and I am still bleeding erratically I do have a bit more bleeding that I think is my period for around weeks and then it stops for days and then spotting returns I am furious and extremely worried
190,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42241,3,I got my very first Depo shot in May and got my period on schedule in June except it lasted for weeks Two weeks after it ended I got my period again July th and have been on it for the past weeks going on Im waiting for it to bleed out but it recently got heavier Ive called around to different offices and theyve said the same thing that I should just get another shot and that irregular bleeding is normal for the first months I was having debilitating cramps in June which Im pretty sure is linked to the shot because Ive never felt that pain before Other than that I havent had cramps at all I did notice that I am extremely angry on this birth control and I started breaking out on my cheeks
191,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42240,14,The depo is different for everyone which I have found out The only reason I got the depo is because it was highly recommended by people who have not experienced periods while on it did not get a period in the first month but the second month was bleeding for a full months and thats been my routine ever since will not be getting the th shot I have spoke to a nurse and both doctor about this and it is considered normal as you need at least in your system to get used to them but I am on the th and no change would not recommend
192,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42240,20,One thing for sure It definitely prevents pregnancy because you cant have sex due to the fact youre constantly bleeding I got my second shot on July th and I have been bleeding ever since with occasional clots and its almost the end of August Its very frustrating and annoying I definitely will not be getting the third shot And the medical facilities that provide the shot have no clue neveragain
193,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42240,3,I was on the depo shot for about a year I loved it I had no periods at all for the year I decided to try to conceive so I stopped getting the shot The month after I was due for my shot I got my period again Two weeks later and Im still bleeding I had very normal periods before the shot always days on time every month Im nervous about my fertility and the constant two weeks of bleeding I just hope it ends soon Im giving the shot an because I had no side effects or periods on the shot and I didnt get pregnant So I guess the birth control did its job
194,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42240,15,I got the shot in June it was great in the beginning I didnt have a period the first month the nd month came around and I got my period amp now its been a month and I am still bleeding I will never again get this shot I have severe cramps long lasting headaches For any woman looking to get on birth control I DO NOT recommend the Depo
195,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42238,9,I got the shot on July nd The day I got the shot I had experienced sharp cramps in my stomach Not even a week later I started bleeding not like my normal light bleeding This lasted for over a month I stopped the heavy bleeding on August th And now I am still bleeding just not as bad This is like a brown slime Its nasty as heck This is the first and last time I will ever get that shot Its ruining my attitude I am never hungry and I am dropping weight like no other Not to mention my sex life I am going in on September th to talk to my doctor about trying something else and to see how we can stop the bleeding once and for all
197,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42236,5,I loved the depo shot I was on it for just under two years and had no problems I used this as my only form of protection since I am in a committed relationship My only slight issue is that I gained alot of weight about pounds My doctor believes this is due to the stress of a new job a promotion And some life changes not the depo I quit the shot in order to confirm its been almost three months and Im still gaining weight so maybe the doctor was right I had no other side affects And no period from the day I started I havent gotten my period back in the last three months I plan to go back on the shot very soon Its the most convenient by far And despite the horror stories Ive never had a problem
198,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42235,6,I had regular periods until suddenly in June my period started and didnt end In July I went to my quottrustedquot family doctor and he assured me that the depo would stop the bleeding When the nurse was about to administer the shot she warned me and said you should get a second opinion I was so desperate and I trusted my family doctor so I decided the get the shot anyway Not only has the bleeding not stopped its worsened It is so bad that when I step out of the shower I have to use it tissue so it doesnt drip on the floor I have been bleeding for months I finally went to my gyno and he said I should never have gotten it in the first place and there is nothing he can do I need to let it bleed out Never again
199,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42235,7,Its a great contraceptive I cant possibly get pregnant Why Because Ive had my period for weeksThis is seriously the worst thing Ive ever had
201,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42285,9,This shot is no goodI gave birth on aug and at the hospital they gave me the depo shot before I was dischargedEverything was regular I was bleeding everything out then my weeks were up and I was still bleeding so I thought it was just my period but its now oct and Im still bleeding its so frustratingNo doctor told me that it made you bleed like crazy and also another nurse told me that this shot stops your breastmilk but no doctor is giving out this information I regret it
202,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42285,4,So glad to find this site and to read Im not the only one who has experienced awful side effects Only had the one injection and bar a couple of weeks in total I have bled the whole time This has been going on for almost months now Starting to affect my relationship Avoid like the plague if all the other reviews are anything to go by
203,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42285,11,I took the depo shot may only because the clinic pms suggested it and said it was covered by insurance and you wouldnt have to pay dollars a month for the prescription of birth control I was like sure this is alright and I took it while I was on my period after I took it it ended immediately and for the first month I was fine and didnt have to worry then I started to get the light spotting and looked up and said it was normal for a bit of spotting after a week it stopped for a day and then went full flow until now October and it stops for a day and comes back full force every now and then I only took the shot once and they said it would last for months I dont know what to do
204,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42285,5,Ive been on the depo for about years Im Its the only contraceptive that I could use because I have a gene in my blood stream that makes me twice as likely to get blood clots then any other person without it I had no issues what so ever being on it I never spotted I never gained weight I had an overall good experience being on it Now Ive been off of it since May I started spotting in August a sign that my body is going back to normal ish My withdrawal symptoms are starting to suck Over the last three days Ive had nothing but severe cramping that I cant function with Today being the third day Im finally experiencing a normal period Which the pain yeah it sucks but its a sign my bodys trying to go back to normal
206,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42283,8,I initially got this shot because I was told that it would completely stop your period Well its been months now and I havent stopped bleeding The first weeks were great then I got my period and havent stopped bleeding Its not a heavy period or anything just consistently light blood brown stuff It has been the most annoying thing ever Not only has that been bad but this shot made me super depressed emotional and moody Im honestly surprised my boyfriend is still with me Lol This has been such a horrible experience and I will definelty not be going back for another shot I cant wait to have my normal period back for just a week each month I will take a week of crampin over this shot anyday I Really wanted to like it
207,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42283,6,Im Ive been on the depo shot for and a half months Im due for my next one in a couple weeks and I really dont want it The first month was fine no side effects and got my period like normal it only lasted me days but the nd month was so bad Terrible back aches cramps mood swings when I first started out I had depression but its worse now to the point where I have suicidal thoughts the worst pain in my bones that wouldnt let me do simple things like bend over to pick something up get out of bed or pick up my nephew and I got my period weeks ago at the end of September and I still have it now in the beginning of October as heavy as ever Im scared about how long its gonna last
208,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42283,24,A few months ago I shared my horrid experience about this drug This drug increased my bleeding folds and continued for months of very heavy bleeding I went to a specialist and he said I should have never been prescribed depo and the effects irreversible and they stay in your body more than months and there is nothing that can be done You can only imagine my despair I did however manage to get in and see another doctor This doctor is my miracle She prescribed me yaz drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets The first days the bleeding increased tremendously but after that it COMPLETELY STOPPED To me this was a miracle I am sharing this hoping that it could bring women in my condition some relief
209,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42283,9,If you have got the depo shot and are now experiencing consistent bleeding thats dark in color I recommend seeing a gyno and getting the pill I bled from May until the end of September and a week after the pill I am blood free All my other side effects have also subsided GET THE PILL IT HELPS I SWEAR
213,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42282,0,Overall I feel the DEPO is excellent About years ago I started bleeding heavily and had an week long period I became anemic so they suggested the DEPO Oh my gosh it was awesome I always had a week long period every months right before I was due for the shot I am and thought I was getting menopause so I took myself off the shot After tests saying I wasnt menopausal I went back on the shot One shot and Ive had periods already with cramps like never before Time for a hysterectomy I think
218,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42278,5,My doctors office set me up with a nurse practitioner to discuss methods to reduce bleeding every month She suggested the Depo shot She felt it would be the answer to all my problems I said well what if I bleed more She assured me that it wouldnt happen if I got the shot on my first day of my period I had looked at reviews and done some research mostly it was negative but I assumed maybe the people leaving reviews were just the people that had a bad experience Since the day I got that shot I have been bleeding heavily like a regular Not spotting The nurse practitioner who recommended the shot would not admit that it was the shot making me bleed continuously It has been a week period and counting Im furious
219,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,5,42277,10,Im and came off the pill months ago after taking it for years Havent had a period for at least a year even when on the pillIm at the rd round of Provera I took it times for days and got no period after the daysNo negative side effects just dry mouthIts almost like I wasnt taking anything One positive thing though it seems to have cleared the skin rashes and fungus I started having a few months after coming off the pillDidnt bring my periods back but solved my skin issues
220,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42277,7,THIS DRUG IS A TOXIC POISON and should be BANNEDI took only one shot on June due to complaining about painful periods due to a fibroid Worst mistake of my life For the first month and a half i didnt have a period which was great Then on August st it started badly I woke up with blood clots the size of golf balls falling out of me and my entire uterine lining all at once like my intestines were falling out I havent stopped bleeding and have even been put on a BC pill acupuncture nothing works I was fainting went to the ER for blood transfusions Still hasnt stopped I pray to god every day to help HELP Ive been hemorrhaging for months now
222,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42276,5,I was on this birth control for month two when I started noticing side effects People say they never get a period I got mine THREE times in the span of a month and a half These were three FULL seven day periods with less than a week break in between I became insanely depressed and had anxiety I could not handle I spent every day crying because my emotions were out of control I contemplated suicide many times but never tried It took MONTHS to get back to some type of normal and even now a year and a few months later I still get AWFUL anxiety during my period and when Im ovulating Prior to the Depo Provera I never had depression or anxiety This was my first time and I pray that this will be my lastWouldnt wish it on an enemy
223,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42276,7,Weight gain mood swings stomach pain none existent libido migraines all this can be yours with a shot of depo
224,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42276,5,Consider something you like Say a favorite breakfast food or a place to go with friends Now think about something you care nothing about say the painted lines on a road or the bottom of your kitchen table Imagine that everything you like instead of being something nice you enjoy becomes as unimportant to you as the bottom of your table Work Favorite nephew Friday night Now you feel nothing either good or bad Thats depo provera Yeah you wont get pregnant but thats because you wont care about sex or your mate or anything Most awful weeks ever Good news though you wont care about your three month period either Or the enormous blood clots Or the long term damage like bone density loss and anemia
226,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42180,7,Do not get the shot I got the shot a while ago at first everything was alright but then I got my period which Ive had forever now it will not go away I get the worst headaches that Ive ever had before and they last all day and I get them everyday I feel sick And I also have started to feel super moody and sad out of no where My body gets achey and I am starting to gain weight definitely will not be getting the shot again its not worth it
227,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42180,7,This depo shot has been the best for me I have been on it a long time and I have had no side effects from it I feel full all the time and no pregnancy scares its really good
228,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42180,26,Warning Unless do you want your life turned completely upside down do not take this form of birth control I have been bleeding for months now Constant bleeding no breaks in between whatsoever Do not believe when the doctor tells you after your second or third shot itll stop It wont Ive had more than numerous tests done everythings normal Ive been to a specialist twice Everyone saids your body has to go back to normal on its own which could take up to a year or two At this point Im begging them to give me a hysterectomy Im only they wont Ive passed out twice already due to low iron because of blood loss Had a blood transfusion once because the blood loss Please explore your other options first
230,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42177,6,Ive been on the shot for about seven months now and havent experienced any of negative side effects that Id heard horror stories about no weight gain no unusual acne no unusual hair growth no significant appetite changes etc I did have pretty irregular spotting and bleeding for the first three months but now I cant remember the last time I saw any blood which suits me just fine Overall the drug has treated me pretty well I like not having to deal with my period each month the only downside for me is having to schedule regular Drs appointments to get the injection
231,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42176,12,This was the worst birth control method Ive been on I had a period that lasted weeks Thankfully my doctor prescribed me back to the pill and now the bleeding has stopped I also experienced serious mood changes I was constantly tired and upset I would wake up in the middle of the night drenched In sweat with a very fast heart beat
232,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42176,11,I had my daughter in February this year I received the shot the day I was released from the hospital The shot didnt hurt and didnt quell the after pregnancy bleeding I believe that was inevitable This shot hasnt made me gain weight at all Im lbs when I was lbs when I was at my last check up before I had my child The real problem with this is that I am a fricken mess I cry at the drop of a hat I have ZERO appetite and have to force myself to eat BUT I have longer thicker hair and my body hair didnt change Im blonde and itd be easy to tell The serious down side is that Ive been on the shot for months and HAVE NOT STOPPED BLEEDING Good lord Its been months of ruined panties and tampons
235,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42173,8,This was a huge mistake for me Do not take it I wish i read the reviews before i got it I only got one shot which last for months and only in three months igained pounds My life style didnt change I was working out pretty much every day and eating helthy still I got bigger than before Everything got worse when I discontinued the shot i got super sad and crying for no reason my energy is right now i just wanna be in bed all day i am sleepy during tye day The acne seems to increase a lot even in unusual areas like my scalp My period is super mess up i bleed for two months i dont wanna have sex I knew about the side effects before but I didnt know that it gets worse even stopping the shot this too much to handle
236,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42173,18,My experience on this shot was Awful to say the least I gained lbs and became extremely depressed and started having anxiety I only got the shot times and gained that much weight I am now struggling with body image due to this shot It had a huge effect on my joints as well I am now weak always sick have stomach issues and am always tired I never had any of these symptoms before starting it Not to mention it didnt help my period at all I was having if for weeks straight and a day between then Id start again I was perfectly healthy and it has ruined my life Never take this medicine
237,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42169,10,So Ive been on depo for two years now And Ill say it has been the worst Ive gained lbs I have constant headaches and backaches Im very moody I spot one month after getting the shot up until I get the next shot then it repeats I have bad cramps and lots of hot flashes Im getting off the shot next month because this just isnt the BC for me
239,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42167,5,This medicine made me have really bad mood swings I took it to stop bleeding Bleeding never stopped I even had thoughts of suicide Outburst of crying for no reason No thanks
241,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42165,40,Ive been on the depo for over two years now For the first months I experienced light bleedingspotting but the doctors told me to continue as it wont be long until my body got used to it After my third shot the bleeding just stopped completely It is best to carry on with it because I havent had a period in over a year just occasional spotting every couple of months if that Weight gain was a problem for me but Im not overweight and I can lose if I stick to a healthy diet Other than that Ive had no problem with the depo its really not as bad as people are making it out to be Once you get past the months of bleeding you dont have to worry about a thing
242,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42164,9,I was on Depo for about years My period would immediatly stop everytime I took the shot That is the only positive Aside from that I gained about pounds from the shot Thank God I was really small when I got on it and my fat is in the quot rightquot places However it doesnt change the fact that this is something that should not be on the market Doctors will tell you that it is your diet that is causing the weight gain However my diet is the same as it was years ago I decided to get off the shot as getting a period is a part of woman hood and not enough of a reason to keep injecting something that awful in my body I have been off about months now Thankfully my periods are regular now but I plan to see a dietician soon
244,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42161,21,I got on the shot on October th I thought it would end my periods but I ended up bleeding everyday for six months straight My third shot that I had got on April th ended the bleeding for about a month and a half and now Im bleeding again and this time Im having cramps as if Im on my period My next shot is on July th and I will not be going through with it The depo shot just ruins your body I hate it
245,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42160,20,I got on the depo not only for prevention of pregnancy but also everyone I know stopped getting their periods How awesome is that I was very skeptical about it because everyone I knew either gained an excessive amount of weight or just were not able to loose at all My experience was great for my first shot I got my period once throughout the months and I was still able to loose weight without any issues My problem started when I got my second shot About weeks after receiving the shot I got my period which was fine but that was April th and it is now June th and I still have Its not a heavy flow at all mostly just spotting and clotting Will not be receiving rd shot I want sex If the bleeding wasnt so much Id continue
246,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42159,17,I got my first shot April th My period was supposed to come May th and didnt It was a week late and Ive been bleeding and spotting ever since I have bad mood swings and get mad over absolutely nothing I get cramps all day every day and its it so horrible Its been almost straight weeks of bleeding sometimes heavily and other times just spotting I dont know if it even protects against pregnancy because you cant have sex if youre constantly bleeding I would NOT recommend this to anyone ever I have an appointment with my obgyn on Tuesday so I hope there is some kind of solution since I have to ride this out til the end of next month
247,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42159,7,I was on the depo for n a half years got off in Feburary started my period march Its now June and still bleeding I hate this bc
248,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42158,5,By the time I got my third shot all hell broke Ive been bleeding nonstop was given Orsythia to stop the bleeding and that didnt work After having a blissful time on the shot now my body is rejecting it I guess I wont be taking a fourth shot
250,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41973,33,I got this shot a few weeks ago and my side effects are already horrible I had anxiety before but now its so much worse My mood swings are unreal and my breasts have been so tender to the point where I cant touch them at all and theyve grown a ton Not to mention the few pounds Ive already put on in the short time I will never take the shot again I dont recommend this form at all Once you get the shot not matter how miserable the effects are you cant do anything about it Going back onto the pill once this wears off
251,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,41973,55,Hi Ive been on the shot since the beginning of May Ive been bleeding constantly for months with very frequent headaches I almost thought I was anemic at one point due to the shot However it was very effective in preventing pregnancy but definitely not worth all the other symptoms
252,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41965,28,I LOVE DepoProvera Only shot every months Unlike the stupid pill which I keep forgetting to take Weight gain is the only negative thing for me which I dont really care for No mood swings no period So Im super happy with my shot yay
253,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41960,40,I first tried the shot a few years ago I only got one shot For the very first time it lasted three months so did my period so I stopped I now have a son and I went back to the Depo shot and my body has seemed to work with it now I talked with my doctor and she said that very common and to just go through with the nd and rd shot Now I have no period and I dont have to remember to take a pill please give it another try
254,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41960,24,Two years on depo I have been combatting depression fatigue and vaginal dryness since my third shot hoping that I could overcome them or being in denial that is was from the shot but its definitely a side effect of the birth control Though the shot is convenient with no periods and strong hair and nails I totally feel like Ive been through menopause and am an old lady with NO sex drive Switching to the patch in December wish me luck
255,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,41957,35,Ive been on the shot since January and today is my st time bleeding Ive been on and off of it for over years and have never had bleeding while on After getting off at times Ive had constant abnormal bleeding until period regulated again
256,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41957,15,Im going to be soon I had really heavy periods for days straight and my period would come a week early It was regular just less than a month until each one and I also had really bad cramps to the point where I couldnt move The pill was my first option and it made me bleed for months straight A while later I was considering birth control and I finally chose the DepoProvera it was the perfect choice for me Once I got the shot I never got a periodany bleeding again I personally didnt gain any weight All the side effects didnt bother me And works well against pregnancy Ive saw a lot of bad reviews but mine was perfect so everyones body is different I would recommend talking to your doctor Heshe will know whats best
257,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,41957,23,I have been on it now for yrs amp love it Before I would be in bed for weeks with bad cramps it was destroying my life I get little cramping well the shot is due but I can live with that
258,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41948,92,I thought the shot would be easy due to the fact of taking it every three months compared to the pill taking it everyday but the shot does not work for my body I have been bleeding for over a month now I am going back to the pill
260,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41940,40,Didnt get pregnant but how could I when I bled for months straight And gained weight
261,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41939,41,I have been using the Depo for years now I noticed during the first year I would spot lightly when I usually got my period and my cramps went away After the first year my period pretty much went away for the most part However when I do occasionally get spotting it lasts for about weeks and it comes at random times In the past year I can recall it happening three times For me it still beats getting reglar periods and it has taken away my horrible cramps so I deal with it The pill always made me sick no matter what brand I tried so that is another plus with the Depo But everyone is different and everyone will react differently
262,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41938,13,I have been on the shot for years I love it my doctor said I will have to take Xanax and Lexapro with the Depo to even out the mood swings I am fine and my moods are good it is natural that your body has bleeding and spotting I have it too but it does not bother me as much as I suffered with PMS forgetting things all the time and being bitchy Now I dont have that I FEEL GREAT Cramps yes but not as bad
263,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41930,18,I was on the DepoProvera for years It worked amazing for me Never got my period after the third shot and never got pregnant What I didnt love was that I got all the bad side effects that came along with it But dont think this is a bad birth control because I got every side effect that came with it I was just unlucky my body is different then other peoples My friend got no side effects on this birth control Just note that this is a short term birth control tho I think I was on it for too many years Im on something different now I would recommend this birth control
264,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41918,22,When I first got the shot I skipped my first period and then had really light periods after that for a few months Then my period started occurring more often About weeks of bleeding then week off then bleed for week then week off or less then bleed for weeks Really weird That occurred for a couple months Then I started bleeding non stop for awhile It was really light but who likes bleeding all the time Finally at about year of sticking it out I now am back to skipping the first period after getting the shot and sometimes skip the second or sometimes light spotting I do bleed a little heavier just before my next shot is due Makes me think its wearing of too soon Had no other side effects though
265,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41916,82,My shot ended in August and since then I have been constantly bleeding I went in and saw a doctor about this issue and they told me to take pain relievers times a day to stop the bleeding I have tried that and I am still bleeding I will never get on this shot again I have been on this shot before and never had issues like this
267,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41906,40,Im years old Im a sophomore in high school I started taking the DepoProvera shot around my freshman year It actually hasnt given me any bad side effects beside loss of hair I havent lost a lot a hair and mood swings My freshman year I weighed and now I weigh Im and havent gained a pound from this shot yet I hate shots but its definitely worth taking for having no period I havent experienced depression or any of the other side effects except the ones listed above But not everyone is the same I would recommend talking to your doctor about it before jumping into taking it
269,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,41902,53,This shot has caused me so many issues I got it only once Before the shot I had abnormally heavy periods that lasted days and to be honest Id rather go back to that My body has had so many issues The first month things were fine The only issues I had within the first month was headaches and nausea the nausea got EXTREMELY severe at times I actually had to grip onto my boyfriend just to get stable or lie on the floor Then came the second month EXCESSIVE SPOTTING I also got major depression and hated everyone I am currently on my third month of the shot and I am still spotting heavily and sometimes bleeding Due to the shot I am now anemic and facing heading to the ER but I cant because I do not have insurance
271,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41901,43,I liked this medication when I first got it but after awhile I started to get migraines dizziness hot flashes weight gain heavy bleeding and severe depression
272,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41896,88,I got DepoProvera on June at the hospital after giving birth to my daughter Today is September and I have not stopped bleeding at all I also have two friends who have the same problem This shot is terrible
273,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41889,1,Im writing this review to offer some hope when I first got the shot I read all these reviews and it freaked me out Luckily I had none of the mood swing or depression side effects but definitely still got the cramping and bleeding After my first shot I didnt bleed at all for about weeks until my regular cycle was due Started with spotting and then bled regularly for the next weeks I read some other reviews from people saying they stopped bleeding after the second shot and lo and behold one week after my second shot and I stopped bleeding completely I know I felt like I was going to bleed forever so hopefully thisll offer some hope to newcomers of the shot Especially when they say something like of women stop immediately
274,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41889,32,Ive been on Depo for year and months and first my periods would last weeks days instead of days After my rd shot I had no more periods but lately my last shots Ive been spotting due to getting my shots at the th week instead of week Ive had no complications inspite the lbs gain weight from the shot This September Im due for another but have decided with my fiance to put a hold on the shots Just remember ladies everyones body is different so what may work out for me wont on others if one birth control doesnt cut it for you try another the one that suits you best Good luck
275,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42158,26,I have been bleeding profusely clots steady bleeding for a year and a half yes months I have seen different OBGYNs I am and have fibroid tumors and ovarian cysts Both doctors have used the quottry this and seequot approach and I have been given Provera Depo Shots and Beyaz birth control None of these have stopped the bleeding After taking the Beyaz last December my blood sugar level rose to and it took a month to get it back to normal Of course now I am considered a diabetic and have to take Metformin every day despite the fact that I was not diabetic or prediabetic before then It is ridiculous that these doctors will not consider a permanent treatment option
277,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42154,17,I got the DEPO shot on December and I started bleeding on January it is now May and I have not stopped bleeding I now have Anemia due to the blood loss Do not get this shot It is terrible One thing is for sure you will not get pregnant because you will not have a sex life
278,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42154,14,I loved the idea of taking one shot and not having to deal with pills The birth control pills never worked for me they made me sick and did not prevent pregnancy Ive had shots so far the st one was great I had no period for the first month but then the second month I had heavy bleeding and what my doctor described to me as quotmy vaginal wall falling out of my bodyquot it was horrifying I will spear you the details but needles to say it scared the crap out of me I continued with my shots listening to my doctor she told me that my body just had to get used to the shot Im due for a shot next week and Ive decided to go wo the shot has caused me mood swings bleeding uncontrollably etc no more depo Its horrible
279,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42153,11,I started the depo provera on June this was going to be my first time on birth control and I thought this would be a easy way not having to worry about taking a pill daily and I heard eventually it will stop your period to begin with Boy was I ever wrong when I started the depo I got the shot while I was on my period so it ended like it was suppose to be the next month July my period came early and it did not stop till September It was the WORST choice Ive ever made My whole summer was ruined because my period was so heavy I went through depression which I never have before I did not get another shot Im glad I made the choice to stop now over a year later my body is back to normal thank god
281,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42151,13,I was on this medication for years and in this time I did not experience any side effects maybe a little weight gain but nothing drastic I went from giving birth to the needle straight away and never had a period spotting or anything For me it worked but I know some who it didnt work for so my suggestion is try it if its not for you then stop what do you have to lose
282,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42151,13,I started the shot around Feb and went in to the clinic not knowing what I wanted I decided on the shot there and then but then read more reviews after I got it that freaked me out depression loss of sexdrive anxiety etc Im pretty moody as it is so I was terrified of what I had put in my body I did bleed and spot for about weeks after which I think is totally normal because that has happened to me in starting any new birth control pill amp patch Then I started to realize that my body was taking really well to it I never noticed any major mood swings aside from the emotional being I already am know yourself Got the second shot amp still going good Im sure there are longterm effects though that could be considered
283,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42151,14,Ive been on depo since I was years old I am now years old I first got on depo because I had really bad cyst on my ovaries and breast With depo it has controlled the pain and size of cyst Ive gained maybe pounds since Ive been in this No bleeding no spotting what so ever I do get lower cramping once in awhile but it is tolerable I also do not plan on having kiddos so this was the best choice for me
284,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42150,8,Had to get an abortion just over a month ago Wanted to use a different birth control because I started getting very sick after years of taking the pill Depo seemed to be working fine for the first couple weeks Then all the sudden I notice I am angry at almost everything The next minute severely depressed Yelling at my significant other for no reason I already had mood swings before and now its horrifying Ive gained weight and feel awful about it I just got my first spotting last week Ill bleed a lot Then a little Just waiting for it to end Bad cramps everyday I knew I shouldnt have tried this method but the pill makes me sick to my stomach Not doing depo again have to figure out something else Again
285,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42149,17,Worsed birth control ever I got it jan its April today still bleeding two months now straight every day all day first it was brown and black color no cramp Then last week I had very bad cramps and passed a blood clot the size of a golf ball now I have bad cramps and bright red blood tired all the time hemoglobin at Im due for the second shot first week of may I will never do this to my body again Everyone in my house is suffering my husdan kids and myself
286,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42149,5,Have had the shot three times now after switching from the pill to the depo due to cysts and this was supposed to help stop them Ive had no pregenancy scares but severe bleeding for four months now and black blood weight gain like crazy and breast pain everyday it works well for birth control but the side effects are not worth it
287,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42148,17,Worst decision ever Got depo shot after wks postpartum thinking it was the most convenient birth control method Oh so wrong Got it started bleeding a month after I am still bleeding Limited sex due to period bleeding its not pretty Terrible mood swings Increased cravings for sweets and junk food dizziness very tired and sleepy Well its a horror story I am not going back for a nd shot no way I will never get another shot of this medicine that transformed me in to a non stop bleeding witch
288,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42148,13,I was on Depo from the ages of with absolutely NO problems NO bleeding it stopped my periods completely NO side effects I went back on the depo August currently ages and have been getting the shots every months on the first date they are due I have been spottingbleeding almost the whole time When I have sex it seems to make me bleed more Everything has been ruled out and its just been blamed as a side effect of the Depo from my doctor I also managed to get pregnant and have a miscarriage while on the shoton time with each due date The longer I am on this the more side effects I am starting to get acne SEVERE depression anxiety and mood swings I recommend for younger only
289,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42147,15,I recently got the deposit shot March th for the very first time And for the rest of the month I didnt have an sign of a cycle Come April th Ive been spotting ever since I even went to the Dr at the end of April to get estrogen pills to stop the bleeding and it stops bit as soon as you stop taking the pills it starts right back spotting again which I stopped taking because it caused a yeast infection so then I had to get med for that Here it is the end of May and Im still bleeding And come June Im scheduled for the nd shot There is NO WAY Im ever getting this again Can someone tell me when does this ever stop I even started reading up on natural ways such as herbal stores to help stop the bleeding What helps
291,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42145,23,Why would u make such a awful drug plz discontinue this stuff I know how it stops you getting pregnant you bleed every freaking day so who would have sex with you no one I wanted to take the time out of my day to say this medicine sucks and I hate it Ive gotten only shots and Ive been bleeding for weeks I just wanted to let u know that Thanks for nothing
293,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42142,6,I was never into birth control so I have kids My oldest years old I tried depo shot after I gave birth in November to my th baby all natural vaginal births no epidural This was my first time it was the shot on the booty and arm I have had nothing but aniexty no its not my kids i never felt this way before and I gained ton of weight more than I usually do after a baby I weigh I usually get down months after I give birth Ive been bleeding nonstop I decided I didnt like the shot Im getting tons of mood swings more than the ones that I get from pregnancy Im just going to tie my tubes Its a nightmare Its May now so from November to May Ive been bleeding I went to check my hemoglobin its fine its just depressing
294,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42141,11,Im just finishing up my first month on the shot and I can honestly say that its working well This is my first birth control Ive had and there have only been a couple of side effects I spotted for about days twice within the first months which isnt bad But I also experienced some vaginal dryness that required additional foreplay as well as lube at times Overall I think its fine considering I dont have to remember it and the spotting I heard gets better over time Im due for my next shot in a couple of weeks after which Ill offer another review So this isnt a bad choice but with any birth control there are side effects
295,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42140,9,I was on the shot for yrs straight about yrs ago I absolutely loved it and I would have recommended it any of my girlfriends I didnt have one period and no cramping for yrs Loved it Not even weeks after missing my last shot I became pregnant My daughter was born in and about months ago I started the shot again Worst decision of my life I have not stopped spotting Every damn day for almost months and Im starting to get really crampy and Ive have terrible migraines Ive been having mood swings and Ive never experienced anxiety so bad in my life I would seriously consider looking into the side effects and reading up on the shot before you get it
297,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42138,11,Well I had my first months shot on th January and two days after it I started bleeding I have never stopped and the date today is th of may Quite depressing since it was my first time taking contraception I had all the possible side effect to be honest Hot flashes at night terrible migraines severe back ache fatigue tiredness name it There was a point i went to doctors everyday but now I got used to feeling ill which is quite sad So you are taking a risk using DepoProvera
298,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42137,37,I am yrs old Since the birth of my first child Ive had very heavy painful periods Often irregular as in a couple times a month But I have been bleeding for almost months now Three months ago I was put on Provera mg once a day It lightened my bleeding after a few days then I had brown discharge for a few days But I started bleeding again even while taking the Provera I first had a day supply then a day supply another weeks and now more But it has changed nothing Im bleeding and cramping nonstop and still have no answers No fibroids polyps or cysts
299,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42136,4,Had the shot two years ago and loved it no periods no sure effects I stopped it for a while and got another shot weeks ago Severe mood swings painful acne sore breasts period pain and migrains Spotting non stop for weeks Will never take the shot again
301,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42054,73,Ive been taking this shot since October Ive been bleeding non stop since December It went from a weeks period to a month period Ive taken Meds to help amp nothing This horrible Its like Im on the shot for no reason
302,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,42049,9,I was pretty terrified to try it out hearing amp seeing all these bad reviews I got my first shot in November around the time my period was ending So far that was my last period The first month I did get a little bit of cramping which I usually dont get I havent had any cramping since then amp also by the time I was due for my second period I spotted instead for maybe days my periods usually last days amp it seemed like it was more like discharge than it did spotting Again thats been it no more periods so far nor spotting As for gain weight I may have gained a few pounds honestly not sure I never step on a scale But nothing drastic I just recently got my second Depo on February th well see if all goes well
304,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42034,33,Have been on DepoProvera almost years since being diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis as it is the only contraceptive my consultant could recommend that doesnt allow ovulation I can honestly say I find no faults with this contraceptive I get it every weeks as apposed to every weeks to keep it built up and not allow bleeding I was on the pill version before and it didnt agree with me but the injection has worked wonders No pain nausea anemia or bleeding My life has changed because of this medication I would honestly seek professional advice if you found this didnt work for you as it may just be a case of dosage or time span
305,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42030,20,I have been on Depo for years Its effective No kids I started seeing side effects around year which included a little facial hair Around year I gained about pounds I went from to about its still so worth it No periods and no cramps after year I take calcium supplements and I lift heavy weights so along with getting bone density testso far so good
306,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42029,9,I was on DepoProvera for a few years with one break to try the Nuvaring just because of the bone density loss warnings I had no weight gain or bleeding or hormone swings just some occasional crazy night sweats Then I had my first baby in May and started Depo in June It has not been the same experience My bleeding is irregular and lasts days to weeks and this month has hit me every other week It is January and I quit It just isnt working for me this time around
312,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42011,11,Effective and not disappointed After the first weeks on the shot I had heavy period for almost days but after that absolutely no period no cramping spotting nothing Some weight gain but Im successfully burning that off The only downside is the depression and anxiety but those are occasional They only happen within the first couple weeks of taking the shot and I just got my third dose Love it but its not for everybody
313,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42010,67,Ive been on the shot for about a year and months and ama Still having my period irregularly and it will last about weeksb Am on my period now and have been on it so far for weeks
314,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42008,19,I got my first Depo shot November th Since then I only had minor spotting and cramps no mood swings or major weight gain if anything my weight is far more stable and satisfactory Although on the nd of January I began my normal period again and hoping it will end on the th Definitely would recommend
315,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42006,47,Everyone I talk to seems to have had different experiences with Depo For me it has been a perfect experience but my sister had a horrible time with it I had very light spotting after the first shot during what should have been my monthly period and since then have had absolutely no period or spotting My weight has remained at a constant level the entire years that Ive been taking it and I havent experience moods swings hair loss or any of the other common symptoms My doctor warned me that the shot could make my migraines worse but I havent noticed any difference in prevalence or severity Everyones body reacts differently but it is definitely worth trying I love this form of contraception no periods and no babies
316,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42000,96,I got one shot September its now almost January and I havent stopped bleeding in over a year
318,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41997,63,I have been receiving the Depo shot since July This has been my first and only birth control Ive taken and a huge benefit is that I am not worrying about taking a pill However for the past months I have experienced spotting It is not enough blood to need to wear a tampon however it is very dark blood which stains underwear This has been extremely frustrating to me and I am now trying to decide what will be my next best option of birth control will be
319,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41994,27,Im due for my second shot next week Im very torn about getting it When I got the shot I didnt have any side effects at first Every month since the shot I bleed for about weeks straight It really bothers me One of the main reasons I got on it was to try to help my periods Just makes them worse
321,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41991,37,Ive just gotten the second shot today and I must say I love it havent had my period had the tiniest bit of spotting I still get cramps when Im due for my period but nothing else I have also not gotten pregnant at all Probably the best decision I ever made
324,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41978,17,Ive been on the shot for years no cycle no other children and no weight gain The only side effects that I think Im having now is low sex drive because I cant get into sex like I used too I dont like taking pills and forget to with vitamins so I know they wouldnt be a good idea But I do think being on the shot for so long actually messed with the hormones because my face tends to break out every other week but other than that I love it but its time to get off
325,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41483,20,I got the DepoProvera when I got the intrauterine device taken out Ive only had the Depo for three weeks but Ive been bleeding everyday and because of being injected with hormones my mood has been awful Ive practically broke up with me boyfriend so now it seems Ive got the Depo for no reason
326,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41472,16,I had the best experience with the DepoProvera I first went on it Jan I have had absolutely no periods since then I did gain some weight about pounds but have been able to lose it with proper diet and exercise I should point out I frequently eat fast food and frozen pizzas so that Im willing to bet thats the reason I gained weight and the Depo had very little to do with it The shots werent that bad and having to only get it every three months was very nice I was on DepoProvera for about years and loved every minute of it but every doctor I went to said that DepoProvera isnt supposed to be long term and that I need to consider a different form of Birth Control I will try Nexplanon and if I dont like it Im going back on DepoProvera
329,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,41455,50,I got on the shot in April for many reasons I worked at the YMCA in the pool amp I didnt want to worry about bleeding My cramps were torture I wouldnt be able to get out of bed During the first month or so I did spot and have some cramps but they eventually stopped I love the shot I did gain some weight but that was some what my fault because I stayed unactive But with a good diet and some exercise you wont gain weight Recommend it to everyone
330,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41455,13,Been on this birth control for yrs now and have had no problems No period just very light spotting month before next shot due
332,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41450,13,Im years old and have been using DepoProvera for a year and a half and I love it I hope I never go back to the pill I did gain about pounds the first year but Im not sure I can blame that completely on the shot I was able to the extra weight within weeks of dietexercise I rarely have a period and even then its light and barely noticeable Never heavy bleeding like a normal period and that is awesome I get my shot in the arm and it never hurts or leaves my arm sore I also take calcium and vitamin C supplements to prevent bone density loss
333,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41447,17,Ive been on the DepoProvrea shot for about months now and I was absolutely terrified of gaining weight on it because of the multiples stories Ive heard But I actually lost weight so I love it I havent noticed any change in mood Perhaps a slight increase in acne but hardly anything to complain about I did have spotting for about weeks in the beginning Overall I really like it I dont have to take a pill every day and there arent really any noticeable side effects
334,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41446,11,Love this medication I suffered with painful periods and ovulation and terrible mood swings which all got worse after having my kids I tried various birth control pills but without a great improvement especially with mood I just had my third shot I only gained lbs since the first shot and I no longer have a period Ive had some slight acne but happy to manage that overall for me its been great Very happy I should add that I am taking calcium and Vitamin D also
336,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41432,10,I started on the Depo shot right before I entered college and it has been the best experience ever mainly because I dont have any more periods For the first months I had lighter and shorter periods without the awful cramps And now after being on it for almost years I havent had a period in a year and a half I only went on birth control because I was scared of getting pregnant in college but I would truly recommend this to anyone who is fed up dealing with period cramps and other inconveniences Also for any other college students most universities will only charge for the shot and injection but since I already had the prescription from my doctor and my insurance they only charged me for the lab injection
337,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41424,101,Im years old I never been on any other birth control but the months on DepoProveraI bled for months as well as depression I was PMSing the full months Caused problems in my relationship because of it
338,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41423,8,Ive been on the Depo shot for a year now and the only problems Id faced were the headaches nausea and mood swings Its Great not having a cycle Im opting to try another method but the shot seems most effective Although everyones Experience is different mine was Okay
339,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41418,11,Ive been on Depo for two years st year was rocky with the spotting and mood swings nd year was great Still not pregnant no more side effects I take my vitamin C and D Ive gained lbs no difference Ive tried the pill and patch and hated them equally for different reason I would hate to have to switch birth control I love shots and no babies Its great for me Good luck with your experience
340,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41409,10,Depo was fantastic at doing what it was intended to do control birth However I was on this for years and gained at least pounds I was also bipolar and cried over everything On the plus side I only had my period times a year right around the time of my next injection
341,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41408,7,Im with two kids and I always had regular periods I was on the pill for many years and decided to try the Depo shot I had some spotting but my period completely stopped after the nd shot It was very nice not having a period and taking a pill every day I didnt start gaining weight until the nd shot and I felt hungry all the time Ive always been a small person and maintained my weight without diet even having kids I had Depo shots total and went back on the pill because my weight kept going up I gained lbs and havent been able to get rid of it since
342,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41406,13,Ive been on the Depo shot before and other than slight maybe lb weight gain and slight mood changes I had no problems with it I was off of it for about months and just got back on it and in one week have gained lbs and get skin rashes pretty consistently now My mood is ridiculous I cry like every day sometimes out of happiness other times out of sadness
343,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41405,10,Im and was on the shot for months Before I was on the pill but didnt like the side affects and remembering to take it everyday The first month on the shot was great Then slowly things went downhill and got bad I was getting acne on my back which I never got before and was really insecure about and my periods were getting longer I decided to get the second shot because I knew my body had to get used to the hormones Then I got very intense cramps that would wake me up in the night and make me feel sick My period would last weeks Before I had a very light and short period and light cramps These new changes are too much for me so didnt get the third shot Going to try the patch
344,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41404,10,I have been on the Depo shot for years I have always loved this type of birth control First year period was unpredictable But ever since wonderful not having one About ten years ago I read in a magazine about the Depo causing problems with bones while sitting in doctors office to get my shot I asked the nurse about it and she advised me to get a bone density test which I did The doctor called me when he got the results and asked why I would take such a test and was not happy that I did So I keep it with my records and kind of forgot about it Went in this month to get my shot and the doctor informed me that this would be the last shot he gives me that he is going to refuse any future shot Not Happy Loved Shot
347,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41388,21,I am and Since I first received the shot in January I have been bleeding ever since Sometimes light sometimes like an actual period with cramps and migrainesAlso this medicine has completely jacked up my hormones I am angry ALL the time ALWAYS sad I cry everyday over the smallest issues or for no reason I am happy and in a split second I will feel very low or even have suicidal thoughts I experience extreme mood swings and flip out on my boyfriend coupled with less sex from the bleeding Its very frustrating I am hoping that this is just my body still adjusting to the medicine I havent had any weight gain or acne though knock on wood
348,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41382,53,I love the Depo shot No side effects at all I read so many negative reviews before I took my first shot I have experienced none of the side effects I read about in the reviews I have not had any break through bleeding as many people described I have had no periods after the first shot Before Depo I had painful cramps before and during my period No pain and no weight gain I am so pleased with this form of birth control
349,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,41368,56,I started my Depo shot around September a week or two before I was about to get my next shot I started my period I thought when I received my next shot it might stop it It didnt I am still on my period and it is April I have my next shot today and this is my last attempt if it continues I will be switching back to the pill Not only that but I had major weight gain and depression
350,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42120,5,Ive been on the shot for a while Started it after a miscarriage with DampC procedure I havent had a period no weight gain like people are scared of and no bad side effects Im pleased The pills and patch caused nothing but problems
351,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42119,4,I was given a depo provera shot after an essure procedure I had never taken it before I had non stop bleeding for months until my doctor gave me another birth control to take on top of it The bleeding stopped for a couple weeks but came back and has not stopped for a month and a half Definite weight gain This drug should only be used to treat specific conditions and not be used as a general birth control
352,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42119,19,I was on the depo a little over a year ago had no problems nor period the whole time This year I returned back to the depo feb and have been bleeding for months straight The Depo is terrible NEVER AGAIN
353,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42119,16,I only had shots then stopped but about months after stopping I started having constant bleeding and its been nonstop for almost months and for me its way more of a hassle than its worth
354,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42118,20,Ive been on this shot for a little more than a year and at first it was fine but about halfway through my year I began having random periods of spotting I noticed it usually began after and sometimes DURING sex I havent gained much weight or anything but bleeding during sex is NOT fun I would recommend this form of birth control but something must be done about the irregular bleeding
356,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42113,12,DepoProvera is the best birth control I have ever experienced I have had NONE of the said side effects No weight gain no bleeding whatsoever and no uncomfortable side effects It is easy to remember only having to go in every months I highly recommend this form of birth control Great experience
357,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,42110,61,Hello everyone I just wanted to give a recent review in provera Before I started provera tablets my issue was I didnt have a period for months and I didnt understand why My doctor tested my hormones and everything came back normal I was so frustrated and confused because I didnt understand why my period had stopped My boyfriend and I are trying for our third child so not having a period was a big problem Finally my doctor prescribed me provera pill for days After days post taking the pill my period finally come yayyyyy I was so nervous because reading the reviews had me feeling like the provera wasnt going to work So I would recommend this medicine for anybody that have irregular periods or if your periods stop
359,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,42108,10,Ive been on the DepoProvera shot for over months now I received my first shortly after I had my son I was breastfeeding so this was my only option The only pros for me are its convenient Im a nurse and I just pick it up from pharmacy and inject myself or a friend from work does it for me then Im good for three months no remembering to take a pill Cons have been constant bleeding on and off longest being over weeks straight I have gained back all the weight that I did lose from having my baby and am now stuck at the same weight I was at months pregnant its awful and embarrassing I am constantly hungry like constantly and I crave sweets and chocolate more than anything I also am sweating like crazy all the time
361,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42106,15,Ive been on depo for almost a year now Its had its ups and down Ups would be not having periods no babies and unprotected sex Downs would be the redbrown spotting weight gain and back pain what Im experiencing at the moment The weight thing is a little weird I usually weigh around and I gained about pounds and recently lost them from going to the gym and eating less fast foods Overall its the best BC method Keep in mind all that I described doesnt happen to all women we all vary
362,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42103,15,This shot has saved my life I was very hormonal with terrible painful PMS This shot helped with all of my symptomsincluding my constant back pain I dont really think the weight gain is a big issue because I know I gained pounds around my period anyways I have energy to do more important things now and it has helped my depression significantly It may not be for everyone but it definitely is helping me tremendously
363,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42103,6,Ive been on it for months now The only bad thing is depending on your body type youll gain a lot of weight I gained poundsyet it definitely filled in my small bodyI dont have a period any more but I always look and feel pregnant But it very effective as a birth control I highly recommend it and its easy to keep up with
364,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,42103,9,I was diagnosed with stage endometriosis at years old After being on Lupron for months my doctor proceeded to put me on Depo for the rest of my life until I decide to have kids and then back on the shot afterwards I am now on my th shot and Ive had horrible endometriosis painnot cramps very different pain and have had my period for weeks I am not sure the Depo is working correctly with my body but other than that the previous shots have made almost all pain from my endometriosis go away
365,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42102,7,I got my first dose Feb th I cramped for about weeks I started to spot around March Ive been bleeding heavy on and off Since March to present Its horrible I have serious mood swings My face has broken out badly And Im always tired and constantly eating My body feels weak maybe due to lose of to much blood I wont be getting my second dose in May
366,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42101,11,I was on depo for and a half years it worked wonders for me I had awful periods before the shot After the first shot I had a light period for about weeks but no period or spotting ever after that I did not gain weight I actually lost weight It does make you hungry ALL the time for the first few months but I was wise about my snack choices with I believe helped alot This was the only form of BC me and my boyfriend used for the entire time and no babies It does take some getting used to not having a period to confirm you arent pregnant at first When we decided to have a baby it took months to get pregnant I didnt have any serious issues and loved it
369,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,42099,8,I started my first injection over a month ago for my severe endometriosis The day after I started noticing terrible mood swings as did my family I would get angry and freak out at the tiniest things Usually cry over nothing It lasted for about weeks and my moods have simmered down but not as much as they should He said to consider Zoloft because my hormone levels arent normal and I have anxiety I have been spotting everyday for the whole month and still notice some pain but not as bad as it was before I started the injections My obg said this was normal and assured me after the third injection this would go away Hopefully it does I can now say Im not living in hell times a year
371,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42096,25,I got this shot in January after having my son ever since then I havent stopped bleeding Im certainly thinking of taking the pill better I guess my body isnt working with this shot But it is very effective
372,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42094,12,Ive been on Depo for almost years now Bled spotted nonstop for the first months and a little after that The side effects normalized after a full months Initially I gained weight by only on the first few months When its close to being time for my next injection I get PMS symptoms and every now and then I get quotunusualquot unusual for me side effects with an injection but it usually is only for months and goes back to normal with the next one I do however experience spotting bleeding after sex sometimes Ive heard it can be from cervical capillaries that are made more sensitive from the drug but I dont know that theres firm research on it
373,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42092,9,I have been on the depo shot since I had my daughter which was years ago For the first few months I had spotting but that stopped I still get PMSlike symptoms around the time I would usually get my period I have gained pounds while on depo I have been getting bad migranes amp terrible aches in my body and Im not sure if its because of the shot I would definitely recommend this shot There is nothing to remember every day just show up to the doctor once every months
376,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42208,4,I had a great experience on this medicine I recently stopped because I got sick of the spotting What makes me mad is as soon as I stopped my body had finally got used to it I was a pretty fit person too I am and I weight about when starting and then dropped down to Its very very rare to lose weight so dont think it will happen to you but I went to the gym in my spare time I mainly ran a lot and I lost the weight It was great and I never had to worry about being pregnant I plan to go back on this bc again Plus it was free I have tried plenty of bc and cant stand the pills tried the nuvaring because that was free with my insurance too Nope hated it Everyone is different but overall this was the best BC I was on
378,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42204,6,Hello everyone I was years old when I started the depo I finally got off the depo at then turned around and got the year IUD at the age Now Im years old turning in July I never been pregnant never had no abortion Now I want a child and cant even get pregnant I just dont know what to do If you know any fertility pills let me know please
379,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometrial Hyperplasia Prophylaxis,9,42203,4,I am yo I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and always have been very irregular with my periods to the point of going for to months with not even a drop of blood recently my doctor found abnormal cells in my uterus lining he prescribed medroxiprogesterone for months pill daily Am done with the treatment now and during the months I got my period times only but in overall I felt fine no major side effects I only felt it a little dizziness and a few headaches I also put on some weight but with exercise I have managed I feel great and cant wait to see the results of my next biopsy
382,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,3,42201,13,I took Provera pills daily to stop my periods to kill the monthly pain I chose pills over the shot so I could have control of deciding whenif I wanted to stop I took the pills for months The first month I had lots of breakthrough bleeding basically I was slowly bleeding for a few weeks After that I had no period no spotting no cramps that part was FANTASTIC However for me the side effects were severe and unlivable I had insomnia waking in the night every night I had night sweats every night I gained a little weight I had extreme vaginal drynesspainful intercourse which was a first ever for me My sex drive was nonexistent and my acne and facial hair PCOS got much worse
383,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,42201,26,Ive been taking Depo for about years and its never given me any negative symptoms I went on it very young because I had painful abnormal periods I havent had any menstral cycles the whole time which means no pain Ive never struggled with weight gain My bones are healthy and strong in fact Ive never had a broken bone in my entire life Its highly effective as a birth control and I am very happy with it
384,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42199,6,I find the depo really good as im still on it Ive been on it since November and havnt had my period since no weight gain besides maybe pounds not bad at all seeing im only lbs and havnt had any other side effects I find its very effective and happy i dont have to worry about ruining more underwear
385,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42199,4,I first had this shot in I had two but felt sick all the time my periods did stop though Came off it and went back on the pill didnt have a period for a year and a half In I decided to give it another go soon settled down and didnt have any periods at all stayed on it for years It was fabulous no periods or spotting But I was suffering from depression which is a side effect of depo I decided to come off it Started my first period after about days and it lasted about a month and it stank Had about a weeks break and then bleeding again thick dark brown clots In the end I gave up and went back on it after injections still having random spotting lasting random amounts of time Just hope it settles down again
389,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42194,11,I love the depo shot Ive been on it for over two years now I have had no period or spotting until about two years on it I only spot about weeks before my next shot and have had a little bleeding lately Other than that I really love it And no weight gain
390,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42193,4,I got this shot bc of a pregnancy scare and its only been a week but Ive had non stop brown spotting I read about the pill and it said no extreme things But now Im reading reviews and Im totally freaked out and now I cant get out of it The whole point was so I could have sex with no worries but now I dont have sex bc it would be nasty So dont do what I did pay attention to negative reviews
391,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42193,32,This shot has temporarily ruined my life I am close to my month mark of this shot which means another dose I am strongly considering not getting another I am currently typing this at am because I woke up after bleeding through my pad Not fun Ive been bleedingspotting for over half of the months I am always bloated tired and emotional Sex drive gone not to mention the constant inserting and deserting of tampons dozens of times a day The only thing i ever see is blood Im constantly tired i dont have the drive to do anything This shot has consumed my life
392,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42192,10,The amount of characters I can type is limited but my story is long so Ill shorten it for you Ive almost had the injection for a full year I have also almost had my period for a full year August will be the anniversary and also when I give up on this birth control Not spotting a full on period Upon receiving my last shot the technician severed a nerve Ive never had a good experience with the administration of this injection If I do not strictly work out based on how much I eat every single day I begin to gain immediately I also have extreme very extreme body odor vaginal oral the worst is under my arms It also completely ruined my libido From start to finish the experience has been nothing but awful
393,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42192,5,I started this shot in order to stop my already heavy flow and it did the complete opposite Every time that I take the shot I am period free for a week and then after that months of constant bleeding It was the worst idea ever Thank goodness that I did not go with the arm implant I bet that I would have been bleeding for years straight no breaks
394,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42192,11,I was on the depo for about a year everything was perfect Then I had stopped taking birth control went back on the patch then I had to go back on the shot Now Im due for my third shot and Ive been bleeding for two weeks Every time I think its done I become active with my partner and it all starts coming out again He and I have been together for a year and a half so the only good thing about it right now is that Im not pregnant
402,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41794,70,Ive been on DepoProvera for years this month It was great Had little to no periods light spotting for a week before I had gotten my next shot Didnt have to worry about taking pills daily I had no side effects at all I was actually losing weight But the last shot I had back in March they informed me that there was a new type of Depo formula that took place of the Depo that my body was used to Ever since then my period has been not stopped I gained pounds in one week of water weight My cramps has been terrible to where I cant eat I feel as though Im pregnant at all times I go Tuesday to either get checked to see if I need to be off it Anyone else experienced this since theyve changed it
403,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41793,21,Ive been on Depo for months now its almost time to get my third shot After my very first shot I had no bleeding at all for two months just random cramps that were kind of annoying Then at the third month I spotted very lightly for a week then bled normal for about a week then bled really really heavy for a few days Then it stopped and I got my second shot Two and a half months with no bleeding after the second one then spotted lightly for over a week and no heavy bleeding It seems to get better so I cant wait for the bleeding to stop completely Also the only other side effect I have noticed is increased nervousnessanxiety I have had a few anxiety attacks at night and I thought I was having a heart attack but it was nothing
405,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,8,41789,98,Didnt have a period for years was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and hypothyroidism As hubby and I have been trying to conceive not having any periods has been difficult to judge any ovulation Was put on Provera to induce a period before doctor prescribes any ovulation mediciness Took Provera for days didnt have any side effects But after I stopped I felt nauseous breasts were very sensitive was over emotionalvery irritable and a bit dizzy at times Had light spotting on day and after stopping Provera then period starting on day Day and were lightmedium but then afterwards was extremely heavy for days with really bad cramping
406,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41788,4,I had this Depo for two years and as much as it was easier with no pill no period etc it ended up the worst thing Ive ever had I have developed cystic acne hard nodular lumps under my skin which have left me depressed with how they look They were awful and my hair was shedding rapidly I went to the doctor and came off it he put me on Dianette and advised to take it the first day I come on months in and no proper period One weekend I suffered severe and I must emphasize severe pain and cramping I could not move and was having very dark blood clots To this day my skin is still awful I am now on lymecyline and the doctors told me to use the Dianette contraceptive for my skin anyway I have never ever had skin problems previous to this
408,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41770,13,So I started this because Im terrible with rememebering to take the pill daily I absolutely LOVED the fact that I only had to go in every months to get it done The shot was very minor with little to no pain For the first three months it was heavenly I had no side effects and no period what so ever But the road after that was hell I gained a total of pounds in months due to the fact that I was hungry all the time I was very moody and depressed also Not only that but I basically lost all my sex drive and the majority of the time on the shot I spotted and when I wasnt spotting I was on my period
410,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41768,15,I am years old and have been on DepoProvera for around years I have very little side effects amp absolutely love not worrying about pregnancy or periods I cant imagine going back to having a monthly period I am very content with my light spotting every three months a week before my next shot I never plan on having children so I have no problem staying on this longterm Ive been losinggaining pounds on and off many years before I started Depo and considering I do not exercise I cannot blame any weight gain on this My only concern is bone density loss I eat calcium rich vegetables daily amp take vitamin D but may start calcium supplementation as well depending on my results from a bone density screening
411,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41766,71,I was bleeding for weeks lightly and then all of a sudden it came and I was passing large clots and a lot of blood My doctor put me on Provera mg twice a day I had a horrible headache and felt tired but my period did stop which is great
412,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41759,19,I have been on Depo since last August shots I love it I had two pill pregnancies so obviously I had to get on something that I didnt have to worry about remembering In the first months I did have some bleeding issues I would spot for weeks at a time but I havent had a period in a long time I havent experienced any of the other side effects either I love it and I recommend it all the time
413,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41754,21,Ive been on the shot for about two years now and Ive only spotted a few times here and there I did gain almost pounds though I do like not having to worry about a regular period though and I used to have slightly heavy periods to I would say its been more positive then negative
414,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41749,13,Im years old and I have been on the shot since July I havent had any of the side effects like having unusual cramps headaches or ance The only problem that I have is I spot on and off for about weeks right before Im supposed to get my next shot
415,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41746,1,Just recently have got Depo subQ provera for the first timeat the same time my best friend has gotten the regular DepoProvera shotI havent had any side effects no mood swings no weight gaining nothing While shes had some mood swings going on I dont know if its because its a different Depo or just because Im a different person but Id recommend this to people Plus its a much smaller needle that goes in your stomach instead of your arm
416,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41741,42,My experience with Provera has been a very painful situation I am and was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome at the age of I never had regular periods since the age of I was always on some form of birth control to regulate I was taking the DepoPovera shot depo shot for about months before I decided to get off due to the excessive weight gain The Nurse Practitioner weaned me off of the shot and decided to give me the Micronor birth control pills which did not help as well I have been on my cycle for months I can ot afford insurancethe only thing I could do was to go to the emergency room I seen the ER dr there where she gave me the Provera mg four times a day My bleeding has gotten heavier
417,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41735,21,Ive been on the Depo for about months so shots Ive never had bleeding until this past week a full week straight Never had a period until now Never even had any period pain or anything close to it I love the low maintenance associated with the shot but if this continues I may have to stop
419,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41729,19,Had it for a year and a bit Gained weight Stopped it months ago and get my period twice a month Painful ones too
420,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,6,41726,14,It does what its supposed to at least for me it did Im prescribed to take days of mg Provera every night before bed every days or every two months I dont have a cycle It makes me feel awful though The first month I was prescribed Provera I took all pills Im on the smaller side and I really think mg is just too much for my body I have horrific constipation amp gas after about days on it absolutely zero energy and my face tends to breakout only small its always clear otherwise it also makes me starving It works though
422,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,41722,40,Ive only had one shot so far but it has now been almost two months since I got the shot I heard good things about this shot and I was hoping it would take care of my really severe cramps I skipped my period the month after I got the shot but then the month after that it came back I would say my period is a lot lighter now but it has lasted twice as long as it normally does My cramps have been better as they are now tolerable But they are still there I have noticed a really big change in mood swings and emotions I get in cranky moods WAY more often At least once a day I also have noticed that I cry super easily now even over little things Again though it has only been two months Maybe things will start to get better
424,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41718,10,Ive never had acne and I cannot seem to get rid of it Im sure its because of the Depo Provera as it started shortly after my first injection I am in my s and an active runner My hips and knees seem to be much more sore after runs after I started the Depo I also have osteoporosis in my family and that is not helping my bone density situation On the positive side its easy to take stops my periods and I lost weight on it All that being said this will be my last cycle as the convenience is not worth brittle bones or a face full of acne
425,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41588,14,Ive been on the Depo for about months now and am happy to say I will not be getting another shot I received my first shot days after giving birth I have not had a period besides the constant bleeding for weeks after delivering but do get get brown discharge instead which doesnt bother me The only thing I HATED was the weight gain I gained about lbs after every shot And its been VERY hard to get rid of I also have no sex drive But besides that I havent expierenced any other side effects
426,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41586,24,I started the depo shot in January due to my extremely heavy periods It had gotten to the point where I was missing school a few days every month and just laying in bed because my menstrual cycle was so bad I decided to try out the depo shot Ive been on it a year and have just recently had spotting in between my shots Depo shot has helped so much I no longer have periods except for the occasional spotting and I feel SO much better Granted I do get the occasional migraine spotting and cramps Id say the shot is definitely worth it
430,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41583,11,Ive been on the Depo shot for about months I decided along with my doctor to get the Shot because i have what is called bacterial vaginosis cysts on my ovaries and also constant yeast infections It has seemed to help with all of the above reasons of why I initially started the shot On the shot i have experienced horrific migraines nausea extreme mood swing severe depression and high levels of anxiety I also spot monthly and for the first two months i bled heavily I am actually going back to the doctor to switch to either a different birth control or to completely get off of BC I hope this helps yall
432,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41579,4,I started the birth control shot in the day before my th birthday To say the least it was a terrible decision The shot was great in some ways I did not have a period the entire time I was on the shot months and through my st month on the pill after My periods were always irregular though It was also nice to be free from worry about contraceptionThe bad overwhelmed the good though The first week that I was on the shot I had bad headaches Not migraines but they were painful I spotted lightly halfway through the st month and continued for weeks At weeks I became horrifyingly depressed I wouldnt have survived if I hadnt known that it would likely be better once I stopped the shot
433,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41578,8,I have been on depo for over a year now My positives would be no period easy and thats about it However I will no longer be receiving this birth control Did you know that this same drug is used as a quotchemical castrationquot for male sex offenders They give it to them to drastically decrease their sex drive Makes you wonder what it does to women For me it has done just that I started receiving the shot right before my husband and I got married and I didnt even want to have sex on our honeymoon It has seriously affected our relationship and that is why I do not want to continue the shot
435,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41567,7,I have been on the depo shot since I was years now I love the shot I have never had an issue after my first couple weeks on it I never got a period again unless I missed a shot and had to wait for a period to get it again I swear by it one of the greatest thing you dont forget to take it daily no cramps no period nothing up your private area Until this past year issues I have been having all added up and led to this shot Im years old and have osteoporosis that of an year old the smaller of my breast became sizes larger my migraines increased to weekly with vision loss itchy sore breasts random stomach pains and nausea Also I have not changed my eating habits or daily routine I have out on lbs in the past mon
436,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41562,18,Ive been on DepoProvera for about weeks now As for my period its been amazing I havent gotten my period once and Ive gotten spotting once and it last around seconds Unfortunetly about once a week I get excruciating migraines to the point where I cant see Also I am having such bad hair loss Im starting to get worried Im also finding some foods I love are making me nauseous and Ive became slightly claustrophobic The worst of all though are my constant mood swings I am constantly mad over nothing at my boyfriend Almost every other day I seem to get really mad out of no where Its like Im not myself Depression isnt really an issue but it comes with my mood swings I also have no sex drive whatsoever
437,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41562,9,I have been on DepoProvera for about weeks Started spotting a pink color Then my period came a week late Ive been bleeding over a week as of now Next shot isnt until next month Cramps used to be severe but now I barely feel them Appetite has changed Mood swings all the time and constantly feel nauseous
438,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41560,82,I have been on Depo now for over years I should be paid to be their poster child It was the miracle medicine for me and my body After horrific years of monthly hell I started Depo Immediately the periods went away my hormones balanced and I literally regained my life I have had no long term effects no weight gain no side effects at all For the right person this works amazingly well For others it does not But it IS worth a try
439,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,41559,11,I have taken Provera once before to help regulate my period My menstrual cycle is very irregular I can go up to months between cycles with some cycles lasting up to months and it seemed to have worked after the first time taking it However after six months or so my periods became irregular once again Ive just started taking it for the second time and it seems to be working although I will have to say its given me some pretty intense mood swings
440,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41555,26,My first shot of DepoProvera was almost three months ago and I am due for my second shot in less than two weeks I will not get that second shot and must say DepoProvera worked very bad for me Ive been bleeding straight for two months now awful mood swings and depression extensive hair loss and no sex drive at all
441,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41540,26,DepoProvera has changed my life I am now period and yeast infection free Which is a HUGE deal for someone who has suffered from yeast infections x a month for the past years as well as heavy painful periods Havent had a period since my first shot which was weeks ago I am a healthy year old aside from suffering from migraines I have not had any side effects from DepoProvera no acne hair loss weight gain etc
443,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41536,11,Ive been on Depo for about a year My periods used to be very heavy but now they are very light The downside is that they last about weeks Ive gained about pounds and experience some pretty crazy mood swings My libido has completely crashed and I almost always need to use lube I got DepoProvera because it fits my lifestyle theres no way I could take a pill at the same time everyday
445,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41518,17,DepoProvera worked very well In fact I really loved it I only gained about pounds I do work out times a week Had my period times a year and it was so easy just one shot every three months The only downside was I got a bunch of acne and a bit of hair loss Each month around my period I still had the cravings but never got my period Now that I am off my acne cleared up a bit I highly recommend this birth control Very effective
447,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41514,13,Ive tried different birth control pills before trying the DepoProvera Theres no estrogen so I dont get moody or sensitive I also didnt gain any weight at all and was able to go back down to my normal body weight that I was prior to taking the pill version of birth control The only side effect I feel is a little bit of soreness in my hip after the injection but thats to be expected The one complaint I have is that youre only able to stay on it for years Id stay on it until I wanted to be pregnant if they would let me
448,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41512,35,I was taking Provera for days after my fifth day my period came on a week later and has been on for a week I wanted to know how long would it last Before I had this my cycle stayed on for months none stop
449,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41489,16,Ive only had my first shot The first month was okay I was always hungry severe backaches amp headaches and few hot flashes I got my cycle a week or so late Im in my nd month and Ive been having really bad cramps constant bleeding and diarrhea No weight gain at least not yet
450,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42136,11,I decided to get the shot a month ago So far I have not had a period at allwhich is almost scary but who wants their period anyway No weight gain as of yet and no hair loss I almost backed out of getting the shot once I heard a few horror stories The only thing I have noticed is a little moodiness which happens to me on the pill too so nothing new Not sure about getting the second shot yetwe will see how the next couple months go and if any other symptoms take place but so far it has been great
452,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42132,3,I was on the depo shot when I was and had shots and BOY DID I BLEED the best part was the fact that I never had any cramps but I bled for over years straight and didnt have a regular cycle intill reaching the rd year
454,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42132,12,I have been on this shot for just about one yearI have had one period since being on it which lasted almost a month not heavy by any means still very annoyingNot noticed any weight gain but I always go up and down give or take poundsI would recommend it everyone is different and has different side effects so it is unknown how one persons body will take to itBut worth testing it outHated the Pill
455,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42131,18,Honestly everyones bodies work differently and Ive heard horror stories about every type of birth control but this one has been really excellent for me Ive been on the depo shot for years now planning on switching soon The shot does sting a bit so be sure its injected into your hip instead of arm First month I spotted nonstop but I havent had a single period since No pregnancy scares Very gradual weight gain for me lbs over the past five years Cleared up my acne have plenty of libido I give it
456,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42131,4,I have actually just had my th shot and its been great for me Bled on cerazette like crazy so switched to depo injection My only complaint is that in the nd shot I got really bad boob pain and a bit of weight gain Never had a scare good birth control and also its every months so no problem
457,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42129,7,This is the best birth control I have been on so far I used to be on the pill and it made my periods irregular made me gain a crazy amount of weight made my acne worsen made me super emotional all the time and many other bad side effects I was off birth control for a couple of months and was back to my normal self and actually lost about pounds My doctor thought I should take birth control again and recommended that I switch to this so I took a chance I had one period after I got my first shot about months ago and havent had one since The only bad side effect that I have had with this shot is I gained a little bit of my weight back
458,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,42129,13,I have always had amenorrhea irregular periods my whole life Recently at I discovered that I have PCOS Polycystic ovarian syndrome by testing that was done I am starting to take Metformin to help it I have to have Provera prescribed every months for prevention of endometrial cancer I have depression and PMDD which is a severe form of PMS so the only downside is that it makes me extremely depressed for when I do have my period But it always makes me have my period by the third fourth or recently fifth day It does what it is supposed to do though and that is good
459,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,42129,18,I have always had amenorrhea irregular periods my whole life Recently at I discovered that I have PCOS Polycystic ovarian syndrome by testing that was done I am starting to take Metformin to help it I have to have Provera prescribed every months for prevention of endometrial cancer I have depression and PMDD which is a severe form of PMS so the only downside is that it makes me extremely depressed for when I do have my period But it always makes me have my period by the third fourth or recently fifth day It does what it is supposed to do though and that is good
461,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42128,12,I am and have been on Depo since I was due to severe menstrual bleeding When I first got the shot I noticed my bleeding kept lightening up until my second shot and it stopped all together I eat like a pig but thats not really a big deal for me During the first months I lost pounds and slightly over a year later Ive gained back I know a lot of girls fidget and carry on over the weight issue but if you exercise daily and eat appropriately it wont turn into a big deal I definitely recommend this to my friends who either have bleeding issues or just dont want to get pregnant Works PERFECTLY in both cases at least for me
462,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42128,23,This is HORRIBLE I have had the WORST anxiety than ever before and I havent stopped bleeding for weeksI only got this shot weeks ago thinking it would be good Would not recommend this to anyone
463,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42128,7,I had my second shot about a month agoI havent had constant bleeding every now and then maybe times since January I have had spotting I have experienced some cramps but not as bad as I usually get and I have definitely gained weight I had sex for the first time since I started the injection and I have been getting cramps and bleeding like I used to before the injection This has been going on for a week now I am worried and Im not sure if this is normal after having sex on the injection Apart from whats happening at the moment I personally do recommend this injection I started it to stop the pain and just have a break from bleeding and it has done exactly what I wanted it to
464,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42127,8,So yes its effective BUT NEVER GET THIS SHOT I had it times months worst nine months of my life Constant spotting and bleeding never was able to go on the boat because I didnt have enough bleeding for a tampon but would bleed threw a bathing suit felt very uncomfortable and always had to think about if I was bleeding never wore white bottoms or pants It was THE WORST experience of my life If you see this DONT TAKE THE SHOT
465,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42127,29,I have been bleeding for months straight nonstop I am not a happy camper I only got this shot to stop my cycles for a bit but I got totally the opposite I will not get another shot ever
466,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42127,10,I have been on the depo shot for about two months about weeks ago I started having a lot of pressure around my tail bone area horrible cramps way more emotional and spotting then BAM Mother nature hits with a vengeance non stop period yes the depo is awesome because not getting prego but not having sex is having the same affect
467,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42126,11,Ive been having constant bleeding or just huge blood clots since I got the shot weeks ago Also its caused me the worst anxiety and depression Ive ever experienced in my life I would not recommend this to anyone ever
468,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42126,7,I have been on the depo shot since October After my first shot I bled for months straight I consulted with my doctor and she said it was normal I got my second shot and I bled weeks straight Within the shots I started noticing acne headaches all the time and lots of anxietyfatiguedizziness and I find myself being hungry all the time I told myself that I would not get a rd shot I have severe cramps and I have not bled since the weeks after I got my nd shot so I was happy about not having a period I decided to go ahead and get the rd shot I have not had any bleeding but the acne and headaches anxiousness dizziness and fatigue are all still happening I dont like what the shot is doing to my body therefore I
470,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42125,35,The reason this shot is such an effective form a birth control is because it keeps you from sex THATS RIGHT The bleeding is so on and off that its kept me completely abstinent At first I thought this shot was the bomb but seriously I keep telling myself my body will adjust but I feel like Im constantly on my period Its messed up
471,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42125,4,I started the depo a little over years ago but took my last shot in August Since then I have had normal periods but some times have heavy periods in between my periods so Im almost bleeding a month and a half I have had horrible mood swings amp horrible cramps It was great while I was on it I even lost lbs while on it But this sucks
472,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42124,1,The depo shot is extremely effective however I had the horrible experience of mood changes I became an absolute terror and began becoming depressed after just one shot I am switching back over to the pill
474,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42122,4,I really like the shot I have had no weight gain or any other side effects I did bleed very lightly for two weeks my periods normally last or days after the first month on it but I havent had any periods since then Occasionally I will get brown discharge or very light spotting but it is such a small amount that I dont even notice I cant take most birth control because I cant have estrogen but I am very happy with the shot
477,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41694,19,Ive been on the Depo shot for Months I had shots so Faru the first shot was great Ive had no periods at all when I got my second shot About weeks after I started bleeding almost everyday but once I got my third shot it had stopped I am not having any problems so far But I Am constantly losing weight like when I started the shot I was lbs I am now lbs how is this happening I eat all the time
479,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41688,19,I have been on Depo for about a year now I got it in April in and now its February I kept bleeding since I got it till about October So I had about shots by then When got my rd shot I stopped bleeding I havent got a period since then I weighed about lbs now I weigh lbs I gained so much weight
480,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41687,8,I started using DepoProvera middle of January it has been a month and I havent had a period I have severe breast ache on my left breast and sometimes I may get cramps I sleep all the time and I am always tired and on edge I have control on the way I feel and I am grateful for the injection as I forget to take my pills
483,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,41679,26,My first birth control experience was a disaster I was taking TriSprintec TriSprintec made me gain pounds acne increased my periods and did the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do After one year of searching the internet for an alternative option I came across the DepoProvera shot I have been on it now for months so this is my third shot and I have come across no weight gainno periods and I think I am one of the few women who has been so lucky The only thing is for the first month of EACH shot you have bloating some pain a little headaches etc It goes away for me after that Nothing I cant handle compared to the periods I was getting before Everyone is different though but I highly recommend this
484,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41679,14,It was great at first No periods and no hassle of taking a pill However I was so tired all the time that I would sleep hours and want to go right back to sleep It also made me very depressed and moody almost manic at times Not to mention it made my breasts smaller
485,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,41678,39,My doctor put my on DepoProvera after laproscopy for endometriosis I had irregular periods after the first shot and after the second I remember I had one period that seemed to last for a month This is a known side effect and as promised it went away after the third shot I havent had my period now in about a year I also havent had any debilitating endometriosis symptoms either I think I gained about lbs total but then again Im also in my s and that could simply be a part of aging I am a big fan It gave me nearly total relief after getting through the first months
486,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41668,24,Ive been on the DepoProvera jab for years due to heavy periods Ive not had one since I spot occasionally but that is very rarely Its not for everyone warranted but it changed my life It has its ups and downs but Im a strong person and I manage the mood swings and Im sensible enough to know now that nearer the time of my jab I get cravings for food and after Ive had it they go My skin improved and I lost weight Thats because I knew it can cause cravings so I managed it I would recommend it if you are a strong willed sensible person Its not a lighthearted contraceptive
488,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41667,15,I am wks into shot and feel horrible My sex drive is gone side pains cramps headaches and so tired all the time My mood swings make me feel like I am crazy Oh and now I have this metallic taste in my mouth I just want to sleep all day because of the constant crampingI feel horrible My face is changing too I am black and my face looks so dry and discolored
489,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41661,27,Had the depo shot for about weeks now I too experiened bleeding for quite a while until my rd shot very light but it look like a normal side effect Now I am completely fine not gained any weight no migraines no pms Sometimes bleeding a week before Im due for my next shot but I was assured that is common
490,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41651,38,I have severe endometriosis and a lot of scar tissue from laparoscopic surgery four years ago when they removed two large cysts that were wrapped around my fallopian tube which I lost Then last year my right ovary hemorrhaged and I bled internally for two days two weeks ago I had a cyst rupture on my ride side I am SO done with being in pain Ive been in non stop monthly HELL for the past years So I got back on the DepoProvera shot I took it when I was a teenager for two years for my endo pain And I loved it I am so glad to be back on it I am also on a seizure medicine that makes birth control ineffective but has no effect on the Depo shot so that is another plus
492,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41642,17,I have been on DEPROVERA shot for about a year and a half It works of course But I have recently decided to quit with the shots because of the horrible side effects I have headaches every single day I just want to sleep and thats all I want to do Im a very active person so that was easy to notice Also I get horrible shooting pains that is in my lower stomach and back
493,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,41621,25,I was really worried about taking this medication I was on birth control and was very moody and emotional and gained about pounds so I went off it and didnt get my period for over months I was told to take this pill for days and I would get my period to days later I took it and sure enough days later I got it Very few side effects just that I was tired My period is kind of heavy but it has been months so I have to make up for lost time I practically had no cramps and feel so much better than I thought I would Definitely would highly recommend it I had a very positive experience
494,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41618,31,I have just recently got my second shot a few weeks ago and since I received my first shot I havent had any periods or abnormal bleeding or spotting I dont even get any side effects It has helped so much since I used to get severe painful cramps and lay in bed for the week when I had my periods It makes me have a lot less things to worry about like chance of pregnancy periods cramps and a lot more things my body was emotionally drained from
495,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41607,34,I have been on the Depo shot for about years now I love it No periods or spotting Cramps sometimes but nothing outrageous I think its a very good birth control
496,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41594,10,Im years old I was on the pill at first but I got off because I was ALWAYS moody So I got on Depo so far its been okay but since Ive been on it my face has started peeling Im always putting lotion on my face
497,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41593,12,I have been on Depo Provera since I was so about five years I have had no issues with it I have not had a period in years before I had terribly heavy periods I did not experience any weight gain do not have trouble staying fit and do not experience any moodpersonality swings I just dont like that its likely weakening my bones but I try to stay on top of that with calciumD supplements However I do wonder if its had a negative effect on my sex drive but thats inconsistent and I have nothing to compare it to since I got my shot as soon as I became sexually active so its hard to say
498,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41591,13,Comment As mentioned in my previous comment I personally have had no issued with the Depo shot and would have loved to continue on this form of BC The reason I am stopping is because my older sister tried the shot about years ago while I was away at school I never knew this about her experience and our doctor says this side affect has never happened before but it was like the others where she experienced CONSTANT HEAVY bleeding for months straight but it wasnt like a period blood she was bleeding internally It made her blood cell count change so drastically they thought she had cancer She was hospitalized for about a month I will not be continuing the Depo Shot because she has begged me not too
499,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41590,18,I have been on the depo shot for almost months now and it hasnt been too bad The only problems Ive had is severe mood swings nausea and headaches daily Im a sick person anyways so Im not sure if Ive gotten other side effects but I do know those are from the depo My periods are now pretty much gone My second shot I had a period for about months but it wasnt heavy I plan on getting off of it though after this shot wears off because I have been reading a lot of bad things about the shot Severe mood swings depression anxiety hair loss osteoporosis infertility etc I eventually want to get pregnant but you can lose all options if you continue the shot for an extended period of time and I dont want that to happen
500,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41889,23,Very effective but bad side effects Im and Ive had two doses of it but I wont be continuing it I have gained weight that is IMPOSSIBLE to lose I get head rushes and I feel dizzy almost every time I stand up and lots of cramping I stopped getting my period but one every monthtwo months I have a few drops of blood but thats it Im not happy with the shot but it was effective
504,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,41865,31,Ive been on the shot since April now that I have my second shot I spotted blood a few times but now theres constant bleeding
505,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41865,11,Im yrs old I went on DepoProvera for months and it was horrible I constantly felt like I was running a fever and sweating like crazy I had horrible PMS but no period The only good thing about it was the convenience
506,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41864,34,I started this birth control at lbs so I was already a little heavy but I was working out and eating healthy to keep losing weight The first shot seemed fine By the second shot I gained lbs which I thought was odd but the doctor said it was normal I then started becoming very depressed and spent most of my days sleeping or in bed I gained another lbs when it was time for the third shot The rd shot made me gain more lbs where I was at I always ate relatively healthy and went to the gym And I decided to not take the th shot And its been about a month past when I was supposed to take the th shot and Im finally starting to lose weight Im at now and still have a long way to go
507,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,41862,57,I only had one shot It lasts months During those months I got my period the first month amp not the other two Now I came down to Trinidad on vacation before I was able to get my second shot Now Ive been bleeding for months STRAIGHT I know this is abnormal I have the worst cramps amp my whole body hurts
508,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41862,38,I have been on the DepoProvera shot for years I love it I havent had a period since I got the first shot Then one day randomly I started spotting I wasnt to concerned at first but the bleeding went on and got heavier over a span of months I had been trying to get into the doctors but that hadnt been working out Finally I was able to talk to my doctor and it just turned out to be my body basically adapting to the progestin so instead of coming in every weeks I come in every to weeks depending on if I start bleeding
509,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41861,18,Ive had DEPO PROVERA for about two years for the first couple of months I was bleeding like crazy then it lightened up to only spotting occasionally and bleeding the week my next shot was due I gained pounds throughout the two years which was not bad but recently Ive been bleeding for almost a week straight it kind of sucks because I have a boyfriend and I want to have sex I just have to deal with maybe the next time Ill get the shot it wont be as bad If the bleeding continues as it does now I might just go back on the pill
510,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41860,15,My first shot of depo was great no mood swings or any other side affects other than some very light spotting Happy with my first shot I got a nd but it didnt turn out as the first shot did Im happy because theres no mood swings or really any mental side effects which is why I switched from the pill However I was told my period would completely go away or just be light spotting but for some reason I have now been having a normalheavy period for over a month now which concerning Ive also been experiencing a lot of headaches and cramps that can get so bad theyll sometimes wake me up from dead sleep Ill be going to the doctor soon to get off of this blood loss is not fun c dont think this is super common though
514,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41844,20,I gained pounds on Depo Provera shot
515,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41841,24,When I was I had the WORST period Major cramps to where I couldnt go to school bloated super bad So my dr Recommended the shot I got it And since then Ive had not even the slightest spotting And its been years One night the condom broke completely and I was so worried But didnt get pregant Ive gained pounds over the course But I for sure recommend
516,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41841,6,I was on the Depo shot for a little over a year and a half At first I had a very long period days for a few months when my period was generally about days previously Then I stopped having a period altogether Its been a month since I was due for my shot After reading online I was worried that I would be waiting monthsyear to get my period back after it however I woke up today and thankfully got it Ive never been so happy to get my period before I guess Im one of those lucky few that get their period back as soon as they are off of it
517,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41835,17,My first shot was July the last shot was March Four shots total and in that time I had some type of vaginal discharge every month I wore some type of pantyliner or pad everyday during this time because I never knew if I would have a period The bleeding wasnt always heavy but I bled enough that I became iron deficient anemic I did experience larger than normal clots some months I wanted to try the full year to see if my periods would ever stop but the lack of iron made me get off Depo
518,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,41831,13,After years of not getting the shot I decided it was time again endometriosis is very painful and it had returned so it was time The last Depo Provera shot was great no periods no weight gain no hormonal imbalances This time I have the hormones of a pregnant woman and Ive been bleeding heavily for two weeks since giving myself the shot I dont have cramping too bad and my face has cleared but this hormonal imbalance headaches and heavy bleeding is kicking my butt even more tired than normal
519,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41824,36,I do not like this medicine Ive only had one shot so far I didnt come on my period for two months now on the third month Ive been on for weeks already The pain is worse then my normal cramps Im not getting my second shot Im only
521,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41822,6,I am with kids I tried the pill but had incredibly tender breasts tried the copper coil for weeks but had cramps and spotting I thought Id give Depo Provera injection just one go I dont think my body likes hormonal contraception I am constantly bleeding after the injection AND I suddenly have psoriasis all over my face and hands Its peeling red and itchy I look like someone beat me up Its embarrassing as you can imagine
522,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41821,11,I was on the shot for years Im pounds naturally I weighed up to while on the shot It is extremely effective for protection against pregnancy Although I have no sex drive and terrible mood swings and weight gain in abdomen face and buttocks The pros would be clear skin and effectiveness against pregnancy but wouldnt recommend it for short term birth control or for women who gain weight easily Took my body almost a year to regulate itself after stopping
524,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41819,7,Does its job as a birth control Convenient that it is only every months and its discreet However the side effects arent worth it I had mood swings increased appetite and cravings which lead to a lb weight gain within first months and constant bleeding for over months Once I switched to the pill after my first shot my appetite went back to normal Im acting like myself and the bleeding stopped immediatelyI receive free service at Planned Parenthood as a teenager so all of my birth controls are at no cost
526,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42089,16,I have been on this shot for years almost now I had had no serious problems I gained about pounds and I am having trouble losing it but that is it When I first got on this I actually lost weight amp was the smallest Id ever been but I decided to try to switch to the pill hated it amp then got back on Depo which is when the weight gain happened I had major mood swings but am now on another medication to help control that It definitely works and love not having a period Just hate the weight gain This is definitely a birth control I would recommend
527,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42088,0,for a long time i have been irregular bleeding i would bleed for months on end but sometimes it wouldnt be bad just light but others it would be to were i couldnt stand up so i finally had enough of that and went to the obgyn she presribed me provera and i am just now on my third pill on my second i started lightly spotting but it went away then today thrid pill i am bleeding not bad but enough to wear a pad hopefully this works im not to sure right now
530,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,42084,34,I hadnt had a period in months My doctor prescribed me Provera mg once a day for days She stated if I get my period in those days to stop taking the pill at that time Today was day and my period came I had no side effects from this medication I had normal cramps at the onset of my period this morning It seems to be a normal beginning flow as with any other time I had my period I will report back to let everyone know how long it lasted
531,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42083,0,I would never reccomend this shot to anyone I know everyone is different but i am years old and have been on it for years Ive experienced crazy weight gain hair loss and my anxiety was bad before but now it is terrible where it is causing me to not even sleep at night anymore I do like the no periods but all the other side effects just kind of ruin that If you are looking for birth control methods all i have to say is just DONT pick the depo shot
533,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42079,67,I have been on the shot since December th have had a period from January th to the present
535,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42078,29,Had abnormal bleeding after getting double dose that was a month before next dose
536,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42077,0,I got the depo shot months after having my daughter in I wanted to make sure I didnt get pregnant again No periods at all and no side effects other than always wanting chicken I only got the shot that one time though because I moved and didnt have the insurance coverage anymore to get the shot I recently decided to get the shot again when I got a new boyfriend It was horrible I had constant headaches and more pregnancy symptoms than I had when I was actually pregnant I also bled for weeks at a time I decided I would give it another try after talking to my doctor and reading online that most people have issues the first one my issues are still the same with the bleeding I hate it
538,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42075,0,Was having some trouble with the pill i was on for a year and switched to the shot The first three months were great No weight gainacne and I felt great After about two and a half months I began to start bleeding and having severe cramps so much so I could not stand up straight At the height of my cramps I discovered my body had shed my entire uterine lining at one time and it was the most frightening and gross thing I had seen After the three months had finished I had my period for seven weeks and am finally back on my regular schedule Never again will I use this shot
541,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42070,1,I took the shot after weeks postpartum due to breastfeeding aswell Slowly but surely I started experiencing minor side effects which graduly became worse after the rd shotOMGi gained pounds in months severe insomia heart palpitationshair loss severe anxiety arm pain shooting from my shoulder to my fingers numbness and tingling on both arms fatigue depressed When I really started getting concerned was when I started twitching and would goult out of my sleep with anxiety attacksI had chest pains n poking sensations in my heartI had no clue it was really from the shot till I decided to skip my next appointment and With in days of not getting the next dose I started feeling so much betterthe shot is POISON
543,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42069,1,I am years old and have been on DepoProvera for almost two years while in a four year committed relationship My doctor recommended DepoProvera for me because I suffer from chronic migraines so any birth control with a high level of estrogen would most definitely make my migraines worse So far I have to say I am pleased with my experience while on the depo shot The side effects I have experienced have thankfully been able to be fixedaltered Such as slight weight gain which I help to control with diet and exercise Loss of sex drive which my longtime boyfriend is more than happy to help with And I tend to start spotting around the time that my next shot is due Once I receive the depo shot within hours the spotting stops
544,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42064,29,I love how all of you say that you cant lose weight on Depo I gained about pounds started dieting and exercising and now I have lost all of that weight and more Yes I have some spotting but its better than having to take a pill everyday
546,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42063,40,I am years old and bled heavily for weeks Due to my religious beliefs I will not accept blood under any and all circumstances so I tried provera at an attempt to stop the bleeding On the st pill I went from bleeding heavily to just brown spotting and after days my bleeding completely stopped I was on mg for days I just completed my last pill today and feel better than ever Just happy that Im not bleeding anymore and I can be a mom to my month old daughter
547,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42062,14,It is effective However the weight gain of lbs now I need to lose lbs The headaches dizziness and tiredness Feeling hungry constantly and occasional numbness in my hands and feet I am thinking of trying Implanon but the reviews dont look so great Would prefer getting my tubes tied as we have a nice size family I have been on it months since my youngest was born and I hate that I eat and feel pregnant even though I am not
548,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42061,75,I got the Depo shot in October It is now February and I have been either spotting or full on bleeding since then I cant have sex because I start to bleed as if my period just started Ive been on and off the Depo for years and this is the first time Ive had a bad experience with it I also gained pounds since October but I eat healthy and go to the gym regularly
549,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42057,6,New years eve I went and got my first birth control shot Ive been on the pill but Im inconsistent and it didnt do much for me No side effects except for oneNo periodThis is a possible side effect but the website says only of users and only after a year of use I was hoping for it but had resigned myself to waiting until Both this month and last month I could feel quotphantom crampsquot mine are in my back but no blood No pain Just a very tiny ache like what it used to feel like before I started Im very happy with it because it used to be bad enough to keep me in bed all day I just hope it lasts
550,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41367,10,Ive been on the shot for months now When I first got the shot about three weeks in I started to bleed like normal period but then got lighter and lighter and continued for weeks Eventually it went into light spotting about every weeks for a few days I also will get a lot of sharp pain cramps that will last a few minutes every now and then but this happens randomly Other than that I have no side effects The doctor tells me the spotting and cramps will stop as my body gets used to the shot
551,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41367,19,It was very effective amp I didnt experience ANY weight gain I lost weight My periods were shortlight amp it was nice not having to remember to take the pill everyday I DID experience more PMS also known as random crying tiredness dizziness and light bleeding between periods I heard your body starts to adjust to these symptoms after a while though but I got too nervous about not getting my period every month so I switched back to the pill If youre on the fence remember every person is different so why not give it try Its only for months at a time You can always switch back to normal birth control if you have any issues
552,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41358,20,I always had trouble finding the right birth control for years now Not only would certain ones contribute to a lot of weight gain or very bad mood swings I was horrible with taking my birth control pill on time I was having horrible cramping and pain with my periods to the point that I would have to call off from work Since being on the Depo shot I have had no side effects I always eat a lot and I dont work out often so if I do gain weight thats my own personal issue Im glad to read these reviews and to be informed about the bone density because my doctor clearly never told me that I havent had any mood swings or emotional breakdowns like the other pills did to me
554,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41355,14,Ive been on the Depo shot for and a half years I love it because Im not getting any periods and its not like the pill having to remember it daily However in the course of being on this shot I have gained pounds Im always hungry and I get very moody I also have extremely bad headaches Im switching to the Nuvaring because my weight gain is unbearable and my headaches are chronic
555,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41338,1,I was on Depo for over years Greatest years of my life No period No cramps No bloating No PMS No side effects NOTHING My doctor made me take a one year break from itas straight years is way longer than you should be on itbut my bone density is fineand I will be returning to my Depo next month This past year off of the Depo was the worst year of my life My period returned approx months after my last shot and got worse and worse with each one Horrible acne Weight gain Moodiness Depo took all of that away For those of you who had constant bleedingspotting after your first shotit is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you get your first shot on the th or th day of your period to make sure amenorrhea kicks in
557,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41332,14,Ive been on The Depo for about months now I got on it to stop my period but Ive had non stop bleeding the whole time I asked my doctor if there was anything she could do and she said to wait it out I searched about bleeding on the shot and tons of people said they bleed continuously the whole time they were on and some said once they stopped the shot the bleeding didnt stop I also am breaking out in places I normally dont like in my neck line and forehead Im not getting the shot again if the bleeding doesnt stop
558,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41331,4,Im and got the shot about months ago So far my periods have remained regular On the downside I now feel hungry ALL the time All I do is eat I have these irresistible cravings now Im noticing weight gain of course because Im stuffing my face but Im miserable if I dont eat what Im craving or when Im hungry Also Ive been having excruciating headaches I already have migraines I had them for years before I got on the shot but they had stopped when I started a new medicine now theyre back since Im on the shot Its terrible hopefully the cravings appetite headaches and also these mood swings Ive been having get better If not Im switching
560,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41303,19,I was on birth control pills Ortho Tricyclen Lo for about years My DR told me I have high blood pressure She thought it would be a good idea to get off the birth control pills to see if that was the main cause of the high blood pressure amp recommended that I go on Depo instead She told me I could get the shot right there and then and then I would have to come back in months and get another shot I have only been on Depo for months The first month I never got my period The second month Ive had my period for weeks I cant have sex because Im bleeding Im crabbiermoodier then usual I can fall asleep just fine but I wake up at am every morning and cant fall back to sleep Never had this happen before
561,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41296,26,I have been on Depo for years now and the first entire year I had spotting almost everyday After that I would only get my period about a week after I would get a new shot which last at least a full week but are very light I love this birth control because I dont have to remember to take a pill every day I didnt experience weight gain I actually lost weight after taking the shot but I did experience some acne which I am not sure is because of the Depo or just minor adult acne I definitely recommend this method for birth control
562,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41293,25,Been on Depo Provera shot for months Dont know if its still early not to experience any side effects Im still happy on it and looking forward for my next shot The only thing Ive noticed is weight loss which I dont have a problem with but so far so good
563,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41284,62,I got on this as a teenager for my endometriosis Besides spotting for the first four months I have had no ill effects No weight gain In fact its hard to keep weight on I got off of it to have my kids Now Im back on it Its so much easier raising toddlers without cramps and random bleeding I recommend it highly Dont let bad experiences scare you I actually had a horrible time with the pill I love my Depo shots
564,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41279,23,I hate to be another bad contributor but I basically started out fine No period for the first month Then I was bleeding for the next two months The worst part gave me the most ridiculous acne of my life I have never broken out on my jaw line amp cheeks before this shot so that was very strange amp painful I have been off of Depo amp switched to Trinessa amp am on my th pack I STILL am trying to get my skin normal and regulate the hormone change And Im waiting for the dark spots from my acne from months ago to disappear Its nice to not remember a pill but because I had such bad side effects I didnt even try to get my second shot
565,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,41277,18,On Depo for approximately yrs go No problems or sideeffects No period for yrsHEAVEN Got off of it Doctor said since I had no bleeding last time would be okay to do again Got shot a month agothe week I was supposed to start First week was great No bleeding but have had continual spotting every day since wks Hopefully it will stop soon
569,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41252,10,I was on the shot for a year I spotted for months at a time which didnt seem like a good trade off for no period I also experience mood swings that I couldnt seem to control My acne got out of control and I had break outs in areas that I didnt normally have issues with Then to top it all off I gained about lbs while on this shot To me the pro convenience of getting one shot every three months didnt out way the cons
572,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41222,13,Hello Ive been on the Depo shot and Im fully satisfied I didnt have any side affects Lost my period which is normal amp gained pounds All I had to do is follow my doctors orders wait to hrs so it takes effect amp Im fully protected I really recommended it Its worth it if you dont want to have a huge responsibility of having a child Or in some cases having horrible cramps amp heavy periods Im fan of Depo shot Everybody is different it works for me but maybe not for you Ill never be off it unless Im married amp wanting children
574,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41217,12,Depo is GREAT I recommend it to everyone that I know I have been on Depo for about years now and frankly I dont fault Depo for the quotside effectsquot I have experienced Yes I have gained some weight But I also eat a lot of carbs and dont exercise nearly as much as I used to So you cant blame Depo for that Also my doctor made it quite clear to me that Depo could affect my bone density so I take a chewable calcium supplement every day and so far my bones are in great shape And lets talk about the number one life changer no period I used to have awful cramps and heavy bleeding but now I literally have no period whatsoever Occasional spotting but thats really rare and only lasts for a day do yourself a favor and try Depo
575,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41214,17,Started Depo years ago Spotted the first three months and felt horrible Then all side effects went away Got off of it to have my child and now Im back on it No bone issues No weight gain No complaints
577,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,41196,46,I have a really hard time taking estrogen birth control and I decided to get the Depo shot After reading the reviews I was so scared I canceled my appointment to get it After thinking about it I decided to just go ahead with it and see what happens Ive been on it a little more than weeks and Ive noticed that I am a little more tired and I have some pimples that are starting to go away Other than that I havent had any spotting tender breasts sexdrive changes etc Usually before my period I eat nonstop and have cravings and its nice to not have that I will write again to update how its going in a few weeks I wanted to let people know not to be terrified It may work for you and if it doesnt just dont get another shot
578,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,41193,29,I got my first shot in June and at first had my normal day period but in July I started bleeding again and been bleeding since I got my second shot in August and that didnt help Im still bleeding and having migraines that I never had before and its October
579,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41192,2,I am and was on it for half a year and never had a period I got off it in January and still today have no period and its been months
581,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41168,11,I was less than pleased to find out that I could use only the Depo shot for birth control I was on it before about yrs ago and I gained weight my hair fell out etc etc So this time around right after the first shot I bled spotted literally for months straight Every day Also I was very very moody irritable and my sex drive tanked Really bad I decided to take the second shot at the last minute and I cant be happier that I hung in there I have not bled once since my moods have stabilized and my sex drive is back Also I was worried that I would gain weight but believe it or not I have lost a few lbs
583,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41151,6,I have had my period for two months so far This has caused me to be extremely anemic which has made my hair fall out and Im so weak
584,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41150,4,I have been on Depo Provera for years now It seems like a lot but Im and have been on it since I turned so there is not much bone loss Im off it now but I loved it I didnt gain weight no cramping no nausea no migraines I WAS depressed but the Depo actually fixed it I bleed light for about a week right before my shot is due but its once every months I love it but years is pushing it for osteoporosis so I just switched to the pill today
586,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41135,3,I took my first Depo shot in February of this year and for the first month I didnt have any side effects so I thought it was great but then came the abnormal bleeding I literally had spotting from March to June It was so miserable even after it wore off it was still happening Finally just this month yesterday my period came back normally Also I had really bad acne the whole time it was in my system when normally I dont have acne at all and I dont just mean a couple of pimplesit was like deep acne which left me with scars on my face Other than those two side effects Depo is pretty awesome as I didnt get pregnant and didnt have to remember to take a pill Im now on Ortho TriCyclen and seeing how that works out
587,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41134,10,My experience on Depo has been a nightmareI have been on it for almost a year I will be bleeding for a month straight then it will stop for a week or two if Im lucky then its right back to bleedingI have also had awful headaches bad body aches severe abdominal cramping mood swings random depression and chest pains
588,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41126,2,Im years old and I have only been on the shot for months and some change now I like the shot I had regular periods before but they were really heavy and painful I tried the pills once and took all of them A couple of times I forgot to take them on time but took two the next day but the shot works better for me The only negative thing I have to say is it does mess with my moods like Ill get sad out of no where and start tripping and the weight gain I dont mind because Im already a size I want to gain some weight During the first month I spotted the whole time Not a regular period just brown spotting But its gone away now and like I said Ive only been on it for months and some change now so overall for me I like
589,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41120,0,I tried the shot twice once on August and recently started again in May First time was bad I had really bad anxiety and moodiness which at first I thought it was hormones from having the baby I couldnt lose weight even though I was exercising everyday After the months the first time no more moodiness like before when I was on it I had also lose weight and things were back to normal I wanted to try again because I only did it once but again it has been a bad experience
590,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,41115,36,It has been almost months since my shot and I have been on my period the whole time I gained pounds and I was the most depressed Ive ever been I went insane with mood swings my already bad pain got worse and I had head splitting migraines among other things I dont recommend it to anyone It should come with a prescription for Xanax and some weight loss pills to try to stay on top of things
591,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41112,39,Been on this shot since June Started experiencing abdominal pain on July and spotting on July SEVERE abdominal cramps as of July that continues I turned up anemic when I had not been just month before As of today I am still experiencing abdominal cramps periodically continue to spot or have what seems like a full fledged period alternately without any pattern My Gyno placed me on the shot to stop my heavy bleeding due to Uterine Fibroids I will not take a second shot as along with the heavy bleeding continuing as before I have severe pain extreme fatigue weight gain even after increased physical activity
592,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41089,14,Im and Ive been on the Depo shot since I was about or so about years now I havent had any side effects whatsoever I dont spot to often only when its about time to get my shot again which I think is pretty normal My only concern is the osteoporosis I am going to be going this next week to get a test done It just worries me because I get all this negative feedback from people I really dont want to be one of those But I can say my sex drive is high I dont gain weight I dont get acne what so ever if anything it has helped So all in all its a pretty positive experience
593,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41087,10,I did one cycle of the Depo shot and at first I wasnt suffering any side effects I felt fine and really it was so much easier than taking a pill every day Naturally on OrthoCyclen I forgot all the time So the shot was refreshing and just plain easy to be on in that aspect After about a week and a half I started to notice an increased appetite Im talking I was hungry ALL THE TIME Also I experienced severe acne I went from having a break out maybe once a month to my face being covered in acne I didnt experience any weight gain but I was also doubling my workout time because of the appetite increase
594,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,8,41085,32,I am yrs old and Ive been trying to get pregnant since February My last menstrual period was March and I never had period after that Ive been going to my Obgyn for the past months and finally she prescribed me Provera for days once a day pill And i decided to use ovulation predictor kit days before I took my st pill last June On my rd day of taking my pill my ovulation predictor went positive it gave me a smiley face On my th day of Provera I experienced a very weird dreams hot flashes PMS backache a little dizzy I had my last pill June Friday and this is my day off of it Im hoping that I could get my period soon so that way I can start taking Clomid
595,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,41073,29,Took two pills a day for ten days and started my cycle three days after the last pill Felt nauseous the first day of taking the pill but it did what it was supposed to do so no real complaints Not sure if my cycle will regulate in the future though
597,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,41069,23,After two months on the shot I started to bleed spotting and breakthrough bleeding is not uncommon but this was much more My doctor kept telling me to stick it out that it can take up to months to stop after months of almost everyday bleeding we decided to call it quits It does wonders for some but didnt for me
599,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41060,9,I thought this would be a great option Well I was definitely wrong I was on the patch when my parents found out I was on birth control subsequently they took the rest away I went to my school clinic and received the shot the same day for free I did not have to worry about prescriptions or about hiding my patches anymore which was great and all Until the first week in I felt fine then something just dramatically changed with me I had no sex drive pain during intercourse pounds of weight gain for the first two months and for the third month and spotting daily I also had terrible mood swings and migraines I felt depressed from the weight gain I wasnt me anymore
600,Medroxyprogesterone,Renal Cell Carcinoma,7,41059,14,I was diagnosed with Polycystic ovarian syndrome after thinking I was pregnant because I hadnt had a cycle in months My ob ran tests and found I had a hormonal disorder PCOS and to force a period prescribed me Provera once a month for days It made me have all the regular PMS symptoms but I also have experienced prolonged heavy flow
603,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41039,6,I was on the shot for almost years since my doctor didnt want me on the pill because I have high blood pressure due to my first pregnancy Well it backfired I gained pounds after starting the shot became extremely depressed mood swings and my sex drive completely gone Also I am blonde and my leg hair turned brown I have been on the shot for almost months and have started spotting very little and acne on my back migraines and wicked cramps
604,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41027,3,I decided to take the Depo for birth control instead of the pill because I am terrible at remembering to take it daily The first month I had no problems it worked great Now in the second month I had two weeks of spotting and now another week of a full period continues I plan on switching birth control methods next month
606,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41023,5,I have been on Depo for months now and Im pretty satisfied with it I have had no bleeding problems no weight gain or any bodily pain The only problem I have had with the shot is that I have definitely experienced mood swings I am one of the most levelheaded people I know and within the first week of being on the shot I was more emotional than Ive ever been in my entire life I drove my family and boyfriend absolutely crazy I eventually got accustomed to the hormones but even now every few weeks I have days where I fly completely off the wall or just cry for hours for absolutely no reason It happens infrequently enough that taking Depo is still worth itThis is definitely a quotyour mileage may varyquot birth control
607,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41023,2,I used it for months shots and never had a period or spotting or cramps or anything I have been moody and depressed but I dont know if its from the shot No weight gain But you cant lose weight either I didnt have a bad experience at all
609,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41008,8,I have had only two shots and have horrible mood swings Im ALWAYS angry or upset at something and Ive lost all desire for sex putting a strain on my relationship The only thing good I can say is not having to remember to take a pill
610,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41007,4,I have almost completed my nd month round and will not get another shot I have to work hard and eat right just to keep from gaining even more weight its very hard to lose I developed acne I never had before Recently I have been getting daily Charlie horses in my vagina very painful Very dry have to use lubricant every time and almost no sex drive at all Already had painful sex before but this has made it worse The only good thing is only having to remember it every months
611,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40984,3,Was on the shot for about years Loved it Not bleeding no cramps and I still had my very active sex life Towards the end of that years I realized I gained about lbs Thats a lot for me I have very high metabolism Then my hair started to thin out I had to stop taking it I cant seem to lose the weight which is annoying Now Im on birth control pills I dont like it at all No sex drive and some acne and serious mood swings Did I mention no sex drive If the pills dont work after months I am going to consider going back to the shot
612,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40984,7,I am years old I have been on the Depo since I was I got on it after my week check up When I first started on the Depo shot I was a very mean person I have NEVER in my life been like that I am a very nice laid back person I gained lbs withing the first months I am not a big eater and I do eat healthy for the most part I also had pregnancy like symptoms headaches and bloating After a year of being on the Depo my mood had changed and I became back to myself and my body got used to it I really really LOVE the Depo shot but I am thinking of switching to another method I love how I havent had a period in years and it is effective but I cannot deal with it making my weight go up and down Overall minus few things I love it
614,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40971,10,I have been on Depo for two months have not had a period my acne cleared up and I lost two pounds Fantastic birth control
618,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40939,4,Ive loved being on the Depo shot I have had no problems and not had a period since being on it for a year Its a very easy form of contraception and doesnt cause me any problems No weight gain or sickness
619,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40933,5,Have been having terrible reaction to this medicine Chest pain and shortness of breath
620,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40930,6,I had a very bad expirence with Depo I was on it for months and bled for months straight What a nightmare It also caused painful sex I had terrible mood swings and also gained weight The only good thing about depo is you dont have to worry about taking it every day or month
622,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40918,3,I was on the Depo for two years and was awesome for the first months I seriously thought I was in heaven I still had periods but had absolutely no cramps at all which is saying a lot since I had horrible pains before and the bleeding was light I started the Depo because I couldnt remember the pill Things were going well and then I started a period that lasted for a year I would have stayed on the Depo regardless of the bleeding but it was the horrible mood swings that made me stop using it I was seriously a miserable person Though this was my experience it could be different for others My body never reacts the way it should Really the only way to know is to try it yourself
623,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40917,5,Started this birth control when I was am now Had my period for about weeks when I first started but have not since Only had spotting if I was getting close to being late for shot Did not gain weight like a lot of people claim Have not had bone density loss but have taken calcium supplements No period no cramps no babies love it
627,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40082,40,I became pregnant with twins as I was not informed to refrain from sexual activity for weeks
628,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40079,43,Been on the Depo for years now No periods Terrible weight gain Mood changes Im looking to get off of it
629,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40071,3,I was on the Depo for about years and after some initial spotting about months I loved it Super easy nearly painless very effective If it werent for the bone loss controversy Id still be on it I didnt notice any side effects my period was replaced by light spotting about weeks before I was due for my next shot
630,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,40070,14,I had been on Depo for years as a birth control method I knew that there was always something wrong with doctors They just told me that I had bad period cramping and basically to deal with it It is only now after I stopped the Depo to try and fall pregnant that doctors have now tested me for and confirmed that I have endometriosis The pain that I am in now is crazy but I am not going to go back on it in the hope that I may just by chance perhaps fall pregnant It worked really well for me when I was on it though had no cramping as my periods had stopped completely
631,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,40053,35,Stopped getting my period so I took this and it worked right away It didnt bring back my monthly cycle but it brought on a cycle after the last pill
632,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,40052,51,Depo has been great for relief of pain from endometriosis I am on my rd shot No more period but I do spot the whole month before the next shot is due I am hoping that will stop as my body gets used to it more The shot is painless the only side effect I have noticed is minor weight gain and my sex drive has decreased a bit I am okay with that at least the pain is gone I got scared reading what everyone had to say about this drug and almost didnt get it I am glad I took the chance to see how quotIquot reacted to it Everyone is different I am very satisfied with it
636,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,40024,29,I have been bleeding for six months now I was on the Depo for three years then I went off of it I am lb heavier and my eating habits and work outs never changed I felt horrible all the time headaches back pain As birth control it sure works great
637,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40023,0,I have been using this since the birth of my second child and years ago I love it No periods No daily medicines to try to remember I have had a bone density scan and it was normal so worries there either I think it is great
639,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39995,20,I have been on DepoProvera for or years and love it I started out with very few periods and all of them were very light Now I normally will lightly spot or clot before my next shot is due Now I never have any periods so its been great The only problem Ive had is just recently for my last shot I went to a different doctor and they gave me the generic version which caused me to bleed very heavily and severe cramping so I know to never use the generic form again
640,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,39972,79,It started off great for the first month But then by the second month my period became a monster It lasted for so long and started on a very random day that wasnt even close to my regular period cycle date Also Im on an emotional roller coaster ride and almost constantly angry at something or someone I dont like this at all
642,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,39961,10,I tried Depo for almost a year before finally switching to the pill due to repeated irregular bleeding And the symptoms I experienced were incredibly heavy and painful like Ive never experienced It worked great as birth control though and I didnt ever get pregnant but there was no prediction or pattern to my irregular bleeding and the pain of the cramps was something Ive never experienced since
643,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,39942,30,After years on DepoProvera I decided to stop because I was concerned about not having my periods My period didnt come back to normal until after months during this time off Depo I realized that suddenly my mood had improved and I wasnt sad all the time anymore I switched to Alesse and now realize how bad Depo was for me It made me moody all the time
644,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,39936,18,I first started DepoProvera due to irregular and heavy menstruation The first month was the worst with several side effects that did go away after the second shot I had severe breast tenderness with some lymph node swelling mood swings and constant spotting for the first month After the inital shot I never had a period again barely any spotting and felt well I did go off the shot for a while and now I am on it again I am having no side effects except for the initial moodiness and decrease interest in sex But I would still recommend this product for someone No periods Sign me up
645,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,39923,3,I have used Provera for four years and have never suffered from any side effects The only draw back is that my doctor insists that I have a period every months I take mg times a day and this stops my periods and therefore all the problems that are associated with endometriosis I only wish I could take the pills permanently
646,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,39915,106,I had nothing but negative effects from the Depo shot that are continuing even after the duration of action of the Depo I am now experiencing terrible migraines I rarely if ever had even minor headaches They have been occurring multiple times per day including nausea and diarrhea I experienced these same symptoms for the first time after I received my first shot I also experienced neck stiffness severe mood swings bouts of depression that seemed to arrive from nowhere no sex drive what so ever and worst of all menstrual bleeding for an entire month straight which was only counteracted by a high dosage of birth control pills
647,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39901,8,I am and have been on the shot for a year now I already have kids and this form of birth control seems to be very effective I cant remember to take the pill so the shot is great for me The only problem I have with it is I cant seem to lose the pregnancy weight from my second child But I rate it a
648,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,39897,73,I am and this is my second time on Provera The only side effects I have noticed are intense night sweats I am hotter than usual The day after my first dose I was nauseous and had a headache like a hangover it has happened a few other times during the days I do think that I can live with days a month of the Provera because I was bleeding a lot I was stuck at home At least now even if I dont feel good I can still leave home
650,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,40908,62,I am and I had my period for weeks straight so I went to the doctor and they told me I lost so much blood I had to get a blood transfusion then they put me on Provera mg x a day for months At first it stopped the bleeding for a month but then the Provera stopped working so my Dr switched me on birth control and that doesnt work either Ive been bleeding for a month now I dont know what to do
651,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40907,1,I have used it without scares for years I have found my libido seriously lowered No periods once I got past the initial or jabs Worth persisting May have some bleeding if you are late for a shot For the first few shots bleeding can be heavy and irregular but this seems to usually settle after about shots and I had no periods after that time unless I was getting late my shot late
652,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40879,5,In the beginning I thought this form of birth control was great I didnt have mood swings and didnt have a period After using this for a while I gained about lbs and had the hardest time losing it
653,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40874,1,Im twenty years old and Ive been on this birth control for over two years and have never had a problem with it Ive always had irregular periods and when I did have them I was in immense pain but since Ive been on the Depo shot I havent had any spotting or a period and its wonderful First week or so I had mood swings but that was all A in my book Also I havent had any bone density issues
654,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40873,15,I have been on this shot for almost years now starting out just to help with abdominal pain and now for use of birth control I love that I have never had a period let alone spotting no cramps nothing Just recently I have been having terrible headaches that make me nauseous I have gained at least lbs which is very depressing and sex drivewell thats long gonewhich seems very odd for a year old Reading the reviews helped a lot thank you
656,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40870,4,I have been on DepoProvera for almost four years I have generally loved it No periods and really no side effects I never experience a lowered sex drive and I live life normally with the exception of no period The only downsides are that I find myself constantly taking pregnancy tests because Im afraid I may be pregnant and not know it and Ive gained about lbs although I cant say it was completely the shots fault I am now looking for another form of birth control so that I will not be kept from losing weight just in case I gained because of the shot
659,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40861,4,I have been on Depo for at least yrs No menstrual cycle at all I LOVE THAT I stopped receiving the injection June still do not have my period I am so anxious about having children I cant wait No real side effects coming off of the shot just yet Im waiting to lose that weight they said I gained on it
660,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40859,8,Im a person that constantly forgets to take her birth control pill So I thought all of the side effects would be cancelled out by not having to remember to take them I was wrong Within the first month I had literally NO sex drive Within the second month I became INSANE The mood changes had me crying daily and arguing with everyone around me I also started a light period that lasted for the next two months off and on The worst part about it was that when I decided to not get the shot again the side effects last for at least another months or more Plus I ended up gaining within the three month period about pounds Worse decision I ever made My gyno tried to warn me about it but I didnt listen Seriously consider the pros and cons of this
661,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40852,9,Im and have been on Depo for about years Yes I get moody but I have a mood disorder so it could be that Yes I break out but its not absolutely horrible and I kind of always have had acne I think I may have spotted a couple of times but only for a couple of days so far Unsure about bone density since I havent had a test done yet I love not having a period or having to remember to take something more often than every months I think its important to keep on schedule with it none of this off and on stuff No weight gain at all on it Definitely no lowered sex drive Only complaint it can be scary not getting your period But you can always take a test Also remember its different for everyone
662,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,6,40846,3,I havent gotten my period in a year I got my first period when I was and I was a regular until I turned Im now I was taking this medication mg daily for days I finished them yesterday My Doctor said I was supposed to get my period around the seventh day I still havent gotten it but Im hopeful because I have leg pain and my breast are tender since yesterday those are signs I usually get before my period
664,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40836,21,Ive been on the Depo shot for a yr and a half now and I have been bleeding ever since I took it I have experienced a lot of weight gain and depression and tons of moods swings You get cramps everyday as if you just got your period I wouldnt recommend it if you dont like bleeding Might work for some people but not for me
665,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,7,40835,22,I gave it a out of because I didnt experience any side effects so that is great and I havent gotten my period YET I took Provera for days and this is my nd day off of it I feel something going on in there so I have a feeling Aunt Flo will be visiting soon then I get to take my Clomid
667,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40823,6,This shot has caused numbing of my writing arm I am chronically fatigued All I want to do is sleep My appetite is enraged and I am having to be very careful about what I eat as I have already gained six pounds I am worried that the fatigue is permanent as other women I have come across have permanent chronic fatigue
669,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,40817,15,Ive had endometriosis for over years and have had about enough of the pain and the accompanying anemia from blood loss In the last years my blood loss from the endometriosis has increased tenfold and I have developed severe iron deficiency anemia My OBGYN and I decided to try Depo again last time was in the early s and I had my first shot in July of August was HEAVEN No period and my iron levels tested almost normal I was human again Now its September and I have had a quotperiodquot in quotes because its more like a normal womans period for over days and I feel like I have been hit by a Mac truck No endometriosis pain but my iron levels are so low from bleeding that all I can do is sleep When it works its fantastic
670,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40815,5,I was on Depo for years Zero periods in that time I did have a bone density scan after years and that checked out fine I went off of the shot one year ago It took me about months to get a period and now it seems my body is making up for years of missed ones I have had some serious hormonal swings over the past year but overall the period is the only thing I can see that is different I am ready to go back on Depo until menopause
671,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,40812,18,Ive only taken one shot it has been somewhat of a last ditch effort to provide some pain relief from endometriosis and polycystic ovaries The first month was great no pain and very little spotting The second month has been horrible I had a period for weeks and the other I had spotting along with horrible at times pain that even Lortab wont fully control Doctor gave me estrogen to stop bleeding and that took a week As of now I am not taking another shot I told my husband that I can feel this bad for free If this third month goes okay I may reconsider Ive tried everything and its badlooks like hysterectomy is next step
672,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,40806,2,I just recently got on the shot I had unprotected sex within the third week prior I havent started my period and its scaring me a bit Ever since I got on the shot Ive realized Ive had multiple nose bleeds Im not sure if this is from the shot My sex drive hasnt decreased a bit But I seem to be drier than before
675,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,39886,105,I am a year old female In January I had a light period that lasted for days and then stopped Five days later I started bleeding again I had such a heavy flow with clotting that I had to change every hours After the th day I began to get very weak My mother convinced me that this was not normal and to see a gynecologist On day of this heavy bleeding I went to the gynecologist She told me I was going through menopause and prescribed Provera On the next day I was to take mg for days After days I stopped bleeding On day my doctor told me I needed to do this for the next months and each month would get better and it would help me through menopause I do not feel good at all when I take the Provera
676,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,3,39877,21,I had extreme nausea and vomiting within a week of getting my first and ONLY shot of DepoProvera
677,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,39865,16,I was on Depo for about months and started having a period for months on end Im also a kidney failure patient so that doesnt help things But everyone I talk to says they have a period for a long time
678,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39850,43,I have used DepoProvera since I was It started to control my period as it was irregular and ended up years later as birth control I have never had a period since my first injection also never had any side effects This is an awesome idea for someone who is irregular or just hates that time of the month The only bad side to this medicine is I have lost a lot of bone density in the years I have used it My advice is take lots of calcium while using this drug Other then that its great and I have recommended it to others in my years of using it and will continue to
681,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,39824,45,I have used Depo for years for Birth Control and to help with other uterine issues heavy bleeding etc I have never had side effects and its wonderfulno periods Talk about convenient Ill never switch
682,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,39819,107,I have not had a period from the first shot I had ZERO side effects and lost lbs I think it is an amazing product
683,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,39801,79,I took Provera about two years ago for days and it worked great for me I also had to take Clomid on day of my cycle and got pregnant on my third cycle They both worked amazingly I am now going to try again hoping to have the same luck
686,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,39778,58,I took Provera for days as per doctors order to induce a period On the th day I had a period The medication works alright I didnt experience any side effects
688,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,39743,67,Medication works by inducing a period After taking this medicine I had to take clomid and I conceived on my th round of medication It works Be patient and good things will come I am now trying again to conceive and yes I am taking provera again and I just started my st round of clomid
689,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39632,6,Best birth control I have ever had
690,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,39515,252,I had abnormal uterine bleeding and I didnt know why I started passing clots amp was bleeding irregularly I thought at first that I was having a miscarriage I went to my GYN She prescribed Provera mg once a day for days I just finished my prescription amp the only problem that Im having now is sensitive breast Other than that my bleeding has completely stopped
691,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,40417,11,I gained a few pounds on the Depo shot but that wasnt too bad Was on it for years The first years were great although I had a decreased sex drive and the shots left my arm sore for days Had about week long period just before getting the next shot so about every months Bled almost constantly the last months
693,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40388,10,Love it It eliminated my periods for months and I clocked in regularly every months something that never happened in my life I would have stayed on it if it wasnt that I needed a pill with estrogens I had no side effect at all
694,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40350,5,Im getting close to the end of my second year on this birth control I have to switch because of the bone density thing but Ive taken calcium supplements the whole time so I dont believe my bone density was affected much if at all but thats just speculation I did gain a little weight in the last year but I was also in my freshman year in college so it may have just been my lifestyle change After a few months on the shot I stopped getting periods completely not even any spotting This may worry some people but I got used to it I have zero complaints for this birth control method overall
695,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,4,40278,26,I am now taking Provera for the rd time It works but I have had some extra hair growth on my stomach but I am willing to deal with that because I have been trying to conceive for years After I get my period under control I will start taking Clomid My husband and I are praying this time it will work
696,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40272,1,I love my Depo shot I looked forward to getting it every three months I am and I hate taking pills so my doctor told me to try Depo My periods are really painful sometimes and bleeding usually lasts for two weeks but its worth it The only downer is you can only have it for two years because of bone density loss I hate having to find another one like it
699,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,40245,14,I guess the only advice I have is for everyone on or considering this medication to weigh the pros and cons Ive been on the shot for years now and have recently had to have my frequency increased to every weeks versus the normal My cycle completely stopped weeks after my first injection I have only had a few breakthrough bleeds which have been treated with antiinflammatory drugs or and additional dose of the Depo I have had some side effects Ive gained about pounds but it showed up quotin the right placesquot I get very moody occasionally but Ill take that over amenorrhea any day
704,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40193,3,I got my first shot back in October and will not be getting another Since the day I got the shot I have been suffering from mood swings increased appetite I only gained lbs but it was in good places severe cramps bloating and headaches during my cycle or the week right before it would come on Many people I know who have been on the shot said that they had no period at all but everyone reacts differently to different drugs DO AS MUCH RESEARCH AS POSSIBLE AND ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS WITH YOU DOCTOR AND IF NEEDED GET A SECOND OPINION
705,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,3,40185,67,I was very unhappy on this drug My pain was not reduced as it should have been I spotted for the entire months I was on it I was extremely depressed had no libido whatsoever and gained pounds This did not work well for me for this condition at all Unfortunately once it is in your system you are stuck with it It took a full year for my body to readjust once I was off it and to stop spotting It was also hard to lose that weight afterwards
706,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40163,60,I have been on Depo Provera for about years and Ive loved it I havent had any cramps but I do spot for a couple weeks before my shot is due I never gained weight although I should note that I have a very high metabolism However my doctor recently had me do a bone density test and the results were not good Im and my bone density levels were very close to those with osteoporosis Studies show this is reversible once you are off the shot however the studies are not clear about the long term effects So unfortunately my doctor no longer wants me on the shot and I am currently looking into another form of birth control
707,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40162,1,Ive had the shot for a little over years now and I love it Only spotted for the first or months then every once in awhile after that It sucked while it was going on but it was definitely worth it I havent had a real period since the day I started no cramps or any symptoms of that at all Did gain about lbs Within the first year that was the worst part about it then I stopped gaining weight but no matter what I cant get the weight off at all Noticed really bad migraines about years into it Dont if it has anything to do with it Doctors dont have any idea why I get them but maybe thats why Other than that I love it dont have to worry about it except once every months
708,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,40161,71,Worked just like the Dr said I had been bleeding for months without stopping Took Provera for weeks and then started bleeding very heavily Bled for almost more weeks and have now completely stopped bleeding Just started taking Provera again for nd month It makes me a little sleepy and dizzy but it is well worth it to get my bleeding regulated
710,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,40136,4,Ive been on the shot for about years on and off What I mean by on and off is that I take about shots instead of shots a year I started doing this because after the st year of being on the shot I found out I had precancerous cells in my cervix Not positive that the shot caused this but I give my body a break for several months before I start again Every time I start the cycle again I get a different sideeffects I usually have a very high sex drive during the st month and I always have acne always have mood swings and depression sometimes I get headaches and I gain weight continuously regardless of diet and exercise
711,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,40124,17,Ive been on the DepoProvera injection since the inception of offlabel use for Endometriosis For the last few years Ive started having some side effects over the two four weeks prior to each injection including severe fatigue and hot flashes Ill take those side effects any day compared to how I lived when my quotEndoquot ruled my day to day life Ive been pain free for years as a result of the years of Depo injections Other side effects I guess we will see
713,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40116,1,Been on the shot for yrs Doctor told me Ive been on it to long so I didnt get my last shot in July still waiting for my period and they dont know what to tell me when I ask how long Never had acne before now I do and definitely gained weight As a birth control I love it Never had a period and dont remember to have to take daily pill
714,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40115,47,I am years old and I have had jabs of the depo in the last year and a bitMY PROS No period pain every month No babies three is enough for us No worries about tampons etc My CONS headaches alot Mood swings am a little depressed and snappy at the kids I dont want to get intimate with my poor husband at all and my face is covered in acne not really but for me YES I have gained weight kg I was supposed to have my next jab in June this year and I didnt go for it and I still dont have my period months later I think for me personally It is no good
716,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40664,1,I cant rate this a because it is DEFINITELY not perfect No birth control method is However I enjoy being on it What I like about Depo Provera is that its a shot I have to get every months its GREAT not having to worry about birth control inbetween shots I dont have to swallow or insert anything or worry about not taking it on time For me it also stops periods which is the number reason I love it the number reason being that its very effective at preventing pregnancy I got my first Depo Provera shot when I was to stop periods I kept bleeding and spotting and was told that would eventually go away by the nd or rd shot That didnt bother me
717,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40660,1,I was on DepoProvera shot for years straight I came off it for a couple of months but I went back on it again It was of great convenience because I did not have to worry about taking an oral contraception and to just remember to get the jab every months Thats what lured me into getting it in the first place I will admit that it was an excellent form of contraception as it stops you ovulating My periods stopped completely I didnt get spotting or anything maybe I was a lucky few but there was some side effects that my body and mind did not like I gained a lot of weight three stones and I had really bad mood swings when I was on it and they just were not getting any better so I decided to come off it December
718,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,40659,3,I started using Depo when I was and was on it for about or so years and again awhile later I loved it had no periods no side effects no increase in acne I didnt gain weight until I started it again around the time I turned and I think it was just the birthday not the Depo and stopped taking it around Now I am and started again I am on my first month injection and my hormones have been absolutely nuts I am driving my boyfriend insane crying and complaining all the time about nothing really I am halfway through this cycle and WILL NOT be getting another injection Over the last month I feel like a completely different person
719,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40658,3,When on the shot I experience excessive hair loss and a low sex drive
721,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40650,3,My experience with DepoProvera was horrible I had horrible mood swings and I spotted the entire months until the shot left my system Then my period didnt show up for months My face started breaking out not badly but enough for people to notice I also developed cysts on my ovaries that began rupturing and was put in the hospital for them It has been almost a year and my face is finally starting to clear up But I didnt get pregnantso I guess that is one advantage
722,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,40648,2,I have been getting the shot since having my rd baby months ago Honestly the st year was awesome No periods no mood swings and no weight gain Actually improved my moods and I lost all my baby weight right away I was also breastfeeding at the time As soon as I stopped when my son was mos old I guess the hormones in my body changed and reacted differently with the shot I started bleeding for weeks at a time I would bleed light to moderate for about weeks and then stop for about weeks and start up again Ive now gained about lbs and Im starting to break out a bit and I never break out Also my moods are definitely off I can really feel the difference Up and down all the time It was great while it lasted
723,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40637,2,I have been on Depo for yrs I loved it the whole time but during this last year my hair started falling out I started to get bad cramps each month with no bleeding and my breasts became very tender and painful also I was not aware of the bone mass loss doctor never advised so now I have to get a bone density test
724,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40635,0,I had been getting the Depo shot for about a year I decided a few weeks ago that I no longer wanted this as my method of birth control When I first started getting the shot I had some spotting and no periods This has slowly increased and for the past two months I have had spotting everyday I thought I could put up with it before I realized that my libido had been slowly decreasing as well And for the past month or month and a half my sex drive has been virtually nonexistent I was not able to quotget in the moodquot No weight gain
725,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,40625,32,I am years old and I took Provera for days twice a day starting March th mg It worked for me About days after I ended the Provera my period showed up I am trying to conceive with my fiance but first I need my period under control I hope this all works out So far so good
727,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,40620,1,I loved DepoProvera while I was on it but coming off of it has been hard I suffered from depression and weight gain while I was coming off of it
728,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40619,5,I got my first shot in August and I didnt get my period until late October right before my second shot It is now March and I have not stopped bleeding since October Thats like six months The Depo has also made me gain twenty pounds and I have acne as well
730,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40611,2,The first few weeks after my first shot were great I didnt have any side effects My period came two weeks late the first month and after that all hell broke loose My period lasted ten days and ever since O have had a brown discharge It hasnt stopped in two months I also have horrible mood swings now I havent gained weight and not having to take a pill everyday is really convenient but overall it isnt worth it
732,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,40577,3,I got my first shot weeks after delivery I didnt have a period for a while but when I did come on I bled non stop I am still bleeding today which will make it days Although my bleeding has been light I am still adapting to being on my period everyday I was told that I could bleed for up to months I am just ready for this to be done and over with But on the pro sidemy cramps have lessened which is a good thing considering I usually have a hard time when its that time of the month
733,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,40566,60,I started taking Provera January th because I had different periods in the month of December regular change every hrs to light barely noticed it changed every hrs to extremely heavy with huge clots literally changed everytime I stood up because there would be a gush of blood I was told to take it for about weeks and that I would have a period afterwards I stopped bleeding but I got my period a couple of days before the weeks were up The side effects Ive had are nausea seriously sick to my stomach the mere thought of food almost made me regurgitate and my body was extremely sore and it made me tired I still have pills and honestly not sure if I should still be taking it but I guess the pills work
734,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40565,10,Im and took one shot back in October my husband and I decided on trying for a baby within the next year so I did go for the second shot in December The first month was great but ever since then I will go almost a month bleeding off a week or so then another month and I have the worst cramps ever I am just now starting to get over the mood swings and depression My face broke out bad clearing up now I also gained Ibs and I know that was from the shot because I eat right and exercise I will never take this again and will never recommend it to anyone Now hopefully it will hurry and be completely out of my system so we can start making babies
738,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,40468,2,Im on the third shot of DepoProvera I have no more periods but the side effects right now are horrible I have headaches my stomach is hurting painfully most of my time Ive been having hot flashes I did get dizzy yesterday But I havent gained any weight in fact Ive lost pounds but my only concern is my stomach pain it gives me nausea I never vomit I only feel like it Its huge cramping and sometimes bloating
739,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40449,1,I have been on Depo for years now I had about a month of spotting when I got my st injection but I have since stopped having periods altogether It has NOT affected my sex drive I have gained a little weight but that could also just be the fact that my metabolism has slowed since Im getting older In the last year I have had a little bone loss and my doctor now wants me to switch to something else She has suggested Implanon Wish I could just stay on Depo
743,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,40793,18,The first three months went alright I was quite moody and emotional but nothing more than how I am when I get PMS It was bearable and didnt last too long I had one period for two weeks After taking the second shot I have had a period for over a month and a half now an actual heavy period not spotting My acne has gotten worse Im definitely switching to the pill when I am ready to get my next shot
744,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40791,3,I have been using this method of Birth Control for over ten years now I am hesitant to change to another form I have not had a period since starting Depo and never had a pregnancy scare I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise I would recommend this form of birth control for anyone who cannot remember to take a pill or who does not want to worry about getting pregnant Once every three months is easy to do and I have never been happier with any form of birth control
746,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40774,1,I have been getting the Deposhot since and its been great I stopped having periods since the first dose which was a plus for me because I get really sick I didnt gain weight The only thing is that the shot is very painful but I will continue to use it for as long as I can Its very effective for birth control
748,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,1,40758,21,Did not work for me Secondary amenorrhea no period for months Age
749,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40758,5,I have been on DepoProvera for shots year and I have had relatively little side effects Before Depo I was on regular OrthoTricyclen pills and Ortho Lo On both previous methods I definitely gained weight at least pounds and was moody with total lack of libido I also got headaches a lot not really bad ones but annoying enough When I went back to get my prescription refilled I told the doctor about the headaches and that one of my eyes was becoming slightly nearsighted From these two factors she recommended the shot rather than the pill I had slight spotting then periods were gone after nd shot no headaches small weight gain and still less interested in sex than I would like to be but no birth control is perfect Try it
751,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40750,4,When I first started the shot everything was great I wasnt bleeding it worked as a birth control Then a month later I started bleeding heavily I bled for the entire month and longerI also suffer from bipolar disorder and this shot only enhanced both my manic and depression episodes I became extremely irritable erratic and finally I became suicidal After being hospitalized my doctor expressed concern that the shot had worsened everything If you suffer from any mood or anxiety disorder I strongly caution you against using this form of birth control I have used the pill before and never suffered such severe side effects with my mood
752,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40750,16,While it did prevent pregnancy while I was using it it has also stolen every bit of desire for sex I once had putting a huge strain on my marriage
755,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,8,40715,8,I was prescribed Provera mg days due to not having a period for several years and so my husband and I can have a baby Works like a charm Started period days after taking last pill st day was mild flow and all subsequent days were extremely heavy Its now day of having a period which is not normal for me even when I had periods and continue to have extremely heavy flow I will be calling my doctors office today as I do not want this to continue The upside is I did not experience any side effects while taking the medicine
756,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40710,3,I do not recommend getting this for your teenage daughter When I was a teenager It made me very moody and would get so so upset over the smallest things Now I am watching my teenage step daughter use it and she is the same way I am and have been on it for two years now and I finally stopped bleeding and spotting I have noticed its giving me muffin top and I am thin I am switching to the Implanon next week because my doctor recommended that instead of a tubal ligation I am nervous but so far I heard Implanon is the best birth control
757,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40708,3,Works as birth control but for me the side effects were completely too much to handle Had my first shot about months ago and all was okay for the first month or so But since then I have had almost no sex drive constant breakouts and for the past weeks or so Ive had my period with severe cramping Making an appointment today to see about switching to the patch
759,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,40700,34,years old have been on DepoProvera for about years now due to terrible awful debilitating periods the kind that made it hard for me to go to work I did get spotting the first few months but after that it was FREEDOM No periods whatsoever I didnt have any weight gain still around lbs and no other problems Im going to get NovaSure soon because I dont want to have to bother going to the pharmacy every three months and Im worried about the whole bone density thing although my doctor said she was on Depo for years without any problems I would recommend this for anyone who wants a longterm but temporary way to get rid of periods Dont suffer
762,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40684,7,I have been on the Depo shot since April I actually got it the day after giving birth to my daughter Ive been spotting for a year now and still is Ive gained at least lbs I have no sex drive and I have lost about inches of my hair The only good thing is it does prevent pregnancy but thats about it Definitely switching to something else
763,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40681,2,I have polycystic ovarian syndrome I have been using Depo since I was and I am now Even when I took the pill which regulated my periods my periods were abnormally heavy and I did not want to deal with it I like using Depo a lot I have taken a bone density test about months ago and my bones were great you just have to make sure you are taking calcium and vitamin D The only negative side of using Depo for me are the mood swings that happen after I get the shot and last for about a week or two I dont get any other PMS symptoms and I have NEVER spotted ALTHOUGH this is important DO NOT be late on taking your shot I did that ONCE and I had my period
765,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40665,2,This is a great birth control for most people I very rarely get my period and if I do its like about every months and its only spotting You dont have to worry about waking up everyday and remembering to take a pill I love this shot and I recommended it to a friend She didnt have the same experience as I did I love this product So all Im saying is everyone is different
766,Phenylephrine,Eye Redness,10,42477,0,Best eye drop I ever tried Provided soothing relief with NO side effects whatsoever Shame that it is no longer available
767,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42462,28,Really not sure why my urologist gave me samples of this drug since my prostate was normal for my age and my PSA was normal I was not having issues peeing just some discomfort Anyway I tried the pills for four days Nothing changed because I was still up times per night like I have for years Butthe side effects were immediate Stuffy head headaches and no ejaculate Not a drop Freaked me out Erection was not as strong and the quotclimaxquot took longer to reach and was literally a split second If you still enjoy sex steer clear of this drug Im am stopping immediately and will not return to that doctor As far as Im concerned I paid for nothing
768,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,42431,18,It reduces urination frequency but has a very negative affect on my sex life Im going to have to stop using it
773,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,4,42266,21,Having trouble emptying bladder so doc gave Rapaflo samples Increased flow within days but still difficulty emptying completely No ejaculate at all but orgasim still there Will stop Rapaflo regimen and try disposable caths for awhile
777,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42137,44,Im and have had weak flow for years It seems Ive tried every drug available but not much relief First dose of Rapaflo gave noticeable improvement within hours I thought I had found the solution until the diarrhea started Cut the dose to the mg capsule once per day and diarrhea solved but sexual problems set in No ejaculation Judging from this site this is not a minor side effect but almost a guarantee After a few weeks I began to have increasing difficulty reaching orgasm at all My sex life is fading fast Rated for effectiveness and for side effects
779,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42075,34,I am a year old married man I started on Rapaflo months ago It seems to have reduced my urination trips at night from about to or I can still have an orgasm but I have to focus harder and the subsequent ejaculation is dry Something I have never experienced before It does seem to be very expensive at for a day supply
780,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,42072,34,Prescribed by Urologist with samples for trial Found negligible benefit for the intended purpose very weak urine flow but severe interference with sexual fulfillment and inordinately high price I quit after six weeks
781,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,42057,37,I am a year old man who suffers from benign prostate hyperplasia I had to urinate to times every night My family doctor put me on Rapaflo It worked immediately now I have to urinate only once or twice at night It depends on how much liquid I drank The main side effect is that there is no ejaculation at all
785,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,41825,77,Fifty six year old male Obese but otherwise healthy Rapaflo mg once a day for symptom associated with BPH Rapaflo efficacy is measurably effective Serious downside is decreased ejaculation intensity AND retrograde ejaculation Dry as a bone Talk about affecting quality of life
786,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,41823,63,Started taking Rapaflo about a month ago after experiencing horrible side effects with Flomax I find that it only works well if I take it every few days and then it only works for about hours Taking it every day does nothing for me after the first hours However when it does work it reduces my nightly urinations from to about doubling my sleep The ejaculation side effect is completely awful though
787,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41816,82,Im years old and was diagnosed with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia last year I was my Urologists youngest patient BPH was so bad I was not emptying my bladder and was getting up at times per night It made work and home life miserable I had the TURP surgery coupled with a daily dose of Rapaflo and I cannot believe the results If I get up once during the night thats a lot Nowfor the side effectsIm not too pleased with them at all I have a very active sex life with a high drive While Im able to have an awesome erection and orgasm I cannot ejaculate whatsoever
788,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,41798,51,I have been on Rapaflo for months Results are mixed some nights Im up only once and others several times Consuming liquids in the evening makes little difference Sexually the only change is no ejaculation which is OK I guess but not great Dr recommends Avodart but the side effects of that medicine are serious in my opinion erectile dysfunction swollen breasts loss of sexual interest Not going there
790,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41710,48,Just started this and like it so far I keep waking up with morning wood and my erections are harder then normal Urine flow is slightly better and bathroom trips are less
791,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41644,58,Have been taking an mg dose prebedtime for the past days Symptoms of weak flow and seemingly incomplete voiding improved markedly within hours Only though significant side effect is retrograde ejaculation of which I had been forewarned but had never been previously aware Doesnt seem to make a great difference to the sensual experience while providing builtin birth control
792,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,39914,81,I like it because so far it has improved my flow over the rest of the medications on the market
793,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,40925,52,Yes it helped my urinary flow but the dry ejaculation and lower sex drive are a deal breaker for me Im going back to Flomax or using nothing I really like sex
794,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,40900,48,I have a somewhat enlarged prostate and was diagnosed with prostate cancer five years ago following an initial biopsy Three successive biopsies over the years have not shown any cancer However my bladder has apparently not been voiding as it should and after my last visit to my doctor I was put on a day trial of Rapaflo It has been moderately successful but not so overwhelming that I think I will stay on it I have had some slight dizzinessas well as no ejaculate and a slight decline in orgasm sensation Since I am still in my mids I would like to continue to have sexual relations that include ejaculations and a more intense orgasm I am assuming those sensations are a result of the Rapaflo
795,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,40892,66,GENTLEMEN YOU HAVE TO SHRINK YOUR PROSTATE Ive used Rapaflo for abouts months now Stops my urethra infections and gives strong stream Take it in combination with Avodart I couldnt grip my penis good to pee straight it was so small from lack of blood flow Yes there was retrograde ejaculation However you want to win the war Reduced prostate size and maintenance not a battle Im better than I was
798,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,40801,52,Doctor did not warn about the dry ejaculate so I was really spooked that maybe my system had shut down until I googled about it Otherwise the medicine did exactly what was needed Im and got a mysterious prostrate infection I did have to be at home with a catheter for days waiting for the Cipro to treat the infection and Rapaflo to let me pee Apparently good results based on the time I dropped my drawers for more strangers that week than anytime since college and was glad to do it
799,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,40784,28,Worked within first to hours Dry ejaculation stuffy nose feeling is better on my second week
800,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,40757,47,Rapaflo works great for me No really significant side effects Dont have the sex anymore just a wonderful understanding wife Sex is not everything I would rather have the flow
802,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,4,40712,22,Improved Benign Prostate Hyperplasia but not dramatically Side effect no semen when ejaculating
805,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,40579,58,Found Rapaflow impossible to tolerate bloating severe congestion very dry mouth tongue like sandpaper horrible sexual side effects no desire and no ejaculate Stopped after a weak It did not improve my symptoms at all anyway
806,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,40450,38,Rapaflo works just as well as Flomax in terms of flow and I dont get as dizzy or conjested It felt weird having no ejaculate and my orgasm was not as intenseas it was with Flomax
807,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,40437,36,Rapaflo has given me a very nice stream and taken away the pressure I dont mind not ejaculating its worth the flow My frequency and urgency are not improved close to months after starting Get up at night less Hoping to try it during the day instead of at night or increase dosage by mg
808,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,40388,59,Started Rapaflo three days ago Stream improved after first day Retrograde ejaculation today Some stuffy nose and some bloating stomach pain in evening Debating whether to continue Generally dont like medicines and do not take anything else Would like to have Benign Prostate Hyperplasia corrected surgically but am afraid Will give the medicine a little longer before deciding next course of action
809,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,40331,56,Patient age Have taken Flomax intermittenly for two years Urologist switched me to Rapaflo to improve urination and split stream No significant improvement for flow or split stream Within two weeks all ejaculate stopped Completely dry climax Discontinuing Rapaflo hoping ejaculation will return
810,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,40323,114,yrs old with moderate urinary difficulty up a couple of times a night Tried Flomax for a few months but did not like the stuffy nose light headedness sore muscles and crazy dreams Now taking Rapaflo with only slight stuffiness Seems to work consistently well It does cause complete anejaculation no ejaculation slight to somewhat diminished climax remains which feels a little strange but okay Overall Rapaflo works well and the pluses outweigh the minuses much better for me than Flomax
811,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,40320,62,Was using Uroxatral Rapaflo seems to work about as well but I also have experienced very little or no ejaculation very strange sensation
815,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,40027,46,Rapaflo has worked great for me I used to use Flomax and my doctor switched me I feel so much better and dont have the dizziness I used to have with Flomax
816,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,39949,59,I had been using Flomax for the past years and my urologist suggested I try this new medicine Rapaflo Well I took it for days and it became very difficult to urinate so I switched back to Flomax and all is flowing well again
817,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,39932,75,I am and have taken this for two weeks It has improved my urinary symptoms but has caused a side effect that I am not pleased with retrograde ejaculation
818,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,41585,41,Ive been taking Rapaflo for one week now wo any adverse side effects Rapaflo worked immediately to mitigate nightly trips to the bathroom I nowmake one or two trips and the flow is significantly much stronger than previously The only negative is that my PDP doesnt cover Rapaflo
819,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41568,86,I can only say it will make urination easier but it also will make a satisfying climax with ejaculation a fond distant memory IT TAKES A LONG time to wear off so you dont need to take it daily
820,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,41564,59,I started Rapaflo mg yesterday afternoon after my urology appointment Got up to urinate only once last night down from times a night I am impressed at how quotrapidquot it worked Stream is already stronger Orgasm last evening was same in intensity but produced nothing This really surprised me as I did not know it was a side effect Just hope intensity and drive dont decrease as well
822,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41539,65,Started to work immediately to improve urine flow and frequency However the side effect of retrograde ejaculation became extremely bothersome I did stop taking it for a few weeks and the side effect was completely reversed however the urine flow issue was too much of a problem so I restarted taking the Rapaflo again Same issues which I tolerated for a while but finally decided to go back to the Urologist and he started me on a new medicine
823,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,41515,63,Difficulty urinating Given a sample of Rapaflo by my urologist and warned about possible side effects no ejaculation Have been experiencing mucous and coughing and learned that this may be another side effect Flow is much better and if you can get over the need to ejaculate the medicine seems to achieve required resultsUsed Flomax for a kidney stone in the past with success but only short term One incident of bladder infection which was treated with Cipro by my family doctorAny idea what to do about the stuffiness or must I live with it Also on Lipitor and blood pressure lowering medicines cautioned the Rapaflo in conjunction with it might cause dizziness but it hasnt yet
824,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41509,24,Had symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia then a stone popped out Had both Rapaflo and Flomax on hand so I took the Flomax Great within hours and for the first few weeks then start with blood pressure issues I also take Avapro as a preventative to blown kidneys from being diabetic so they can BOTH lower blood pressure which it seems all of these medicines CAN do Not sure if I have a full blown case of BPH OR a moving stone as it comes and goes on its own and I never have night up and down issues Mine is what seems like unable to fully empty full bladder and then drip drip drip drip Flomax works within hours on me but long term has problems with the fast pulse Thinking of trying Rapaflo instead of Flomax when it flares up
826,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,41479,0,I am and have an enlarged prostate x taking Finasteride and have tried Flowmax and Alfuzosin The main side effect that is driving me crazy is Hyperacusis My doctor switched me to Silodosin and as usual it helped in all expected ways but still the Hyperacusis comes back Loud noises make me extremely nervous and it is difficult to be around people I may have to have the TURP surgery as I can not tolerate the side effects especially the HyperacusisNo one seems to have this particular problem but people as I do experience the throat and nasal symptoms I can tolerate the dry ejaculations but not the others I am considering going to a mg dose It does provide adequate flow
827,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,41454,49,Ive had a weak stream for some time but after a recent prostate biopsy I had extra trouble voiding Actually I was just dribbling and couldnt even get up a good stream In the mornings I wasnt sure I would be able to urinate at all After one day I noticed I was getting a little bit better flow but it immediately causes dry ejaculation I took a second day and developed a headache which carried into the third day This morning I was so tired and lethargic I lay in bed till noon I decided at this point that I would get off it and see if my energy comes back I believe I will have to opt for surgery and get this fixed
829,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41370,60,The lack of semen freaked me at first but I got over it its like having a vasectomy my friends tell me But my erections are just as strong and my orgasms are better
832,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,41307,68,I have a prostate infection with an enlarged prostate and urinary issues I was given Flomax days initially with antibiotics but the Flomax made me dizzy and a bad stuffed up nose I was then given Rapaflo to help treat the benign prostate hyperplasia and felt only a slight stuffy nose and of course the most common side effect no ejaculation These side effects are common This medication is important in treating BPH and infections I now have no discomfort and urinate freely I still have two weeks to go I wont stop taking it until the days are up per doctors ordersFor those people who are worried about the no ejaculation side effect I have to say stick through and win the war It will come back Skipping or less sex for a month is worth it to get back to normal
835,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,41098,34,For me it works fair At certain times of the day I still have difficulty starting the urine stream I am sure I will have to have surgery before long
838,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,3,41057,60,To make a long story short Rapaflo worked making it easier to urinate and cutting the frequency in half However if you still enjoy Sex well there wont be any You can forget having any meaningful ejaculation After taking it for less than a week there was absolutely no ejaculate The frustration of trying to have sex is worst than the frequent urination to me So if your not interested in Sex its a good drug and it works well with little or no other side effects I also tried Flowmax and its merely a little brother to Rapaflo with pronounced Dizziness and muscle fatigue Neither is realistic for me But give them a try they make work better for you
843,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,43024,2,Seemed to work for about two weeks then wore off andsymptoms returned I would of had to stop takinganyway due to unbelievable nasal congestion Tried to stick with it for more weeks but since I could not breath throughmy nose had trouble with sleep also Also no sperm at allTwo weeks after stopping still some nasal congestion
844,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42927,0,I was facing difficulties in urination Every min there is urge of urination but only little urine passes All reports were normal Still my docter advised me to take silodocin and levofloxacinNow my experience both medicine have very bad side effects especially silodocin The main side effect is retrograde ejaculation I have taken only dose of both I dont know about the side effect of medicine so I was really very scared After discontinuation silodocin it took hour to go away retrograde ejaculation
846,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42837,1,I was having very frequent urination and some discomfort in my kidneys so I consulted the urologist he diagnosed me with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and no problem in kidneys and prescribed silodal silodosin capsules mg After few days the frequency of urination reduced however I am experiencing Retrograde Ejaculation and not a single drop of semen is released during sex I am quite scared and concerned about the impact of his drug on my fertilityI am stopping this medicine immediately I want this serious side effect to be mentioned on the medicine in bold and should be told to all patients who visit the doctor and prescribed with this drug
847,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,42831,20,Best drug out there for improvement in stream Worst drug out there for retrograde ejaculation and orgasm buzz killer
850,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42780,10,hrs old I started taking Flomax for BPH It completely blocked my sinus So I asked for something different My urologist prescribed Rapaflo but they blocked sinus was even worse and it cost me for pills Horrible medicine Avoid at all costs
852,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42773,8,I have just read through most of the comments here and find them accurate about the sideeffects no ejaculate while on it but stopping the drug ends that problem after a little while I had a procedure called Urolift where my urologist with local anesthesia inserted tiny devices that open up the urethra like shoring up a tunnel to create more flow During the operation in his office and while awake one of the little clips didnt attach fully and when I urinated a few days later it came out OUCH After that no more pain from it traveling out but lots of bloody urine for a few days Bottom line the procedure worked out well even with three of them implanted It has been a year and just had bladder infection cured with Cipro
853,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42716,17,For me it works well with some caveats Take it for too long and its effectiveness wanes around the week mark However when you go back it works in full force again I also noticed it was not needed EVERY day either skipping days worked pretty well too the second day just had a much lesser effect but still there Sexual effects YUP No ejaculate reduced drive All that This is not a big deal to me I am and my wife works the opposite shift from me during the week so sex isnt happening anyway When you stop taking them hrs later your back to normal So I just typically take them on weekDAYS and deal with poor urine flow on day when sex is a possibility
854,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42694,3,I am yrs old and went for a cystoscopy a week ago This was due to weak urination urgency to go to the loo and not completely emptying my bladder This was for years it was only until this year that it got worsehard to pee After two days in hospital I was prescribed Silodosin The first two nights it made me pee every hour With hardly any sleep I consulted the doctor and he told me to change to taking it at daytime Then the side effects kicked ini felt dizzy pain in lower back chest congestion first constipation and later diarrhea I know this may sound like way too muchhowever i never had this issues before Its making it really difficult to live a normal life I just want to know if anyone else has similar issues
855,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42668,14,After many months I lost my entire sex drive had hair loss very rapid heart beats shortness of breath all over muscle weakness sick to my stomach and rapid weight loss and loss of balance I had to stop driving I caution anyone about how the benefits out way the risks In will never take this ever again
856,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42648,12,Within hour of first dose I like many others on this thread had no ejaculate None It was pretty disconcerting to say the least As far as the BPH goes it worked I just cant justify taking something that ruins sex no matter what the reason
857,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,42641,10,I have BPH and wish to avoid TURP surgery My urologist did ultrascans CT scans nuclear renal scans etc I have urine retention and that has led to one kidney having swelling He ordered intermediate cathing Have been doing that for months now My bladder is voiding to and retention is capped at cc More scans indicate my kidneys are doing fine now I started Rapaflo with Finasteride before cathing It did not help void my bladder So we moved to cathing I have no urge to pee unless my bladder has over cc So Rapaflofinasteride does not seem to be working I do have retrograde ejaculation Surely Rapaflo is causing it Urologist says keeping taking RF as it might take time Meanwhile int cathing is the plan
859,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42609,9,yrs old Had testicular cancer at left testi removed About years after I started having pain in between my scotum and rectum Was diagnosed with prostatitis doc put me on rapaflo Said it could take up to weeks for it to start to work First thing I noticed with in hrs was retrograde ejaculation Vary concerning at first then I read into side effects Thanks doc for not giving any heads up It took me about days befor my pain was lessenedand about weeks befor it was almost gone Now I can get away without taking it for days befor I start getting sorebut its a catch since the timing for me to have a normal ejaculation is about days off the meds days of use is not enough time for it to work prop
860,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,42589,14,yo male Frequent night urination not able to void the bladder completely Doc put me on Rapaflo and the symptoms vanished within hours Able to orgasm but not ejaculate Climax not as strong
861,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42574,19,Fiftynine year old Have taken Rapaflo for several years Diagnosed with BPH I was warned about the lack of ejaculate I was still able to orgasm Then I developed problems with orgasm My urologist said it was either low testosterone levels or psychlogical issues He said the Rapaflo was not causing the problem My prescription plan sent out a letter stating that the cost of Rapaflo would increase dramatically I talked to my urologist and he prescribed the generic Tamsulosin brand namd Flomax I get three months supply at a time I finished out my Rapaflo Then I started taking the Tamsulosin The return to orgasm and ejaculation was not immediate but I and the woman in my life are very estatic with our sex life now
862,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42573,10,I have been getting up times every night and finally decided to try medication again previously tried Flomax which did nothing for me Rapaflo after days gave me only a headache diarrhea and at best a flow increase I still got up several times during the night maybe one less time than previous The side effects and miniscule benefit made it a nobrainer to stop taking this useless medication A waste of
863,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,42546,2,I tried HytrinFlomax then Hytrin again then I tried Silodyx which works well except that no semen is ejaculated sex is normal with shorter orgasms its totally unmessy so my wife is happy
864,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,42546,11,In I was diagnosed with prostate cancer tumors Underwent treatments of radiation My choice over surgery Had shots of Lu pron months apart to kill the testosterone and help the radiation do the job Cancer gone and PSA tests less than ever since Started taking Rapaflo mg every night and it helped me sleep at least or hours without having to get up to the bathroom so often I think the radiation hurt my bladder and the result was frequent urination Anyway to the point The Rapaflo works but I cannot experience a normal ejaculation But when I quit taking the Rapaflo for a week or more I can with ext ream pain both from the penis and the area of the prostate It is a burning sensation Have tried twice
865,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42528,2,Probably the worst medication Ive ever taken It had very little effect on my prostate but gave me swollen sinuses blurry vision fatigue muscular weakness retrograde ejaculation and no ejaculation
866,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,42496,22,Immediate relief Seems to be very long acting I was prescribed Rapaflo mg once daily but seem to need once WEEKY I quickly know that once urine flow becomes a problem its time to take the medication
867,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42464,3,yo male diagnosed with Bladder Outlet Obstruction The doctor put me on Rapaflo as a last medication effort for bladder retention The number of time I have to go during the day has went from to times a day Flow is unbelievably better Like the other reviews have said the main drawback is the retrograde ejaculation The strange thing is it comes and goes depending on the time of day
868,Resorcinol / sulfur,Acne,10,39822,3,Have loved this product since I began using it The price is great
870,Methylin ER,Depression,9,41568,113,Ive been diagnosed with ADD at the age of and have struggled with major depression since adolescence I currently take mg Methylin ER and mg bupropion XL in the morning In the evenings I take mg of trazadone for sleep weeks now and I have never felt better The adjustment period was pretty mild Just a bit jazzed in the morning and very mild nausea in the evening This gradually faded over a week My appetite is returning my diet improving and I am reconnecting sociallyMy sleep is good and I awaken fully alert with the sunriseI cant believe how dramatic this change is I am optimistic that I will be able to dig myself out of the hole Ive been in and rebuild a life
871,Methylin ER,ADHD,8,40974,29,My son yrs old has been taking this for about weeks now for ADD I was apprehensive about resorting to medicating him but as his grades and progress were suffering we felt we had to take the next step and try medication We have noticed a dramatic difference On the nd day his teachers sent me notes about how much he had already improved with focusing on his school work and having to spend much less time getting him to pay attention He is more focused and hasnt brought work home not completed in class since he started it Only one dizzy spell on the nd day of treatment and a little trouble getting to sleep the first nights but now he seems adjusted to the meds and is doing quite well
872,Methylin ER,ADHD,10,40772,11,My son takes this Best medication he has been on that works Just hard to get as its always on back order
873,Methylin ER,Narcolepsy,9,40261,20,I used Methylin ER for months I used the equivalent of a days prescription one mg once a day for months I did not use the pill every day due to illnesses and migraines Who wants to be alert for that When I did take it it was a different life for me I could actually plan what task I would complete that day instead of quotwatch and waitquot as it has always been for me with narcolepsy I am a stay at home mom with a year old and a year old In result my house was cleaner I was more predictable energy wise I did sleep lighter and occasionally woke up at night It was not bothersome though not to stop it Then the unfortunate happened I became allergic to it I am also allergic to Nuvigil and Progvigl
874,Methylin ER,ADHD,9,40106,4,My adult ADHD is the result of a traumatic brain injury This has been helpful with the ADHD but also with other symptoms from the TBI
875,Methylin ER,ADHD,4,39916,15,My doctor recently switched me from Ritalin LA to Methylin ER since it comes in a generic form and is much more affordable Sometimes I cant even tell I have taken the Methylin ER the performance is so substandard to the Ritalin LA
876,Methylin ER,ADHD,10,39837,25,It gave me back a life which I thought I would never have
877,Methylin ER,ADHD,9,39749,24,I was prescribed this for ADHD that was along with bipolar disorder I didnt take it at first cause I was scared because I have a history of substance abuse Finally I decided to give it a try The first day I took it there was a HUGE difference I was not as irritable as usual The quotchatterquot in my head quietened I was able to focus better on a few tasks I felt a little bit more confident than usual So far I havent had any bad things to say I have ECT once a month which helps a little bit with my depression and bipolar but this medication seems to do more good than any of that stuff
878,Methylin ER,ADHD,9,39582,33,I have been on Methylin ER for about a year and a half I still have a lot of difficulty with ADHD symptoms but the medication helps I can tell when I dont take it properly my symptoms increase I have only had to increase the dosage once in about six months I think that I need another increase now I have not had any problems with side effects My appetite is fine no sleep issues if anything I sleep better now no anxiety or increased blood pressure
879,Methylin ER,Depression,10,39528,249,Ive been on antidepressants from the old style to the newer SSRIs SNRIs and others and nothing worked My doctor suggested Methylin ER and my depression lifted in two days and I havent had a relapse Its been about a year now and Im still as happy as can be I dont sleep for hours or more anymore either I can wake fully rested with hours sleep and do anything my heart desires Methylin ER is truly amazing and Ill never go back to an antidepressant as long as this keeps working
881,Clemastine,Allergic Rhinitis,10,40205,11,I have used this medicine for a number of years for allergy and hay fever dust mold pollen etc and find it is quite effective for mild to moderate hay fever symptoms with no noticeable side effects For a long acting OTC remedy its relatively cheap too around for mg tab doses and I take tabsday
882,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41538,53,Between amp years old I suffered frequently with urinary tract infections and was all too familiar with the pain However about years ago I thought I was getting them again but all the cultures were negative for infection and no antibiotic would work When I decided to talk to my OBGYN about my symptoms he immediately mentioned Interstitial Cystitis and I tested positive for it They put me on Elmiron for about months and it cleared it up The only food that bothered me was bananas I recently had the Ablasion procedure which seems to have flared it again so I may have to take Elmiron again It is expensive but worth it to me
883,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41529,40,For years I was in and out of doctors offices explaining to them that I was having severe bladder pain the kind that makes you nauseous sweaty and feverish Finally I went to this one doctor and told her I had symptoms of urinary tract infections times in less than months I had tried changing my diet and nothing had helped She put me on Elmiron mg pills times a day and within weeks I could finally pee It has been amazing although I do suffer from frequent headaches even when we have lowered the dose as low as pills a week and exhaustion I had this before the Elmiron but it has been increased while on it I still recommend trying it it is better than nothing
884,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,41497,46,Ive only been on Elmiron for weeks But I did notice a decrease in symptoms pain is my only real symptom by week Now I am in week and I am almost pain free most of the time I dont stray too far from the diet yet but I do notice I can get away with more foods Id give it a but Im not sure how it will work in the future Doctors say that the sooner you start taking it after symptoms present and the more mild your disease the faster it works and the more beneficial it is My Interstitial Cystitis was considered mild and I was diagnosed within month of symptom onset I hope it continues to work I take mg a day
885,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41182,55,I suffered for many years with painful and frequent urinating I went to many doctors who kept telling me it was a UTI although each time the tests were always negative They kept just saying maybe whatever medications I was taking were probably just counteracting the results I lived on AZO Finally my gynecologist decide to do some other tests and found I had Interstitial Cystitis and this was in I was so relieved to finally have an answer I was then prescribed Elmiron I have been taking it almost years now and its helped me immensely I am still at pills a day some days I can get by with just or pills depending on what I eat and drink And although it is expensive it is so worth it I am just so thankful to be on the right track
886,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41015,62,It takes about days for it to start working and probably days for it to fully work However it does help prevent pain associated with Interstitial Cystitis IC I didnt fully appreciate it until I couldnt afford the medicine anymore If you call the manufacturer they can help you get a discount card to save on the cost
887,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,1,40875,29,Ive had Interstitial Cystitis for yrs Ive had cystoscopy surgeries and bladder tack All to have a diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis I have taken Elmiron on and off for years and I unfortunately do not get much if any relief Im only and fear that I am going be in pain forever
888,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,40836,50,Well it being the only medicine from my problem I felt better after weeks of taking it I had Interstital Cystitis for years I thought it was a urinary tract infection and took too many antibiotics Sadly the pain came back every time I have no side effects from Elmiron it helps me a lot also no weight gain or swelling
890,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,40689,61,Sure glad I researched and found this medicine All others were awful I do warn you though that Elmiron takes about months to work and I have to continue taking it forever I usually give up on medicines if they dont work in a week sure glad I gave this a chance There are zero side effects You must follow directions about taking an hour before eating and you must stay away from alcohol and caffeine religiously I found that if I stay away from irritants I can decrease dose to only one a day but as soon as I have a coke or beer or chocolate I get a flare up for a month or more
891,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,40644,52,My story is a different one I was diagnosed a couple years ago with an overactive bladder the urologist I was using said there was no way I had Interstitial Cystitis I had been doing research but he didnt want to listen Well I suffered for a couple years cause I was having a hard time finding another doctor and then finally just a week ago I found a doctor that listened to my symptoms and without hesitation told me I definitely had IC He put me on Elmiron times a day I know it has not been but a couple days but I feel different My urges arent as bad I am still having pain to some food but I am new to this and will learn I am very happy I finally about almost years of pain found out what was causing it and something to help
892,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,9,40565,39,I have lived with Interstitial Cystitis for decades and this is the only effective medicine that I have found to relieve my quotUTIlikequot symptoms when taken regularly I still have issues with some foods causing irritation of my bladder but for the most part Elmiron helps me not have to watch every little thing I eat
893,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,7,40492,44,I had severe Interstitial Cystitis which I had thought and the doctors I saw thought was an incurable bladder infection For six months I took dose after dose of higher level antibiotics while my IC got worse I also kept drinking cranberry juice and taking cranberry supplements When I finally found a doctor who knew what was wrong I had to start at taking mg a day of Elmiron as well as about bladder washes with heparin a week and I gave up all acidic foods It took about months before I felt better Now I am down to to mg a day I feel great
894,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,5,40416,17,I was diagnosed a few months ago My doctor started me on mg a day and times a week I went in for bladder instillation Soon after it became obvious that I am quite allergic to it I continued to take it with a strong dose of Benadryl but my reactions continued to get worse so I quit taking it about a week agothe symptoms are back Dont know which is worse What else is out there
896,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,40349,0,The only medicine that has managed my Interstitial Cystitis and helped me live a near normal life Without it Id be dead or at least severely incapacitated in a lot of pain and urgency
897,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,6,40310,22,I have had improvement on issues like frequency and pain but the medicine causes fatigue headache nausea weakness and swelling in my limbs
900,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,7,39968,60,I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in February Since that time Ive been taking the prescribed dosage of mg daily This has helped my interstitial cystitis symptoms tremendously I had suffered for a long time before being diagnosed properly so when this medication was presented to me and I took it for a couple of months my pain was gone I was so excited to finally get relief Unfortunately I had a recent blood test to check my liver enzymes The AST was and the ALT was both of which are normal between and My physician wants me to decrease my dosage of Elmiron and check me again in weeks Im very concerned about the high levels of enzymes in my blood Be careful and keep a check on your liver
901,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,39925,66,I have been using Elmiron since February I love it I think I did gain some weight but who cares I did not have as severe a case of interstitial cyctitis as some people but the medicine has sure been a blessing for me I have just recently cut back on it because I believe I have leveled off with the symptoms But just to be safe on that Ill be seeing my Doctor to be sure Dont want any flare ups Ive been able to eat again I eat just about anything I always did Mustard being my favorite Thanks Elmiron for helping me According to what I have read on interstitial cystitis mine is a mild case I do hope Elmiron will help those with a severe case I am so blessed and pray others will be after taking the medicine
906,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,1,42374,38,It took a long time for the doctors to find out what was wrong with be after endless testing and the distention of my bladder i finally got a diagnosis I was put on Elmiron and i took it like told waited the month waiting period for it to workand over a year later it still did nothing All it did was make me so constipated that I would go weeks without a regular bowel movement The only way I could use the bathroom was by using laxatives And the nausea was terrible My hair was weak and broke easily as well as my nails Not only did this medication not work but it caused even more agonizing symptoms
907,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42318,50,Being diagnosed with IC was a life changer I got depressed didnt want to leave my house unless I would be close to a bathroom I would have emergencies at work and get awful flares where I had to see me and get a cocktail which only lasted until I peed it out I have an abnormally small bladder and also urethral structure I have a severe case of the IC and Elmiron saved my life I get a moderate flare here and there if I splurge and have a coffee which use to be my life I dont drink alcohol at anymore Really only water now Spicy foods give me flares But on Elmiron they are tolerable and way less frequent Im so thankful for this drug as Ive tried everything else I always went into retention which would burn me up I love this
908,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42295,49,IC nearly drove me out of my mind I had it for yearseven underwent an experimental surgery to increase the bladder neck Worthless Considered DMSO infusion but did not want to put poison into my bladderFinally found a urologist who prescribed Elmiron At that time it supposedly only worked for about of patients Elmira totally totally worked for me Also never drink cranberry juice and stay away from all acidic foods One of the worst for me is watermelon No alcohol citrus fruits or tomatoes Its so worth it
909,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42276,65,Diagnosed with IC March by ER Physician I went to a UroGyno and was given Elmiron pill x per day and Hydroxyzine mg pill x per day Works for me I drinkeat what ever I want including drinking coffee and eating chocolate I have great insurance so cost is not a problem I have not experienced nausea vomiting or hair loss Please try it it might be the answer youre looking for
910,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42145,49,I thought I was having frequent UTIs the majority of my life I did everything I could think of to prevent and treat them The summer of and multiple negative UTI tests I was tested for IC and a test to see the size of my bladder Turns out my bladder was VERY large for my size I not only began taking Elmiron two pills twice a day but also had to retrain by bladder by quotgoingquot every two hours After about two months I started to finally feel relief that I had been searching for for over years I have been on Elmiron for almost two years I have dropped from pills a day down to and now down a day I stay away from lemon and very citrusacidic foods My goal is to be off Elmiron by the time I want kids No side effects
913,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42106,13,Its awesome
914,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,9,42082,38,I went to my gynecologist for what I thought were vaginal infections It felt like my vagina was on fire all of the time She sent me to a great Urologist because she suspected IC Sure enough I had a raging case of it He put me on Elmiron It took to months to begin working My pain went away almost totally I have experienced hair loss that isnt that noticeable I tried going off of it Big Mistake Ill be on it the rest of my life When I sometimes eat one of the foods not on the IC diet and experience pain I take a UribelAnother great medication Elmiron is a miracle worker for me
915,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,42067,45,I have been taking Elmiron mg since August after being diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis If I quotcheatquot on the IC diet I still have mild to moderate flareups but I am now painfree most of the time and able to have a fairly normal sex life I have not lost any hair and have found that the digestive sideeffects are mild
916,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,9,42062,21,I suffered from tremendous pain beinning at the age of and did not find out that I had IC until age At that time I was told that IC was untreatable and began using catheters However that lasted for maybe a few weeks A couple years later I learned of a urologist in the area who performed the hydroextension of my bladder which worked for a few months She shortly after prescribed Elmiron for me I currently take and have been taking for the past years mg twice a day mg total The pain has subsided greatly but I still experience some amounts of pain nothing close to before though I have not experienced any hair loss but want to try something different before such occurs
917,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,3,41986,29,I couldnt tolerate the tremendous amount of hair loss on Elmiron so now I take Vitanica Bladder Ease and Marshmallow Root for IC I prefer CystoProtek but its too expensive
918,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Bladder Infection,6,41971,15,I was on this medication months ago The first three months were okay no obvious side effects After a problem at the pharmacy I didnt have access for weeks and then continued on it for another months and I am having the bad abdominal pain and sweeping yet again This time it feels like a radiating infection type of pain Sharp pains in te front where I suspect my bladder is I am now having this bloody mucus instead of bowel movements I have also been experiencing hair loss in great amounts during showers This medication seems to work at first and then begins to wreck havoc in other areas after extended use I am on a strict IC diet so I know that that is not the contributing factor
919,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,41965,27,Not only do I have Interstitial Cystitis but I also have an extremely small bladder After the nd surgery to stretch it it still only has a capacity of mL My doctor just started me on Elmiron for the pain and will do a Botox treatment for the bladder spasms in a couple weeks Since I started taking the Elmiron I have noticed blurred vision I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or if it is unrelated and the onset of symptoms is just a coincidence
920,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41925,66,I have unexplained pelvic inflammationinterstitial cystitis In fact all the women in my immediate family do We are convinced its due to undiagnosed auto immune disease Taking the Elmiron was a somewhat challenging couple of months dizzy loss of appetite but after months it was all worth it Seriously changed my life urgency burning constant cramps amp pains muscle spasms gone
922,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41905,26,CAPSULES AT NIGHT worked for me after monthsBut the cost is outrageous
926,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41798,2,I live in India years of age I was suffering from urgency nocturia bladder burning sensation I showed to a urologist he did many tests including cystoscopy and doubtfully labelled me as Interstitial Cystitis but was not sure of his diagnosis so showed to more urologists over the span of next years who were very casually saying it to be chronic urinary tract infection urethral stricture as if they didnt even believe in ICs existencebut I believed I had IC then finally I visited an IC expert in Ahmedabad who confirmed IC gave me PPS mg per day amitriptyline mg per day amp hydroxyzine mg per day Im relieved within months now taking only PPS only bananas aggravate my situation Not doing any restriction on coffee and other items
927,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41744,64,After having what I thought was a bladder infection for about months taking ever antibiotic there was I finally found a Urologist that was willing to work with me He did the scope and indeed confirmed I had interstitial cystitis He put me on Elmiron I still have flare ups but nothing with a lot of water and pain meds I get back to a normal life I have been on the Elmiron for years About months I decided to take myself off and see if I could get by without taking the meds VERY wrong decision I went back on Elmiron and thank GOD I am better now I have come to the conclusion I will always be on Elmiron However if this is what it takes to have a normal life then so be it

930,Metoprolol Tartrate,High Blood Pressure,8,42904,17,Had first bypass op in second a triple in I have been taking mg tablet per day for years now age I take half the tablet in morning and half at night my own method have found this best for me Have a little Fibrillation from time to time in the form of hard heavy beat lasting about half hour My blood pressure is good tending a little to the low side pulse normally around Have not had side affects that I am aware of

933,Metoprolol Tartrate,High Blood Pressure,10,42463,17,In summertime I have quotRepair of Ascending Aortic Aneurysmquot operation The mg Metoprolol is one of the main medication that help me in heart rate and hypertension The Norvasc and Hydrochorlthadize are other medication that cannot without it But the Diovan makes my heart uncomfortable It took me a year to figured out
934,Metoprolol Tartrate,High Blood Pressure,8,42018,111,This medication does keep my hypertension under control and also seems to effect my heart rate by lowering it by an average of bpm I take other medications that tend to raise my heart rate so this medication is useful for me in that regard I have found that this medication is very sensitive to dosing propery I have found that if I miss only a couple of doses my blood pressure and heart rate start to increase
936,Metoprolol Tartrate,Heart Attack,8,41848,104,Im a YO male in fairly good shape I started taking Metoprolol mg twice a day after suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this year in April It has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure and keeping my heart rate low The side effects are becoming unbearable now though Im tired and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning and have now developed a rash under my arms I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today and hes cutting my dose in half Im hoping some of these side effects will diminish when I cut down to mg twice a day

939,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42932,1,I have been on so many different drugs for my RA this one has been the best one yet I do have insurance but the cost with insurance is still very high a month My doctors office helped me to help from Xeljanz to pick up the difference
940,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42864,2,Xeljanz XR is the first medication to truly give me relief I has allowed me to live somewhat of a normal life None of the biologics worked and methotrexate was a bust with lots of side effects Ive been on it for months and an very happy
941,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42916,31,After failing all other RA treatments I was highdose steroid dependent and running out of options Ill admit the PML risk had scared me off from trying Rituxan sooner however the increasing and very real risk of becoming nonfunctional scared me more I began infusions about years ago While most patients receive concomitant methotrexate therapy I do not due to liver damage from previous methotrexate use Rituxan has improved my quality of life physically mentally emotionally My advanced RA will never allow me to live quotnormallyquot but I am the best me I can be with this treatment Side effects are minimal for me nausea for a few days after each infusion Thats my story
942,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,42841,22,I had first infusion with no problems during administration but weeks after I had to go to the ER with a heart arrhythmia and had to have my heart shocked back into normal rhythm Two days later had second infusion with no problems during administration weeks later same thingback to the ERheart shocked back into rhythm Heart rate was stuck at bpm Had to be put in hospital for days to be given an anti arrhythmic drug that can also cause a fatal arrhythmia So I would be cautious if you have any type of heart problem prior to taking Rituxan I will not ever take it again

946,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42274,72,Rituxan has completely changed my life for the better I was in a clinical trial and tried several other medications with some success but my symptoms eventually returned After four sessions of Rituxan over a two year period I stopped seeing my RA doctor because I had no symptoms I am now going into my th year without pain I am playing softball tennis and golf without any pain I highly recommend this drug to anyone dealing with RA
947,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,41805,83,Entering the th hour of the process during my st infusion I experienced annoying itching deep within my ears back of throat head and face Shortly after the quotpushquot increasing the drip I broke out into hives on my face head and neck with red welts ironically appearing in the areas where I had historically given myself the Enbrel injectionsfront of both thighs and stomach Enbrel had stopped its effectiveness after almost yrs and it had been almost month from my last injection prior to the infusion My Dr made the decision to discontinue the infusion fearing that my allergic reaction may cause anaphylaxis
948,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,41713,70,I had two infusions Both lasted hours I couldnt tolerate the infusion faster than mlhr I would get chest pain and muscle rigors MD refused to continue after that
949,Rituxan,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,10,41457,72,I was diagnosed with CLL I began Rituxan once the lymph nodes began to enlarge and my counts were doubling Initially I was infused once per week for a month I have continued with this infusion but moved to a monthly visit It is now July and my numbers have dropped significantly and my doctor has moved to a maintenance programinfusion every other month I have never had any side effects from the infusions and doctor is pleased that Ive not required chemotherapy medicines added to get same results Prior to each infusion I take two mg Benadryl and a Tylenol Perhaps these medicines beforehand have aided me I have no complaints
952,Rituxan,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,8,41307,38,I have gone through three rounds of Rituxan for AutoImmune Hemolytic Anemia triggered by early stage Chronic Lymphocytic LeukemiaEach time I have had initial reactions with the first dose My throat and ears get itchy and my throat starts to swell They give me IV Benadryl and have administered Decadron slowed down the infusion and I have done okayIt is very gradual improvement in my hemoglobin So slow that Im not sure it is working but my doctors believe it is The only alternative is prednisone which makes me completely hyper and unable to sleep Rituxan is the better alternative Unfortunately it is not stopping my AIHA just keeping my hemoglobin up It is extremely expensive though

969,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42891,17,Elmiron has changed my life I knew immediately that it was helping with my symptoms of urgency and bladder pain It is a little pricey but I dont even care Living with IC can be miserable and elmiron makes it possible to feel good again
972,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42755,35,This medicine has changed my life I suffered with IC for almost two years before taking it It worked a little after weeks of taking it but it started working incredibly well at three months I now only go to the bathroom times a day I was going up to at least times a day before that I can now drink soda and tea without a problem I still stay away from citrus and spicy foods as I am too scared to try those I have had zero side effects I take this pill on an empty stomach and then wait an hour later to eat I am a military veteran and am able to get this medicine from the VA for an copay

983,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42556,0,It took years to be diagnosed with IC I had urge to urinate My urologist did a cystoscopy and found Hunners Ulcers and immediately gave me a script for Elmiron Elmiron worked really fast for me and I no longer had the constant urge to urinate after about weeks However it does cause diarrhea and I have suffered this side effect every day for the last years The benefits of Elmiron far outweigh the side effects

990,Torsemide,Edema,10,42457,14,I find that torsemide works very well for me I dont take it every day more like every third or fourth day The only down side is that if I take it every day I get very painful cramps in my thighs Now I take CalciumMagnesium and that seems to reduce the incidense of cramping If one does happen I also take a tablespoon of mustard recommended by Dr Oz on tv which has turmeric in it and that helps very much alsoTorsemide helps greatly with reducing any edema that I have in my ankles feet and legs Other than the occasional cramping I experience no other side effects and I will continue taking this drug
991,Torsemide,Edema,10,41890,37,Torsemide has really been effective in reducing the edema that I suffer from Pulmonary Hypertension IT really gets out the extra fluid without any harsh side effects I used to take LAsix furosemide and I had to be taken off it after I suffered painful red nodules all up and down my legs Furosemide was far more harsh than the Demadex and Im glad my doctor switched me to it

1019,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42984,0,I wasted pound on this garbage Would strongly suggest antibiotics instead of wasting both time and money
1020,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42980,0,st day fine nd day it made me SO sick Severe stomach cramps and I mean severe Nausea dizziness headache racing heart backache weakness and fatigue I havent used it for days and most symptoms have cleared but the stomach cramps and fatigue are still very painful MD said to go to emergency for stomach pain but its an hour drive so I opted to try to sleep it off Since its still ongoing Ill be seeing my MD tomorrow I will never take this again
1021,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42923,5,Earlier this year my skin looked downright awful with tons of redness with small papules all over my forehead I started using this once per day with Avene Skin Recovery Cream and my skin is clear less red Love
1022,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42918,10,When I first looked at the reviews for Rozex I was terrified because so many of them said it made their condition worse until someone reminded me that happy people dont usually write reviews So I wanted to write a good one I have acne rosacea so about minutes after I would take a sip of red wine I would break out in huge bumps that last for weeks Im a yr old in Ireland so obviously the idea of never drinking again was troubling but so was the thought of having horrible acne after so many years of nice skin I started rozex a few months ago and the effects came in semislowly maybe a month or two but now it works amazingly I dont even worry about it anymore I can go on a huge night out and wake up with great skin
1025,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,42883,16,Im and have had rosacea untreated for about yearswith pustules mostly the last yearsone doctor telling me it was adult acne Anyway it got really bad after changing my diet to keto and I knew it should have cleared my skin up but the pustules got so bad My Dr prescribed the generic gel and within two weeks the pustules were completely goneband another two weeks and skin texture is wonderful but the redness remains on my cheeks so only Im going to ask my Dr about something else when I go back for the redness Id like to know why I waited so long to treat it This worked great and my skin hasnt been this clear ever in my life No side effects that I can tell
1026,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,2,42878,2,I was diagnosed with BV and was prescribed Metronidazole Vaginal Gel After my treatment I saw little to no improvement in my symptoms I have had BV once before however this was my first time using this specific gel It also caused an unpleasant discharge sort of like white thick wet toilet paper I was prescribed Clindamycin vaginal cream before this case of BV This cream was more effective It relieved and got rid of my BV completely I went to the gyno again yesterday and she prescribed me Clindamycin Most of my symptoms have gone away I dont recommend Metronidazole gel Im not sure why it didnt work for me It was definitely a waste of money Clindamycin vaginal gel is better
1027,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42873,2,Ive had BV a few times usually after I sleep with a new partner Every time I have been on this medication it works like a charm I am on day and I noticed yesterday all symptoms are completely gone Ive had the cream in the past and would say I prefer the pills Just less messy Also no bad side effects for me Ive been taking them with food and probiotics and have felt fine Ive refrained from alcohol as recommended Very happy with this treatment
1028,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,42871,2,I was prescribed this to treat BV I would take the first pill around after a meal and the next around dinner time I had no bad side effects I was taking it while on my period on day I came off of my period so far no signs of BV But Im looking forward to seeing if my BV is really gone being that I was on my period while taking this If this has cured my BV I will rate it
1029,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42867,15,I had mild to moderate Rosacea and started using the Metro cream two weeks ago I saw improvement within the first week Ive been using it twice a day after washing my face with Garnier Sulfate Free Gentle Cleanser I have dry skin so I then use CeraVe lotion with SPF in the am and CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream in the pm These combinations have really worked for me I think I am ready to cut back to once a day in the pm Ive been rather impressed with CeraVe moisturizers and the Garnier cleanser Im years old and was very frustrated by how my skin was changing having had pretty good skin throughout my life My skin is now clearer and brighter with no eruptions
1030,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42856,2,I havent taken any antibiotics for years days with metronidazole I felt it right away that it was working so well The fact that I dont take any medication made it super helpful Also eating the right food and taking probiotic prebiotics daily I know it probably doesnt make sense taking probiotics while on antibiotics I did some research its okay if you take the probiotics hour or more after you take the antibiotic They gave me metronidazole for x a day in days So what i did is I take it morning and night time and in between I take probiotics and enzymes I Also eat lots of fermented food like kimchi lots of veggies drinking bone broth and green juice Green tea is also good while on antibiotics
1032,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42821,10,I had mild rosacea when I started using metrocream It made me break out extremely badly all over my cheeks and nose I think it clogged my pores making the redness and Rosacea much worse Very disappointed in the setback it gave me
1034,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,42805,5,Very good for folliculitis Tried everything else Gave me relief after first application
1036,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,42753,21,I think this stuff is great I have rosacea that seems to run in the family worsened by the dryness of winter Ive been using this for a week and it works pretty well Apply it once before bed and another time during the day and my skin had significantly improved in redness The scaliness of rosacea is also gone Would recommend
1039,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42734,20,Garbage It takes it away for a little while and right back again it comes I been going through this for years now As far as Im concerned this medicine causes it to reoccur which I feel like the government and pharmaceuticals purposely did to make MONEY
1041,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,5,42383,3,I was diagnosed with BV by my obgyn and she prescribed me with Metronidazole mg twice a day for days I took the pill and noticed that my discharge lessened but My odor was still traveling around but it wasnt as strong Then as the days went on Day I felt dizzy and as like the room was spinning minor cramps headacheDay nausea cramps dizziness headache constipation dry mouth loss of appetiteDay I was vomiting all night and I decided to stop taking the pills and called my doctor in the morning because the side effects werent getting any better and my BV didnt seem to be clearing up as much as I wanted it to She prescribed me metronidazole vaginal gel for days And havent taken yet but will be reviewing
1042,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42326,8,Had BV for the first time didnt know what to expect but this medicine made me confident again and stop suffering from embarrassing odors
1043,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42316,13,Its great doesnt help the infrequent redness but keeps the skin clear for me just when I notice the flare up until it subsides The cost is exorbitant a tube g
1048,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,6,42240,22,This gel is amazing and I have used it on amp off for years but now my body is paying the price I first noticed each time I used it my hands would go numb then my vision began deteriorating with a stigmatism Now its at the point my hands go numb quickly within a half hour of using this Just be aware and careful I used it about x a year for years Cannot use anymore
1049,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,42238,46,The first time I got BV the doc prescribed Clindamycin and a month later it came rite back then he prescribed me Flagyl and a month later it still came back as well I felt like less of a woman bc of this I thought that I would never have a sex life again and i was hysterical then he prescribed me the MetroGel and after the first use symptoms were gone I was like a kid in the candy store he prescribed me like refills for if it comes back I made sure that he gave me enough refills I love it so far and I have a prescription for past nights to make sure it doesnt come back this works I love it better than the pills
1052,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,42187,33,Having foolishly used a steroid lotion on my forehead rosacea I had a real flare up when after weeks I stopped using it Horrible lumps amp lots of whiteheaded pustules appeared as well as larger red spots making me very selfconscious It hardly helped that I was about to head off an a week business trip meeting lots of new people I tried Azelaic Acid which seemed to make matters more inflamed Then having overlooked it thinking it was pretty first base I tried metrogel clear gel After days I thought I could see an improvement Within days it was clearly working no new pustules were appearing and the old ones were being shrunk down Within a week my forehead looked pretty clear days later it was fine Recommended
1053,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42177,54,Have been diagnosed with Rosacea that I have had apparently for years was not willing to seek medical advice and treatment due to money concerns Two and years since my last consulting with Dr And all I can say is I am amazed at the results topically applied Metronidazole gel has given me I am grateful for being able to shave my face without feeling like it was a blood sacrifice Only one regret why didnt I do it sooner happier now
1055,Metronidazole,Rosacea,6,42166,12,When I used the lotion I found that it did get rid of a few pimples It definitely does not get rid of any redness whatsoever Even though its the same thing I find the lotion to be more effective than the cream
1056,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42154,43,This has been a wonderful medication for me I was having BV monthly and it was impacted my sex life My doctor recommended that I use it after Intercourse and I havent had any problems since then Highly recommended
1057,Metronidazole,Rosacea,5,42148,10,It really hasnt seem to change anything for me other than it lightened a tiny bit of the redness Im hoping its just because Ive only been using for weeks Hopeful but skeptical been down this road many times nothing seems to work entirely for me
1058,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,42134,8,Okay i have tried the gel the only side effect is loss of appetite and a bad yeast infection Looks like i growing biscuits but the diflucan took it all away It work
1059,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42126,72,Ive always had a problem with odor and tried douching etc but nothing ever helped FINALLY I spoke with a PA who told me I probably have an over abundance of quotgoodquot bacteria which produces this odor She prescribed Metrodinazole and I used it as prescribed NO MORE EMBARRASSING ODOR I dont know how long this will last but I could cry from relief Unless you experience thus yourself you dont understand the thoughts always in the back of your mind So thankful for this medication
1060,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,42102,32,I suffered from rosacea for years but as I went through menopause it seemed to decrease in frequency However when it did pop up it was more intense so the last time I had an outbreak I finally broke down and asked my new doctor for something and he gave me MetroGel I was a bit dismayed to read the label that it could take weeks to be effective but like several others here I literally saw results after the first application I applied it at bedtime and was quite surprised the first night to find my face noticeably less inflamed the next morning and smoother I have used it several nights in a row now and my face seems to be healing from this latest outbreak much more quickly than I could ever have expected
1061,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42075,15,This really works this is my first bacterial vaginitis and was really freaked out but after talking to my doctor she said it was normal and prescribed this I am so happy and relieved
1062,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42050,62,I have found that Metrogel works wonders for me It made a difference the first time I applied it Applied at night woke up in the morning with noticeably clearer skinIt is recommended to use it twice a day but I just apply it once at night because it causes a filmy layer over the skin and I wouldnt want to go out in public like that and that seems to be enough for me
1063,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42031,68,Used gel for days The smell was gone the next morning Still continued to use it for the remaining days It made everything so much better Im glad they have this treatment
1064,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,41943,45,Day and night difference All the redness and the red veins are gone My skin looks fantastic
1065,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42729,24,I find Metrogel more effective than Finacea It minimizes redness and breakouts with no irritation
1066,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42721,12,My doctor took several vaginal samples and tested for yeast all stds and bacteria The ONLY thing that was positive was g Gardnerella which is bacteria She gave me flagyl MG daily x days and told me to use metrogel x a week for months Still not better and just finished weeks of the gel which is doses I have zero odor never had any but my discharge is like acid My skin around the vaginal opening is extremely red and it burns and sometimes I itch Im majorly frustrated I have used desitin and vaseline to try and keep the discharge from burning me so bad docs suggestion but those tend to make me worse Im truly so depressed I just dont feel like this is ever going to go away No sex for months now
1067,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,42708,0,Pap came back saying i had BV Ok was given this gel to use at night for days Ugh rd night stomach ache since day one will finish the last and hopefully i will feel better Today I though i was going to pass out Actually hope its the prescription and not something else It cost with my crap insurance Good thing for my health savings plan
1068,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42702,11,Day of rosacea flareup thought I was having an allergic reaction to seafood My face turned red and swollen my chest was covered in a rash I took Benadryl that did nothing other than make me sleepDay symptoms got worse with my skin hurting but realized it was Rosacea I had a tube of Metronidazole cream that I put on immediately relieving the pain Day skin looks much better today Started on Minocycline mg qid Couldnrsquot sleep because of itchingDay less redness and swelling No itchingDay and on cheeks still red but otherwise look normal Rash is gone After stopping the Metronidazole skin texture gradually returned to normal Irsquom still on the antibiotic
1069,Metronidazole,Rosacea,6,42697,8,I am amp noticed a change in my face after my second baby After breastfeeding I was finally excited to see a dermatologist Immediately was told Rosacea She prescribed doxycycline amp metro gel Within days I saw improvements but at my day appt I still looked red She told me to continue amp return in days I am nearing my appt with no acne but redness amp a slight scarring complexion My cheeks nose amp chin get really red from heat or spicy foods Ive noticed I dont really feel like the metro gel is helping much cause I always wear a little redness nowadays
1071,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,2,42649,17,Ive had bv off and on for years tried the day course multiple times Always came back in a couple days Was told to do metro gel twice a week for months This has kept it at bay but never got rid of it I was tested positive for group strep b was told I may have had this overgrowth infection since I gave birth to my second son years ago and that it could be the cause of the bv or the symptoms of bv After the penicillin treatment Ive noticed a slight difference but still having to use the metro gel to keep it at bay I take a raw probiotic twice a day as well I wish this medicine worked like it has on everyone Ive known to it This bv stuff is so crippling
1072,Metronidazole,Rosacea,5,42647,10,Initially had good response to gel but days after starting it I looked like I had a mild sunburn I then started getting multiple finger joint swelling with swelling redness and pain and then gastric problems Obviously having side effects Back to neomycin creme
1073,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42633,28,I used metrogel for nights It worked great The itching and burning were relieved the very first night I took it I did have to do a sixth dose two nights after the fifth night because the symptoms came back slightly but since then I have been fine That was a week ago and since then no problems at all The only home remedies I had tried were the probiotics folic acid vitamin D and vitamin C I also ate a lot of plain yogurt I think the vitamins and yogurt worked to give temporary relief but ultimately it was the Metrogel that did the trick Crossing my fingers I dont have a relapse I decided to use the gel and not the pills so the drugs dont have to go through your whole body The gel just attacks the problem at the source
1075,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42611,12,Started the gel or so weeks ago for my rosacea and its just gotten a million times worse My cheeks are angrier than ever and Im even getting spots on areas that are normally clear like my forehead nose and chin
1076,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,42609,2,I did experience some side effects the feeling of menstrual cramping but not because I had a hysterectomy years ago diarrhea some vaginally discharge Nothing severe or unbearable
1079,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,7,42561,7,Ive been on the gel for days First diagnosed with a UTI with no growth Finished Cipro and still had symptoms Second round pelvic exam amp swab Still had bacteria amp yeast so was prescribed metro gel No side effects but hasnt helped my issue Waiting for nd culture to come back to see if still UTI and wasnt sensitive to the Cipro and need something new Pains from hell
1081,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,3,42559,5,I tried the Metro gel for the first time for Bacterial Vaginosis I have always used antibiotic pills before Using yogurt and probiotics I have never had a yeast infection after antibioticsuntil using the Metro gel I have never had a yeast infection so bad that yeast clumps were falling outuntil using the Metro gel The yeast infection began before I was even done with the Metro gel There was NO yeast present before the Metro gel A culture was run at the lab before starting any treatment and that is how the BV was diagnosed YI did not show at all on the lab result I will NEVER us the Metro gel again unless I am given Diflucan spelling pills to take through the gel treatment to prevent the yeast infection
1082,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42549,12,Used it twice a day for several months and it did nothing to help reduce the redness or bumps It cost as well and that was with percent covered
1083,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,4,42546,9,Tried this gel for night thinking it would have less side effects than in pill formBut I had a very bad experience Within half an hour of using my legs felt as if they were on fire mainly from my knees to feetGot worse with achingshooting pains up and down my legsMy head felt funny but no headacheAll night I barely slept cos of the severity of the painThe hotness did lessenstill had painful legs until mid morningbut it had spread to rest of body a dull ache as if I had fluHad slight blocked nose til morning as wellFelt slightly nauseousWas itchy too all overFelt spaced outSuffered memory loss in day before all went awayWill not take again as am allergic to antibiotics so is probably just meBV did feel bit better though
1084,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42542,40,I am and never had a skin condition Ever Heat stress lack of sleep all contributed to a redness to my face Now it cracks and peels and swells I started metronidazoleb and it clears up in two days Put non oily lotion over the top and I can put makeup on Yeah
1085,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,42539,9,At the age of my nose stayed to break out at the Time I thought it was acne but after seeing A dermatologist I was told It was rosacea with looks like acne with red spot and white heads I used the metro percent gel for one week and felt like it made it worse so I stopped After weeks my rosacea was at the worse it had been I tryed the gel again weeks on the gel and I have not got any white heads or and new spots I do have redness Only side affect is it seems as I am growing hair on my nose not sure
1086,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42487,11,This medication did nothing for me
1087,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42463,28,After nine years of no flare ups I suddenly found myself with the red cheeks and pustules I decided to consult a dermatologist who prescribed me sulfa cleanse and a very low dose antibiotic Within several days my face was extremely red raw and full of large painful pustules Heartbroken I decided to see my regular doctor and he prescribed me metro gel and a stronger antibiotic I saw results instantly From one day to the next my redness and inflammation went down to the point that I noticed it Now only days later my face is back to normal I am amazed at how fast the metro gel combined with the right antibiotics cleared my face up I am forever grateful to my doctor and metro gel for helping me smile again
1088,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42454,17,Ive been getting bacteria infections on and off for about yrs have always taking the metrodonizole pills and they give me a bad taste in my mouth so this time I wanted to try the vaginal gel Did not work at all Plus gave me a yeast infection Now having to redue treatment with pills Fml
1089,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,2,42431,16,I was diagnosed with BV and took this medicine PERFECTLY for days After the first day I got severe crippling anxiety attacks which are very uncommon for me I also had an upset stomach cramps and diarrhea for a week The symptoms of BV never cleared up I started my period after day of medicine and after that I was back to square one It did not work at all for any of the symptoms except the smell of the discharge was less bad so thats why I gave it a two instead of a one Still trying to find a medicine that helps me This is so frustrating
1090,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,39814,66,I have found that MetroGel clears up the pustule like eruptions within hours
1091,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,39683,44,Worked great and very fast No side effects experienced
1092,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,41935,28,Ive been using it for about weeks After the first few days I noticed a considerable difference in the size of my pores I tend to have oily skin and as a bonus this medication seems to decrease oil production I will keep using it
1093,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,41871,53,I had flushing rosacea for years before it was diagnosed Then I spent years trying one medication after another to control it but due to side effects could not take them About years ago I was prescribed MetroGel It has changed my life The persistent flushing and burning are almost completely gone I still wear sunscreen and a hat when outside but now I can read at night and watch TV with the lights on
1095,Metronidazole,Rosacea,7,41790,46,Well there isnt a cure but this sure helps
1098,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,41428,42,I had bacterial vaginitis It was very unpleasant as one would expect My Dr prescribed Metrogel and Diflucan Did the gel for three nights About two weeks later itch occurred so I took the Diflucan Ive had bacterial vaginitis twice and subsequently a yeast infection Metrogel diflucan combo worked great for meGave an because I got a yeast infection after the bacterial vaginitis treatment but Diflucan cleared it up
1099,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,41346,49,Since MetroGel I no longer smell
1100,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,41201,74,I have found Metrocream to be very effective in combating symptoms of rosacea especially the pimple like lesions I get around my nose amp chin area I use only when needed and notice after just a couple of applications a dramatic improvement
1104,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,40816,61,Great working only if you use nonstopand start to work only after weeks therapy
1105,Metronidazole,Rosacea,2,40554,33,This medicine worked for about two weeks and then stopped
1107,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,40529,36,Have used this medication for months and found it to be ineffective in controlling the rosacea I continued to use it only at the urging of my physician applying it three times daily with NO symptomatic relief
1108,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,40484,59,When I use Metrogel I dont have to worry about bacterial vaginitis coming back easily It helps faster and its very effective When I take the oral medicines bacterial vaginitis recurs within weeks That can be a major pain The only bummer is the yeast infection that can sometimes occur
1109,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,40316,53,I love this medicine cor bacterial vaginitis It works well and I never have side effects However I almost always get a yeast infection afterwards so I have my doctor prescribe Diflucan as well
1110,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,40245,76,After weeks of using it my face is redder bumpier itchy and sore
1111,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,40205,49,This medication has been very effective in controlling my rosacea symptoms Since it has a cream base it helps with my dry skin as well
1113,Metronidazole,Perioral Dermatitis,8,40181,15,Works pretty well for my perioral dermatitis but I should have seen a doctor sooner Its been resistant to the medicine but is slowly healing Definitely have the metallic taste in my mouth from it and a bit of intestinal discomfort
1115,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,39966,81,Metrogel is a very good solution to curing a vaginal infection A common side effect not listed is heavy discharge I have also experienced pelvic cramping from day but about the same as menstrual cramps
1116,Metronidazole,Rosacea,6,39832,36,Useful for rosacea that is not extremely out of control If you have just a few pustules it can be helpful when used regularly
1118,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,43071,0,I tried it today cause Irsquove been getting really bad migraines and I tried it expecting it to work but instead I got bad side effects neck is tighten and I also have a severe migraine really disappointed and going to speak to my doctor about finding me something else never taking it again
1120,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,43042,0,This is the only Rx that will get rid of my migraines thus far but it has painful side effects I stumbled across the antioxidant drink called BAIacute Justin Timberlake and Christopher Walken do a commercial for it and it literally takes away the side effects so Im not in pain or knocked our for the hours it takes to get through my system You take the pill with the Baiacute and slowly sip on it As soon as you feel an ache take another drink I have no idea why it works but it does
1121,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,43035,0,This review is for the injectable form of Imitrex sumatriptan only For anyone that has tried the pill or nasal spray forms and found them ineffective please try the injections They work wonders and act fast Ive tried the other types and they actually seemed to make me more nauseous and especially the nasal spray I keep one in my purse at all times so that I can get relief anytime a migraine hits The pain is not bad as the needle is very small and thin You dont have to jab yourself just press against your skin and push a button The pain of migraine is much worse Ive found the most comfortable injection site to be the bit of fat at the top of my buttox I use the mg injections but Im pretty sure there is also a lower dose
1122,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,43025,2,Had a allergic reaction to this medication and it was one of the scariest moments of my life
1123,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42995,3,I was suffering bad migraines for days until I came across this medicine which works wonders
1124,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42994,4,I am perimenopausal age and for last several years suffered from debilitating migraines I days wasted because I was too sick from these headaches Forget Excedrin for migraines or any other OTC drugs no relief whatsoeverThis past weekend I had a migraine that pretty much knocked me out the pain was horrific nausea vomiting and cried like a babyFinally went to emergency room and they gave me Imitrex Within minutes headache was gone I was very sleepy but I dont know if thats a side effect or just from not sleeping the prior days
1125,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42985,7,Reading some of these reviews makes me wonder how much of a chance they gave the medication Ive had vascular migraines since I was Im today I take Excedrin migraine for my headaches I take Imitrex for my migraines Used to be hard to tell the difference I understand now the difference But before I found Imitrex I took all kinds of prevention meds Amitriptyline nortriptyline Zoloft more than I can remember Never prevented a darn thing Just ended up with side effects from those As a teen that meant acne and weight gain Aka hell Its been years now since Ive found Imitrex And like many I was worried about trying it But there came a day I couldnt NOT try it minutes later I kicked myself for waiting
1126,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42984,5,I have had migraines since my teenage years sumatriptan is the only medication that works every single time with no side effects besides being a little tiered thank goodness for this pill
1127,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42968,5,I am yrs old I started having migraines at age so yrs now About to a week These migraines changed my life completely for the worst Sometimes they were so bad I would have rather died All of a sudden I couldnt work I quit my job at age Spent yrs trying or different medicines and other remedies to get rid of or control my migraines and nothing worked for me until I tried mg sumatriptan To keep my point short mg sumatriptan has been a miracle drug for me I just have to make sure I take it immediately when I feel a migraine coming and take it with food timing is everything with this drug Take too early it wont work and too late then it will take longer to work
1128,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42954,1,Works of the time
1130,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42946,6,Iam years old and I have been suffering from chronic migraine since the age of no medication has worked like Imitrex or sumatropan I take the pill when I have migraine pain and literally it takes about to minutes and WALLA migraine GONE YES THANKS science
1133,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42923,6,I preferred Relpax but my insurance stopped covering it Imitrex works at least of the time but maybe of those times the headache recurs and I have to take another one which almost never happened with Relpax My side effects are weird but not debilitating sense of pressure in head neck chest shoulders arms tingling in face dry burning eyes skin sensitivity to hotcold taste sensitivity to spicysour lack of appetite sweat thirst diuretic A bit sluggish and sometimes drowsy but not truly fatigued Almost never nauseous never dizzy A couple of hours later I often feel mild muscle soreness The side effects are stronger if I take it on an empty stomach but it also works faster
1134,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42915,1,I was having my followup appointment with my neurologist and she gave me a sample of this because the oral tablets were not working and the nasal solution was taking a while to work for me This was my miracle drug for me one evening I felt my migraine coming on and I tried my sample pack I was very nervous about blowing something up my nostril but this wasnt bad at all and within minutes I could feel my headache start to calm down I did not have to go into my dark room I am really impressed and you dont taste the medication going down your throat as much as you do with the solution Thank you
1135,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42912,11,Ive been experiencing migraines for about years now The pain is always on one side of my head and is completely debilitating I used to have to take a bunch of Ibuprofen and sleep in a cool dark room until it went away which took forever Finally I was introduced to this medicine I took it a few hours into my migraine and the pain was gone within minutes The medicine made me feel a little weird like my senses were overly receptive and my skin was a bit tingly These temporary symptoms are NOTHING compared to the migraine Ive learned to like these odd side effects because thats how I know my migraine is leaving This is a miracle drug and over the past year Ive been taking it its never failed to relieve the pain
1136,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42910,3,After suffering with cluster headaches for two years I was prescribed sumatriptan mg tablets which were effective if taken on an empty stomach They got to work in about min which saved a good hour or so of debilitating pain so were great When the next bout hit I asked about the injections as the tablets didnt always workwork quick enough Doctor agreed and I got Imigran mg Wow Just wow Aborts the headache within a couple of minutes of injection which is simple and easy They are a lifesaver and I would recommend anybody who suffers cluster headaches to ask your doctor about it In the UK theyre available on NHS my doctor was hesitant at first as apparently they cost pound per injection pack But they are worth it
1137,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42899,4,Started having debilitating not able to take my head from under the pillow and nauseavomiting migraines after having my daughter I get about a month most of them are menstrual migraines but I was lucky to find imitrex soon after I started having migraines I used to take injectable or nasal spray but have been on mg tabs for a few years now Nothing else but Imetrex works and it works for me every time I am not a fan of the side effects at all which are muscle tension mostly in jaw and neck as well as feeling drained for several hours after I will take it over the horrible migraines any day though
1139,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42891,0,Fabulous medication after getting to the point I was taking mg ibuprofen way too many a day and at least paracetamol and not even getting relief this came as a god send Worked wonderfully
1140,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42880,0,This was hugely helpful for me when my doctor figured out that I was suffering from migraines Once in a while I get sick to my stomach before the medication takes effect especially if Ive delayed taking it for whatever reason but I cant describe how much better it is to have this than to suffer If I lose a dose to emesis Ill take another with a small amount of water and wait for everything to calm down Keeps me functional where before Id have been wiped out and wishing for death for a day or more Side effects for me have been very mild and occasional Slight tingly feelings or a little bit of mental quotdistancequot from my surroundings Words cant describe how much better this is than torture
1141,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42877,4,Lifesaver This med has helped give me my life back I occasionally had days of lights off ice pack cool amp quiet bedroom time for the pain often to the point of vomiting Ive been on it for years and take the injections with warm amp tingly side effects but completely worth it I crash for an hour with an ice pack amp when I get up I feel fantastic Love ❤
1142,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,42874,0,My experience with generic imitrex has been bad It sometimes works sort of but a day or so after I have debilitating muscle aches It took me a while to make the association but once I switched back to the real medication that problem went away
1144,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,42865,0,Just tried sumatriptan for the first time I got it over the counter in a UK chemist Im a yr old man who has suffered from debilitating migraines since a teenager They have become less frequent with age but when I get the early signs aurora it still sends me into panic of whats to come lying helplessly in Hell for hours so when I heard of a new effective drug I jumped at the chance and this was my experience you get two pills I took one with water and laid down in a dark room after about mins I could feel the drug starting to take effect it was if the migraine was still happening but it had been dulled down or masked by the drug you feel tired sick and a bit bit weird but its better than the migraine pain
1146,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42854,5,I only used this one time it did not work for me and made me feel worse I hate that I have unused ones that are going to go to waste
1147,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42850,8,I have been using Imitrex mg injections for several years as an emergency migraine abortive While it did instantly relieve the head pain and nausea I had to then wait out minutes of side effects Those side effects were upper jaw pain and overall body aches like when you have the flu such as super sensitive skin even my hair hurt But for a long time this was the only option available to me through insurance and the side effects were more bearable than the migraine But recently the injection stopped working and I ended up having to go to the ER Now I have been given Zomig nasal spray I have not had a reason to try it yet but am worried about side effects
1149,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,42837,9,I avoid taking Imitrex if I can because I experience so many side effects from it I get jaw and shoulder painstiffness pain in the back of my neck and scalp headaches drowsiness and I just generally feel weird and awful after taking it After hours or so my migraine goes away and the awfulness of the Imitrex lessens so that is why I do take it occasionally Every time I take it Im reminded of how badly I need to find something else
1150,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,42836,2,Im and my doctor prescribed me this because I suffer from constant headachesmigraines This has the worst side effects which made my body ache it hurt when I yawned and I felt so much pressure on my chest My head was still pounding hours after taking it I wont be taking these again
1152,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,42815,3,Just took it for the first time today use to use Maxalt This drug completely knocked me out so sleepy and tired not to mention feeling very weird Its been hours and I feel not great Headache gone but left with fatigue and dizziness Back to maxalt
1153,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42811,0,The medication was amazing I loved how quickly it worked for my migraines I get too many a month to use Zecuity exclusively so I saved it for the bad nausea ones Unfortunately the second time I used it the patch burned a hole in my leg When I called to report it the company insisted it was just an allergic reaction I literally had a chunk of skin missing and I still have a scar several months later The medication is great but whatever they use to push it through the skin is not good Obviously since it has since been recalled Disposal of all of the materials is ridiculous I would have driven an hour or two to the nearest speciality pharmacy to not have to deal with the delivery and packaging of the medication
1154,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42810,2,Finally something nonaddictive that actually treats my migrainesI take this with an aleve and I usually get relief within an hour and the relief lasts a few hours about Only downside is that it makes you really drowsy and it makes you feel like quotblahquot for a few days after you take it but its totally worth it in my opinionAlso I feel safe taking it since its the only option my doctor had that doesnt have any warning about possible addiction
1156,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42804,4,Ive been getting migraines for years and every doctor kind of wrote it off as hormones or stress and just told me to relax and take advil They would last a couple days I couldnt get out of bed the whole time Just constant pounding in my neck eye teeth and forehead Last month I finally talked an neurologist into seeing me without a referral and he couldnt believe my other doctors and let it go on so long and not sent me to him He gave me the generic imitrex and said to take it with the antinausea med promethazineI had to use it for the first time yesterday It was amazing In mins I could tell it was going away I felt a little foggy for an hour or so and my reaction time was decreased for a few hours but Ill take it
1157,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42785,11,Works great the only one for me no side effects yrs old started getting these headaches last yr Excedrin Aspirin Fiercet and Advil didnt work takes about an hour to kick in but since nothing else works I can wait it out
1158,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42775,14,I have suffered migraines and headaches since I was little Iam years old and in physical healthy shape I as many I have been a prisoner in my own body Iam totally debilitated for what use to be hours at a time has grown to sometimes days I have suffered hearing loss ringing in my ears with the fullness and so many other symptoms from sinus pressure to neck pain etc I have at different times had epidural shots in my neck for migraines and tried all kinds of pain killers and daily meds to lower the severity and frequency they occur Last month alone I had headaches which were migraines UGH The Dr put me on Imitrex to try I was nervous but it is a miracle drug for me
1159,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,8,42775,5,Ive had cluster headaches for about years now and havent found any helpful meds until now Sumatriptan has been extremely helpful for me this cluster period I use the tablets so it takes about minutes to feel the effects I take it as soon as I start to feel tension in the head and neck with the slight onset of a headache By the time it starts to work the attack is almost in full force but once it kicks in the pain immediately subsides and begins to quickly go away It saves me at least a good hour of the intense tortuous pain which also saves me a lot of the side effects of the attacks such as nausea and fatigue Ive found little to no side effects along with the drug so Im almost immediately able to function afterwards
1160,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42763,4,Went to see my neurologist for usual migraine check up med refills treatment While there he suggested Botox another story DO NOT DO IT I am in horrible non stop pain since I was in the middle of an episode I got a Toradol injection and this NEW Onzetra Nasal Not a fan of anything going up my nose should have went with my gut instinct You put one opening in a nostril the other in your mouth and blow Like blowing up balloon blowing powder through out your nose soft palette and throat It felt like sucking salt water up your nose the pain was immediate eye watering dizzying nose pinching nauseous pain I coughed gagged cried wanted to scream days later am worse than ever pain shaking incapacitated Not worth it
1161,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42759,7,I have migraines that are usually triggered by hormonal changes around my menstrual cycle I have been taking this medication for roughly years now My migraines become so bad I shake vomit and otherwise feel like I am dying Sumatriptan has been a godsend for me I take the pill form and mg is all I usually need It takes around minutes to an hour to kick in were I feel I can function again and I feel completely normal by hours I request Dr Ready brand I have had some brands not work as well Hence the rating of for me due to inconsistent effectiveness with generic brands It does make me a little lightheaded and whole body fatigued for the first hour but that is nothing compared to suffering through a migraine
1162,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,1,42745,2,Ive been having chronic headaches for the past month to the point where they get severe not a migraine so I asked my dr for Sumatripan and she gave me it little did I know it doesnt get rid of the headache nor relieve it Im on day of it and all its done is make me dizzy my chest feel heavy and horrible that I cant breathe and need to cough hard my shoulders feel heavy and achein my neck and its made my headache feel like a full blown migraine which I havent felt for years never having it again I dont recommend this medication its made me feel really horrible
1164,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42739,3,I have read many of the other reviews of Sumavel DosePro and agree that I have had some not fire when I go to inject myself I have learned to be patient and continue to hold the applicator in place and continually push it into my skin until the injector fires It sometimes takes a while but it does eventually goes off You just need to be patient Yes its frustrating but when you have a migraine its worth the wait This has been a miracle drug for me and I will continue to use it as long as it is available to me
1165,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42739,4,I been suffering with Cluster Headaches for over years I just used the injected form of Sumatripan The pain was completely gone in mins Amazing
1166,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42738,4,I have suffered from chronic migraine headaches since I was I have at least a month Ive tried everything had MRIs done gone to several specialist and none could help me Eventually I was put on Sumatriptain which is used to stop the migraine in its track I am prescribed a month and almost always I use all This medicine has saved my life because after minutes my migraine is completely gone
1167,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,42601,5,Very bad experiencereaction with only half a dose Did not take away headache Increase in pain heavy weight feeling on my chest shortness of breath cold sweats This med was a nightmare for me I felt immediate pain and pressure in head neck and shoulders The worst however was feeling like a one hundred pound weight on my chest Additionally nausea and cold sweats and feeling like I was in big trouble practically and ER trip Beware of this med it may not be for everyone Will go back to advil and a coke or my fiorocet Cure is worse than the disease in this case for me
1168,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42595,7,I have had migraines for as long as I could remember especially when its bright loud noises or when Im on my phone I had a really bad migraine and I took a tablet as directed and I felt horrible after So bad it brought me to tears The migraine worsened and I felt nauseous and sick Never will take again
1170,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42593,5,I have a serious issue with Migraines Almost a week When the device was first prescribed back in I did not have a problem since they were coming from San Diego from Telegenics Once ENDO started producing the product all I have are failures I have had as many as of in a box fail to work I have had several that after I tried to use them they spontaneously quotwent offquot on the bathroom counter Luckily not in my face I have contacted ENDO at this point now early August I have not received even replacement for the that failed You know the cost My insurance will stop paying for them in a couple of monthsI reported every one to Endo But the issue is getting worse I have reported this chronic issue to the FDA
1171,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42591,1,Absolutely amazing Never found anything that could take away a migraine until my doctor prescribed this My migraines are gone within minutes of the shot Ive suffered with them since a child and now at I found something that really works This medication is a blessing to me
1173,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42580,4,severe migraines for years took Imitrex shots Immediate and I mean immediate relief Needle is very tiny and you put it up to the side of your thigh Highly recommend
1174,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42565,0,Id taken Excedrin for years wsome effectiveness amp then had a streak where headaches would return within a day and sought medical attention An urgent care doctor prescribed BubalbitalAPAPCaffeine and I used it as needed for about a year and was happy with the results but the prescription was running out Because the medication was prescribed by an urgent care doctor the prescription couldnt be refilled so I had to see an internal medicine doctor and he prescribed Sumatriptan After taking the medicine today it did eventually take away my visual auras and it seems to block the full on migraine but I feel kind of crummy with sinus drainage and pressure grogginess and slight nausea Going to try wpain reliever Naproxen
1175,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42562,8,It works well when you can get to inject This prescription with out insurance is over I have had numerous instances where it did not inject I have out of in my last prescription that failed I just got satisfaction on a failed injector from January I now take the same prescription and it only is a co pay where Suma Vel is amp co pay Robbery and the Endo pharmasuticals shood be ashamed
1176,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,42551,14,Words cannot express how grateful I am for this medicine I have dealt with these crippling headaches since my mid s Now in my mids I finally happened upon a physician at a CareNow of all places who actually listened to me as I told him of the nightmare I face at least three times a day every day for months on end and prescribed Imitrex for me If taken at the very first sign of an attack these little beauties I take the oral can save you minutes to several hours of unimaginable pain I cannot recommend enough that my fellow cluster headache sufferers ask their doctor about considering Imitrex While theres no cure this is the closest thing Ive found so far that at least makes living with these headaches bearable
1178,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42543,6,I am and had been having migraines severe enough to cause vomiting for about years without knowing what they were Was diagnosed a few months ago and given Sumatriptan It has changed my life No side effects at all I take to pill when early signs appear and some naproxen Within hour or so I am fine and life goes on
1179,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42543,5,I am For about years I have had occasional episodes of acute headaches to the point of vomiting Finally got diagnosed with migraine about months ago for some reason it never crossed my mind despite a family history of it Was prescribed sumatriptan Now when I feel a migraine coming on I take or pill along with naproxen Headache is gone within hour My life has greatly improved No side effects at all
1182,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42531,2,The medication itself works which is the only positive thing I can say This quotneedlelessquot injection is so much more painful than any needle Ive ever experienced Ill be going back to real injections My leg is still throbbing in pain minutes later and it took over minutes to stop the bleeding Ive never had pain or bleeding with an Imitrex shot through a hypodermic needle Who would choose this
1183,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42525,3,Imitrex has been a life saver for me As soon as I feel the headache coming I can take half of a mg imitrex and in min the headache subsides I have absolutely no side effects from this medication
1184,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42522,8,My Migraine headache started when I was or years old Now I am years old I have migraine headache about once a week unless when I am on vacation Usually I have them on Monday afternoons because its the first day of the work and I think my eyes get tired or maybe I have more stress But I can get Migraine for the number of reasons Last night for first time I used Imitrex I had awful feelings I cannot describe them but after couple hours my migraine was gone I got very sleepy but it felt very good The best part is that the next day I had no headache either Because my headaches usually takes days to go away I hope that it works next week as well
1186,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42489,9,I was diagnosed with severe painful and silent migraines a few months ago but the neurologist said Ive most likely suffered from silent migraines my entire life Im by the way but recently they have started getting painful Imitrex was the first medication I was put on I was excited to start feeling better but imitrex made me feel awful I suffer from extreme nausea before during and after a migraine and its completely life ruining Ive tried imitrex many times in hopes of it finally working Every time Id take it Id get a horrible burning in my throat and my migraine would worsen It didnt help nausea aura pain or any other migraine symptoms I suffer from Ive recently been put on another medication thatll hopefully work
1187,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42488,7,I have had migraine for years and been on every migraine medicine I am diagnosed as chronic with or more migraine days a month My doctor is very progressive with new treatments and offered zecuity because it is considered to be very clean as far as triptan side effects and no hangover or fog I was properly trained on how to use the medicine with insuring a good seal since it is a patch and forewarned that it can be uncomfortable the first or minutes I put it on ensuring a good seal Activated the red LED button It was prickly for about minutes Annoying but not painful My migraine was completely gone in minutes I had redness at the active site of delivery but it went away in a few days No other side effects
1189,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,42469,1,I first experienced cluster headaches at age in the spring several times a day for about a month just suffered through with OTC pain meds which did nothing Finally got to see a neurologist in my s who was awesome diagnosed as classic cluster headache got on verapamil prophilaxis mg xday which I take when quotshadowsquot start coming also oxygen Lmin for aborting attack This has been working but if start oxygen too late then attack progresses I tried sumatriptan injection for the first time when oxygen failed and attack was in full swing tried sumatryptan injection mg scamazing all symptoms were gone within minutes I will keep trying the oxygen but will definitely use sumatryptan as backup
1190,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42464,8,I dont like it at all Have taken times and causes me to yawn alot and jaw tightness Makes me feel really weird
1191,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,42461,3,Well I was having really bad cluster headaches I took an imitrex for the first time With in mins I was projectile vomiting and having bad stomach cramps The taste stayed in my mouth for hours My headache has went down some but it was still there
1192,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42725,12,I have suffered migraines maybe times a year or so since I was little Usually accompanied by vomiting and complete inability to function The past two years after having my second daughter the migraines have amped up to or a month sometimes more Imitrex works almost always to eliminate the migraine Every once in awhile I wait too long and have to take two I have no side effects to speak of which is crazy to me because I cant even use herbal remedies without experiencing weird side effects Im thankful for the scientists who created this drug I always have it with me just in case and it keeps me from being out for the count with my two little girls
1193,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42717,8,Will not ever touch it again I suffer migraines so bad that I end up in the hospital almost on a regular basis Well my doctor finally prescribed imitrex and I swore up and down that I wouldnt take it due to potential side effects but my head hurt so bad today that I threw in the towel and took one Mind you Im on the mg and it has done nothing but ignore my migraine causing it to manifest into a bigger one
1195,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,42712,0,Took this as given by doctor for migraines I was having daily well never again will I take this tablet Made me feel so unwell I cant describe how I felt Never again
1198,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42703,3,Ive been suffering with migraine for years Tried everything on the market including acupuncture Used imitrex needle injections for many years Learned about sumavel dosepro a few years ago Loved this script Very good success with it However in the past few months I have had injections not fire off or minutes after my attempts the cartridges fired off on my counter Some never fired off and the medicine remained in the injector I contacted Endo and they were helpful Took the information and sent a postage paid envelope to return the defective injections to some lab in California Endo forwarded info to my insurance company for replacements Surprise Im still waiting for these replacements Getting nowhere
1199,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42699,12,This med works well for me in about mins My comment involves the packaging When you are struggling with a bad headache it is extremely stressful trying to open the plastic and foil the pill is sealed in Dont always have scissors at handyAny one else find this annoying Should be changed
1201,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42692,4,Ive been suffering really bad migraines for the last r wks At first i bought over the counter tabs like anadin extra paracetamol ect Altho these meds worked eventualy i would still go between mins in excruciating pain then id get a few hours of relief then it would start al over again it was very exhaustin an so painful Eventualy I went to the doc he prescrided naproxen these tablets didnt even touch the pain after a few days I resorted back to over the counter meds Then I went back to the doctor he prescrided sumatripton tabs yesterday I took my first tab early this morn when I felt the pain The relief was amazing It took the edge of the pain strait away and was barable less than mins the pain was gone Best relief ever
1202,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42691,4,I get migraines mostly when wake up and weather changes Works within minutes A real miracle
1203,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42674,11,I have suffered from migraine for many years Before I started using Imitrex about years ago some migraines would affect me for days I missed out on so much back then Imitrex changed that I normally can take one dose and get complete relief in an hour The only side effect that I have ever suffered is sleepiness but its not so severe that I cant take Imitrex while working if a migraine strikes This medication has been a life saver for me and changed my quality of life
1205,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42656,3,Been experiencing migrainesheadaches since I could remember Im unable to take Nsaids so meds such as Cambia are not an option for me which helped but not as well Daily medications such as Topamax were not effective enough to warrant the extreme fatigue Finally after requesting an quotas neededquot dosing med a doctor prescribed this one Took dose shortly after symptoms began oral tab Took roughly an hour to take effect but it really helped I had option for nd dose but felt enough relief to get through evening Had some side effects but they were tolerable and did not worry me since I read what to expect ahead of time Side effects short lived comared to constant fatigue of alternatives and worth the relief I received
1206,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42652,0,Given this drug to my mother after an hour taking mg she admitted to relieve in her migraine but weakness whole day long but after two days symptoms reappeared so now giving her tricyclic antidepressant mg at bed time only for a month now she feels better
1207,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42635,7,I have had diagnosed migraines for about years have tried many different doctors and medications I just couldnt believe a pain horrible enough to cause vomiting amp wanting to stop living was randomly daignosed as quotmigrainequot No known cause or cure Headaches put me down for two solid days and were sometimes twice per week No life I was prescribed Sumatriptan mg tablets amp OMG miraculous Take one at the onset of headache amp its gone in around minutes Tightness in shouldes chest quickly passes My life has been changed by this medication I am so thankful I have no other side affects alert amp able to go about my lifejob YAAAYYYY
1210,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,42628,0,Relieved migraine and reduced temperature in minutes first time has never taken longer than mins to act Quite impressed with this worked when codeine and others failed
1211,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42624,5,I love this medicine when it works Recently Ive had a problem with it failing to inject I will press it on my leg and nothing happens Ive reported the problem to ENDO and never heard back I also reported the problem to CVS In both cases I turned over the nonworking needle less shots I really depend on this medicine when I have migraines because it works like a charm but i find the injections to be unreliable
1212,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42622,1,I have been a long time sufferer of migraines for years on my life and I am so half of my life I have been on many many daily meds and meds to take to help with the pain to heavy narcotics This is the ONLY inject able that helps with my migraines I try my normal thing of IB Profin and a benadryl and if that does not work after a few hours I use Sumavel DosePro and with in minutes of the time I am migraine free and ready to go though my day This works for onsets to walking up with a full blown migraine
1213,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42619,10,Imitrex works wellto rid me of my migraines a few hours after I have taken it but the side effects for me are pretty bad It makes me feel really weird and it seems like my whole body is achy and muscles are burning Of course the side effects that I get from this medicine is nothing compared to a full blown migraine hence why Ive been taking it all these years I will be talking with my doctor at my next visit though about switching medicines because Im sick of feeling like crap after taking it
1215,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,42614,3,I love this medicine I suffer from eye pain then a knot in my back muscle then vision aura and light flashes then here it comes the vice feeling in my right side of my head That knaws at me all day unless I take sumatriptan within minutes Im a new person The only down fall is my doctor wont let me take more than a week period So I suffer in between nothing else works this medicine is s miracle worker
1216,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42612,10,Ive had migraines since age so years I received Imitrex at and am forever grateful I average one migraine every months usually wchanges in weather andor interrupted or reduced sleep If I recognize the aura phase usually smells sometimes halos or light streakstrails and take Imitrex within the first couple of hours it can completely ward off the pain If I dont catch it in the aura and take it after actual pain hits its still helpful but I will still be subject to days pain and need recurring doses plus I supplement Imitrex with naproxen and caffeine But it works Ive gone from being bedbound in a dark silent room to being able to work even wflourescent lights without vomiting or worse Life changing
1217,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42460,5,If you are a migraine sufferer this is a MIRACLE DRUG Yes the quotinjectionquot is sort of painful for like secs and I only experienced a little soreness in the spot afterwards But within mins of the injection my DEBILITATING MIGRAINE WITH NAUSEA AND BLURRED VISION WAS GONE I was able to head to work and put in a full hours as normal No nausea no follow up dosage no pills just a little sleepiness Im a yr old female that suffers from migraines with vomiting light sensitivity blurred vision per month Yes they are expensive but I am lucky enough to have great insurance coverage thru my employer and only pay per mon for of these
1218,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42458,6,I saw the ad for Zecuity in a magazine a month or so ago The whole process to get the patches takes a long time weeks to a month or more I have migraines maybe every other month but they can be severe with vomiting lasting two days not counting the migraine hangover afterwards I usually take narcotics and have Zofran for the nausea but if I wake up with a full blown migraine the meds dont stay down even with the Zofran The patch is complicated to set up but it worked Sunday I had a migraine it didnt work as well and I have a raised red circular welt on my arm that itches like anything I am going to the doctor tomorrow so Ill check it out with him I hope it works better the next time
1220,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,42454,0,I took one Sumatriptan tablet when the migraine aura began I found that it upset my stomach and wasnt as effective for headache pain as Excedrin Migraine
1222,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42439,3,Ive been experiencing migraines ever since I was around or When I went on birth control they started getting a little better except for when I was either really stressed or on my period both times when they are really bad I talked to my doctor about it and she put me on imatrex which I tried for the first time when I was when my sister took it and it works wonders It alleviates the headache in about minutes The thing Ive noticed that is its best when you first start to feel a migraine coming on not when youre migraine is already unbearable Ive also experienced some minor side affects like drowsiness and some minor stomach pains usually only if i take it on an empty stomach but other than that Ive had no issue
1223,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42436,1,I started by taking imitrex pills and now am using the nasal spray it works so much quicker But I have the foul taste after taking it
1224,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,42417,1,Made me more sick
1226,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42397,6,Pain would cease within minutes
1227,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42395,3,Straight at onset injected and pain gone within a matter of minutes Where have you been all my life
1228,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42381,8,Im only and I was prescribed it at and told only to take it when my migraines were unbearable Every time I have taken it I usually get a really sick feeling such as hot flashes weakness nausea and dizzy Theres always like a feeling that my brain is being frozen over from where the migraine mostly is But I always take it and go straight to sleep except for last night I stayed up and I was seeing and hearing things that werent there I couldnt do simple tasks I forgot where my room was after my boyfriend told me to drink some water I cried over everything I was scared of everything Staying awake for me was horrifying
1229,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42376,7,I took one pill at onset then took a second pill after hours of no relief as directed I spent a total of hours puking and uncoordinated except for the hour the nd pill knocked me out with drowsiness My migraine never subsided and continued to rage in full force during and after the side effects Will not take again
1230,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,42364,24,I am a long time sufferer of frequent chronic migraines up to a month I have used sumatriptan since it became available both in pill form and selfinjection Yesterday I tried the new patch ldquoZecuityrdquo for the first time and likely the last The actual cost per patch is about The packaging is ridiculous a box overnight delivered which was about two feet square with a weight of about pounds It contained a large thick styrofoam container six special red ldquoPureTemp Bricksrdquo designed to keep the drug at room temperature it must be kept between it degrees FahrenheitndashNOT refrigerated and a box of four patches The patches themselves contain the medication but also the ldquoreleasedeliveryrdquo system which includes a computer chip the red light to indicate activation and completion of medication delivery four hoursndashthen the light turns off and patch can be removed and two lithiummanganese dioxide batteries perchlorate material which are considered TOXIC WASTE by the federal government and cannot be thrown away in the regular trash Instructions say to contact your local authorities to inquire how to properly and legally dispose of the used patches The above in and of itself should give most people pause as to whether this is all worth it But as anyone who is suffering from a migraine will tell you the pain and other symptoms are so bad you feel like yoursquod try practically anything So hey even though this is the same drug maybe this fancy delivery system is the magic relief we have been searching for Personally sumatriptan lessons the duration and severity of my migraines but has never ldquorelievedrsquo them It may for some but not for me Other than the powerful narcotics I take for other chronic pain itrsquos the only other thing that helps at all Of course there are strict limits on the number of times it can be used per month for safety reasons so I can only use it for my worst migraines The limit on the patches no more than four per month So okay I decide to give them a try I followed all of the somewhat detailed and involved instructions and ldquoactivate itrdquo apply it and push the ldquostartrdquo button and the little red light comes on Within a few minutes I start to feel a tingling itchy burning sensation though not too bad and certainly not unbearable or even anything as bad as the pain of the migraine Within about five minutes the gel I assume the medication starts to ooze out the sides of the patch making a sticky mess and of course causing the adhesive of the patch to stop working and the thing starts to practically fall off Okay the directions say if there are problems with the patch staying in place to use medical tape So I use medical tape All around the entire patch I use medical tape Five minutes later even the medical tape starts to come loose due to the ozzing gel so I apply even more tape a lot of tape I am also concerned that there is more medicine sticking to the tape than being absorbed into my body I also only feel very slightly any effect of the sumatriptan I felt a mild burning sensation the entire time the patch was on as well as red irritated itchy rashy skin upon removal Oh yeah and now what the heck do I do with this environmentally hazardous medical waste Are most users really going to properly dispose of these things As far a headache relief obviously intramuscular injection is a quicker way of getting this drug into your body to provide whatever amount of relief you are going to get from it as quickly as possible Another consideration my health insurance required Prior Approval to cover the patches part of which was a statement from me and my doctor that the other forms of ingestion of sumatriptan pill selfinjection intranasal spray were inadequate and that I required the patches When I found that out I refused and told my doctor to do the same I had little faith that a hour patch of the same drug would work better than a second injection and I did not want to give up my ability to keep receiving the injections The drug company provided the one month free trial four patches so I agreed to try them Several years ago I remember how happy I was when Imetrix finally went generic and I was able to obtain sumatriptan much cheaper It saved me and my insurance company a lot of money I donrsquot really want to give that up either So I suppose that there are people who may find these patches amazing and effective especially those who for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to use the selfinjections For me however considering all of the factors above I think Irsquoll stick with the injectable pun intended and sometimes the pills as I donrsquot like to carry the autoinjections around in my purse I already have to carry an epipen with mehellip I wish the best to other migraine sufferers perhaps the patches will give them the relief they seek For me however they are not the answer
1231,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42360,16,I have been suffering from migraines since around and now at although they have became less frequent over the years They are horrible as I usually am out for the entire day bedridden in a dark room I have always been very paranoid to try a actual migraine medicine so have taken vicodin for the pain I recently had a migraine at work and decided to try a imitrex my doctor prescribed me I was nervous to try it but am so happy I did I waited a few minutes of having the migraine before I took it but it relieved me of my migraine within minutes I did experience some effects like muscle stiffness in my neck tightness in my face and a burning feeling in my nose and forehead for about a hour but Ill take that any day over a migraine
1232,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42349,9,Helpless migraine victim for years My Dr Recommended imitrex so I took it I took one mg it tasted horrible I had an upset stomach for almost hours I did get a heartburn feeling in my chest hotflash mood swings but my Migraine disappeared I will speak to my neurologist regarding my side effects I would consider using imitrex again in the future
1233,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42337,6,Ive used sumatriptan for about years to treat my migraines that Ive had since I was Theyre mostly period and stress related headaches Nothing had ever helped and Im excited that I can finally get on with my life without laying bed for days suffering in pain It works pretty quickly or minutes after I take the medication Its a life saverIt does make my extremities tingly and sensitive to heat and cold But overall Im thankful to have an option
1236,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42322,3,Had clusters years now Ive tried literally EVERYTHING out there The only thing that works for immediate relief is imitrex injections If med takes too long nasal or pill it simply doesnt work Gabapentin sp regime should be started immediately they eventually stop the nerve from spasms Imitrex is now available generic sumatriptan however still expensive I pay shot only available as a twopack
1237,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42316,2,This RX did not work for me My migraine went from a pain level to a after I took it
1238,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42314,7,After years of taking this medicine it has lead up to hair thinning out severely full body muscle pain and weakness as a side effect and a possible stroke It works to get rid of the migraine but this what happens when you take it long term
1239,Sumatriptan,Migraine,4,42313,4,I have been suffering from migraines for over years My migraines are hormonal but also stress related First time I took sumatriptan I couldnt believe how effective it was My migraine disappeared in only minutes and I was able to live my life as a quotnormalquot person instead of lying on bed all day Unfortunately the magic only lasted a few times I realised every time I had a migraine it took longer and longer for the drug to act And also my migraines were more frequent since I began using sumatriptan I stopped taking this triptan and my doctor suggested another one zolmitriptan which is working really well for me and I only have migraine per month now
1240,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42296,4,I swear Sumatriptan injections saved my life My new best friend I never leave home without them
1241,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42296,5,Sumatriptan is a life changer Ive suffered from cluster headaches for years having one at least once a week and NOTHING has ever come close to helping Now I havent had one in months I take a pill when I feel a cluster headache coming which successfully aborts it Even hours into a full blown attack I took a pill and relieved of the pain Another great thing My insurance covers it Even better it is only for pills you can break them in half and have without insurance
1242,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42089,1,I have been a cluster headache suffer for yearsMy Dad suffers as wellI remember him sitting in a chair day after day night after night with no real relief I never could understand or know how intense the attacks were until I started with minelucky my dad was prescribed Imitrex in the s at the beginning of mine his words and mine are that this drug is a god send for us suffersMy issue is now my insurance company will only approve boxes of shots per month So my only way is to stock pile these boxes every month until my next attackwell Im out and now I wiil use coupons or any other way to purchase these on my own to try to save Sad UHC will not approve the number of shots needed for each episode
1243,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42075,5,I can make the injections last by using only a vial per cluster attack I take the vial out of the auto injector and use a qtip to press in the amount After this I wait exactly minutes and the headache is gone I had a very hard time getting enough injections from my insurance to cover all the cluster headaches I was getting and this method helped me handle x more than I could before I do feel my headache pain jumping from a gt immediately after injection Taking the mg tablets does not cause this increase in pain but the wait is about mins for relief Sometimes I can tell which headaches to use either the injection or pill for
1244,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42060,15,I have suffered from migraines for many years but menopause has made the headaches both more intense and frequent The only medication that helps is Sumatriptan Typically the headache is gone within minutes although it usually gets a little worse before it gets better There are side effects most notably jaw pain difficulty swallowing and a quotspaceyquot feeling but honestly these are minor compared with the agony of a migraine I love this medication and do not know how I would manage without it
1246,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42044,2,I was recently prescribed Imigran the European version of Imitrex for Acute Cluster Headache in the injection form pretty much life changing Id previously tried Oral Sumatriptan for Cluster Headaches but that just did not seem effective and once a full blown attack had started the pill did not seem to abort the headache Injectable Sumatriptan though has proved to be a totally different thing and even when the pain is at its peak once injected its probably minutes maximum before the headache is gone totally gone Ive suffered from Cluster Headaches for many years and only wish Id tried this sooner for me it has been just brilliant Having used it several times now have not had any side effects whatsoever fantastic
1247,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10,42040,6,Ive suffered from cyclic vomiting for over years and the only thing that brings me reliefIve suffered for over a week before with the intense vomiting and dibilitating migraines and had to be hospitalized due to dehydration and pain and panic attacksMy GP actually prescribed me the injectable form and at the first sign I take an injection then usually wait minutes and give myself a second injection and this medication has saved my life
1248,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42028,19,Thank you SCIENCE for this medication My migraines used to immobilize me and now I finally have relief thanks to this med Better living through modern science
1249,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42024,18,I have had debilitating migraines since I was a very young child diagnosed at first week of Primary school My childhood is filled with memories of regular migraines and nothing would touch them I started taking Sumatriptan in and my life changed dramatically for the betterIf taken at the first sign of a migraine it works brilliantly I have taken regularly for years usually tabs per week depending on frequency of migraine I am wondering if anyone else has taken longterm and wonder if any other side effects occur
1250,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42022,19,Works well for my migraines First couple of times taking it caused my jaw to feel tight and makes me pretty sleepy
1251,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42020,4,Ive had migraines as young as years old It was horrible every time I got one I was too young to understand that it was a migraine At last when I was years old I began reading more about migraines and knew that I had them The first time ever taking Sumatriptan succinate I felt so relieved and almost migraine free Sometimes I feel tenderness in my jaw and neck but after mins I feel great
1254,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41964,10,After three solid weeks with vestibular migraine tinnitis nausea and no sleep I have finally found what works Mild dizziness especially when bending tinnitis is there no dopey feeling and I am finally relaxed I tried EVERYTHING elseTopomax was a disaster B shot heatcold alcohol no alcohol diet sleep Toradol Benedryl shot Phenergan only way to sleep and not be sick Thank goodness too bad I have no insurance and it costs A FORTUNE
1256,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,1,41948,6,Havent seen many people with my experience so I appreciate Housewifeandmothers input below Maybe my problem is also with generic sumatriptan Maybe my dose at mg is too high But out of times after taking it I became horribly nauseous and vomited the pill up within minutes of taking it Im afraid to ever go near it again Still looking for relief from my daily crippling headaches Vicodin and Hydrocodone seem to be the only thing to relieve my pain Started taking magnesium supplements as well but no improvement yet But FYI I think my experience is uncommon
1257,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41946,19,Great Ive taken it twice and didnt experience any major side effects Kicked in after minutes was fully ready to go at minutes after That said I did experience some side effects includingmild heartburnlike feeling during the first hours after taking itmoderate heavinesstightness in my jaw that lasted just about hours after takingsome drowsinesssome mild neck pain which could have been the migrainea tightnesstingling very mild in my forearmsBut Im free and clear of the headache Definitely plan on taking again
1258,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41942,17,Best migraine medicine I have ever used The injection does hurt for a few seconds but the pain is gone as fast as it came Within a few minutes I can feel the medicine rushing through my head It feels very heavy and leaves me with a dizzy sensation I usually need about an hour of sleep and then the migraine is gone completely I suffer about three migraines a week and only need a second dose about once a month Pretty effective if you ask me I have noticed that if I am feeling nauseous already the medicine intensifies this I found that taking a sublingual anti nausea medicine a few minutes before the injection greatly reduces this side effect
1259,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41935,13,Taken at the beginning of symptoms it stops the headache within minutes
1260,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41932,2,Cluster sufferer
1261,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41904,40,My husband has always whats called prostrating attacks which is a form of a migraine that leaves him in so much pain he cant function at all The only medication that has ever worked on him is the Imitrex This stuff is awesome The only thing that is irritating is every time I get his prescription filled the pharmacist try to give him the Sumatriptan the generic version which makes him so sick he will throw up nonstop for hours So I always have to tell them he needs the name brand and I have gotten into many arguments with pharmacists trying to tell me its the same thing ITS NOT When my husband takes Imitrex his migraine is gone within minutes he takes a Sumatriptan and I feel like I need to take him to a hospital
1262,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41896,9,I would NOT have a life without it Ive tried everything Nothing works for me but this Ive been on it years I started out with pen injections then nose spraypill suits me best I dont wish these on anyone Migraines are horrible
1263,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41879,6,Imitrex is truly a miracle for me It has given me my life back
1264,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41871,4,I have had migraines since my late teens I used to take Fiornal but discovered Imitrex which has been a life saver I get migraines with aura followed by pain I use the nasal Imitrex and I find that if I take Imitrex at the onset of my vision loss I am usually able to stop the vision problem as well as stop the migraine within minutes This medication has been a lifesaver for me The only side effect with the nasal spray for me is that it tastes HORRIBLE in the back of my throat and it makes me a bit sickly feeling but all in all Id rather have it than not
1265,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,41855,23,Imitrex did not work for me I have not reached the vomiting stage of a migraine in years thanks to other medications Imitrex did nothing to stop the progression of my migraine I had to leave work in the middle of the afternoon feeling as if I would vomit at my desk in the hallway in the elevator walking to the parking garage the entire way Aleve works better than this stuff and Aleve only keeps nausea at bay but does not cure migraines for me
1266,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41836,16,I have had migraines since my teens and until I was prescribed the Imitrex Injectable I suffered severely I thank GOD for this medicine and cant imagine life without it
1268,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,41822,29,Imitrex in any form is the Best med for Cluster headaches by far High flow oxygen at first twinge and the pill at the onset even if you think it might hurt Most effective You all know how fast they come on Usually work immediately unless late in a cycle I too wish you could take more than twice in a hr period After suffering for almost yrs with no medicine at All For these crippling things I have tried all Imitrex types injections pills nasal sprays Injections are fast but so very expensive and painful as well Nasal spray is nauseating for me the pill form has always worked well if taken at the very BLINK of headache Because of price and insurance restrictions I would wait to take the medicine Not anymore
1269,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,41812,17,I have been using Imitrex since it first came out in the s It was a God send Ive had migraines for years I get about six migraines a month Imitrex always works BUT for me I pay a price with stomach aches Sometimes I refrain from taking Imitrex for fear of the stomach pains
1270,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41802,10,I had a few small reactions but it took care of it and it was gone after some sleep
1272,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41770,6,The injectable version works well for my infrequent every months migraines It stops them dead in their tracks The only downside is it leaves me feeling a little out of as if Id better not operate any heavy machineryI also err by not taking it as soon as the pain hits Thats because I hate jabbing myself with a needle Bizarrely I also get migraines with aura but no pain The aura is only visible in my left eye and looks like fluttering black fringe So weird The first time it happened I was sure I was having a brain bleed When it went away without my dying or having a stroke I figured it was just my brain chemistry throwing a party one with black streamers
1274,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,41737,6,I get migraines with aura Right when I begin to lose my vision I know the migraine is minutes away I take an Imitrex as soon as I start to lose my vision It works within an hour or two about of the time I feel very weak and quotout of itquot when I do take one It still doesnt help with nausea however I have not thrown up from a migraine yet just very nauseousI have also used the injectable version That works SO much better However I have psyched myself out and can no longer give myself a shot for some reasonPhysical Therapy has really helped with my migraines I also quit going to the chiropractor I used to get migraines weekly now its been months and I finally got one today
1275,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41734,6,Have had migraines on and off for years I used Fioricet the last yearswith good results but then my system must have changed that they did not work anymoreAfter talking to an Neurologist and having blood work etc done she putme on Imitrex Sumatriptan mg which worked great Only thing I do is split these into mg pieces and they still work goodFrom reading on different forums I did notice a lot of our fellow migrainesufferers get relief from to mg Also I have not had any side effects taking the mgOnly negative for me is that they are pricey about for pills Whynine who knows but they work and its worth it to me
1276,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41726,28,First month prescription for mg tablets If I take at the first sign of headache goes away about min If wait to take tablet takes up two hours for the pain to stop Since I have daily migraines tried waiting to save tablets concerned run out of mg tablets prior to refill date The Imitrex has been God sent for me I have had migraines since my teens now in my sixities Migranies only health probem I have Plan to call my doctor let know how well Imitrex works for me and see if day prescription or stronger prescription is what I need From other reviews appears some users go days between headaches that would be more than I ever expected after all these years
1277,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41699,9,I have had migraines ever since I can recall my earliest headaches Im lucky that mine progress slowly giving me time to take either ibuprofen or naproxen to take care of the majority of my migraines That said every once in a while I get a acute enough or resistant enough attack that I take Imitex sumatriptan and usually within min my migraines are less severe and within an hour completely resolved I do however have odd side effects If I feel nauseous prior to taking Imitrex it makes my nausea more severe Every time I use sumatriptan my body feels run down and weak almost as if I have taken a muscle relaxer Regardless it is a Godsend when I need it I have mg pills that I cut into quarters I usually only need mg
1278,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41694,43,I come from a family where everyone has terrible migraines When I started getting them at age I resorted to taking loads of Tylenol with Pesudophedrine to quotmaskquot the pain which took a heavy toll on my liver Someone suggested that I look into the Triptan family of migraine medication After going through a few different ones I found Imitrex to be an absolute lifesaver Whenever I feel one coming I take mg and the migraine usually disappears within minutes If I wait a few hours to take it the response time could be more like minutes With migraines a month Imitrex is essentially the only thing that allows me to function I have not seen any real side effects
1279,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41679,9,This pill has completely changed my life I highly recommend it to anyone that suffers from migraines As soon as you feel the symptoms you take it and it goes away in a half hour to an hour and if it doesnt you take another one and it will go away I suffer from migraines and had to be in bed for sometime days This really works for me
1281,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41624,11,Took my husband to doctor while suffering a severe migraine with vomiting which he has suffered from his whole life a month to the point of vomiting After not being able to keep down pills this was his only hope of relief Had first injection at doctors office and within minutes he had relief and was even able to go in to work the same day I am so happy there is something that cures his pain He said the shot hurt but it was worth it The cost is high but also worth it when he is in that much pain We paid with discount card for injections You can find the discount card on their website HIGHLY RECOMMEND when nothing else has helped
1282,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41623,22,I have suffered from debilitating migraines for over years I feel like I have tried everything Imitrex shots gave me my life back After taking a shot I normally need to lay down for min but then I feel great I used to suffer for at least days I never had any side effects
1283,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41621,3,I have extremely bad migraines and have tried several different medicines Imitrex stat dose injections have really been a lifesaver
1284,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,41612,24,This is a miracle for me Cluster headaches would put me out of commission for days Imitrex gets rid of the intense pain of my eye feeling like it might pop out of my head The first few times I took it I had side effects of the heavy feeling on my chest and in my muscles after x I can take with no side effects Ive only taken it x but still working great
1286,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,41594,18,Works super fast and well Gets rid of my migraines fast when I take with a Motrin BUTit makes me sweat buckets I took it at work before my shift and hours later my migraine was gone but I had sweated through shirts and was visibly dripping It was pretty bad It does it every time I take it so I try not to use it if I can help it
1287,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41587,23,I have taken Imitrex ever since it came out in the s It works and Ill be forever grateful that it does If you like me know what it was like to get migraines before Imitrex came out youll understand why I sing its praise
1288,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41540,9,Severe MigrainesCluster Headaches years Intensityfrequency varies intensity is around point scale frequency is around per week some lasting days I have tried many medications most Triptans Maxalt Zomig Relpax Frova Axert works well for me but when it doesnt I use Alsuma Injection It works like a Epipen injection you give yourself Place the pen against your skin and push hard There is a jolt and then the needle point emerges and you keep it there for seconds The pain from the prick is not bad because the needle is small The jolt is kinda scary I have to brace myself but way worth it It WORKS Some nausea but not much other side effects I usually go to sleep right after I take it
1289,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41538,20,The only medication that works for my migraines that last typically days at a time right side of my head in my eye down the back of my neck and upper back I take the mg tablet every hours or when I feel it coming back on Imitrex kicks in within minutes of taking it As close to instant relief as you can get GREAT medication
1290,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,41516,8,Its quick acting but painful and it made me bruise and bleed a bit It makes me feel nauseated and I vomited once a few minutes after use It also made me feel sleepy like my other migraine pills This just acts quicker and makes you drowsy fast
1291,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41503,17,The injection feels like a rubber band snapped on your skin I recommend the abdomen over the thigh much more comfortable I only bleed slightly and the site only bruised once The triptan effect is fast and intense you feel that rush of the migraine about to go away It makes me sleepy as sumatriptan always has and I nap for less than hour then I am PAIN FREE The nice thing is the triptan effect goes away as rapidly as it comes on which is far better than the lingering quotyuckquot feeling with oral triptans Not just pain reduction not a lessening of the migraine it is gone It has reduced my sick and late days due to migraine from days in to ZERO so far in Will never go without it again
1292,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42291,3,Imitrex shot is a very effective drug for me Have had migraines for decades and was introduced to imitrex after years of having blinding aura then days of suffering in a dark room Imitrex shot works within minutes No pain killer needed Once I give myself the shot I lay down for about an hour Only issues are brief fatigue nausea for a few minutes and a strange prickly sensation in the top of my head which goes away quickly
1293,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42289,4,So far this medications does help but it makes me very sleepy Generally when I get a bad migraine its debilitating I usually leave work and in bed for the rest of the day So far Ive taken this medication twice and it helps rid the migraine andor lessens it to a dull headache then I need to rest stay hydrated no lights noise or strong smells
1294,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42286,4,Ive been a migraine sufferer since I was years old My Dr prescribed sumatriptan years ago and honestly now I cant live without it I take one tablet and within mins the migraine is completely gone Side effects for me are hot flushes for a few hrs and I have really achy heavy joints the next day anybody else get these side effects
1296,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42265,15,I have tried this medication in the past and it did not work for me but now after revisiting the drug with years of migraines of no relief I have found that it works well for me now I tend to have extreme nausea and vomiting with my severe headaches so I also use the nasal spay form depending on how nauseated I am They both work well if taken early in the migraine I did however have severe reaction the first times taking it nausea vomiting abdominal upset but I forced myself to take it again Now my experience is quothead tighteningquot which I see can be common with this drug and after about minutes of this I feel a quotlooseningquot and finally relief I have not experienced any other symptoms with tablet form
1298,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42257,1,Works in about minutes for me which is about twice as fast as the pill form Creates a bad taste but well worth it for the faster speed
1299,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42246,1,Sumatriptan tablet is very good within half an hour there a big difference I take it with pain killers and it works wonders Cupping it very good for migraines I know a few people that have done cupping on there head n migraines the have gone
1300,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42241,11,I have been getting migraines off and on since around the age of and am now Most of my migraines are due to my allergies during the springsummer But they seem to be even worse during the colder months This medication works wonders for me The only thing I seem to notice is a bit of dizziness after the medicene wears off But I would much rather have a little dizziness rather than being bedridden lightsound sensitivity migraine and nauseavomiting
1302,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42216,2,Ive suffered from cluster headaches for the last years since I was diagnosed with a growth on my pineal gland Nothing worked until I was put under neurology science in York UK I was put on verapamil tablets and also prednisolone to prevent and sumatriptan as a pain relief when I have an attack I was close to drilling a hole on the side of my head before I was prescribed these meds The problem is they are expensive I am lucky and I have these prescribed under the NHS however they will not prescribe me more than injections per week and sometimes I have these attaches every day sown times twice a day for to weeks Sumitriptan is the best thing ever invented
1303,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42207,11,This drug give me hallucinations And made my body tingle
1304,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42205,5,I take Sumatriptan for menstrual migraines and this medication has been an absolute lifesaver for me If I take a mg tablet when the migraine starts I have relief within minutes If I wait until the migraine is really bad then it takes about an hour to kick in My migraines generally last days and the first dose wears off in about hours so I usually have to take another dose The only side effects I experience are a slight head rush that goes away after about minutes I would recommend trying to take a nap after taking this medication which really helps
1305,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,42175,4,I took this medication as soon as I felt a migraine coming It did not ease the pain I was in bed from pm till am the next day I was hoping I would get better results since its very expensive
1306,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42153,20,Saved my life Nothing else worked Other drugs intensified the headache I much prefer the injection Less of the drug is needed and the effective result occurs more quicklySide effects I can get nightsleep sweats and have quotoddquot dreams that do not otherwise occur
1307,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42149,13,Imatrex has helped me with my cluster headaches Certain foods trigger these painful headaches and even though I know most of the triggers and even though I try to avoid them its impossible to eat and not have at least one or two of these triggers in my food My doctor tried me on several pain meds for these headaches but nothing worked The headaches got so bad I was literally pulling my hair out and was thinking about suicide Then my doctor gave me Imatrex As long as I know I have access to Imatrex I am fine I finally went to a wonderful neurologist who has been very patient in trying other meds to work with the Imatrex I do take the generic of Imatrex
1308,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42142,10,From the moment I started taking Imitrex in it has worked wonderfully for me with probably only two or three occasions over the years where a headache has persistent It is been my wonder drug I do get very frequent migraines and take as little of it is possible but I will normally take to mg tablets per month with few if any side effects
1309,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,9,42131,6,Ive suffered with tension headache and migraine for years and nothing has ever really helped with the pain until now As soon as I feel one coming one I take one tablet and the pain is gone with minutes The only downside to using this medicine is the side effects I have Hot flushes and a heavy burning sensation in my legs almost like growing pains But I much rather the side effects than the headache
1310,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42129,13,This medication has changed my life I have had migraine since I was age My son lost a lot of time and attention from me because I used to be debilated for from early morning until about pm Only when my doctor prescribed Sumatriptan for me about years ago I have got back quality of life I thank from the bottom of my heart whoever invented this medication Thankfully in UK we have the National Health Service which means I dont have to pay for the medication I probably would find it hard to afford otherwise I worry about all the people around the world who suffer migraine and do not have access to Sumatriptan Forget all the wealth Health is the true wealth for me Thank you Sumatriptan
1313,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42119,3,I cant believe all the great ratings for this Maybe my skin is just extremely sensitive but this was the most painful injection Ive ever had in my entire life I choose though over belly and I actually screamed so loudly Im sure I scared everyone in the reception area I was not at all prepared for it to hurt as much as it did The unexpected sharp pain only made my headache worse and even paired with a shot of Demerol my headache did not clear
1315,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42104,10,Ive been using Sumavel Dosepro and Sumavel pill form for over years The Dosepro has relievederased my migraine in less than minutes of the time Its liquid gold in my opinion The pill form is less effective and takes up to hr
1316,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42096,15,days on medicine caused extreme muscle pains tiredness and weakness Also facial flushing tingling hot and cold flashes blurred vision malaise increased urination lack of concentration
1317,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41494,10,Ive been dealing with episodes of cluster headaches for years Nothing has ever made a dent in the pain besides this and Zomig nasal spray The slight pain of the injection is a very small price to pay to relieve the crushing pain of a cluster headache For me the trick for both medicines is to catch it as early as possible before the headache is full blown Im never more than a minute or two away from a dose Besides feeling a little weak afterwards which would have been worse with the headache anyway so far I dont have any real side effects
1318,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41491,24,Imitrex has truly been a miracle for me Im and Ive been having terrible headaches since as far back as I can remember No over the counter medication ever made any difference in the pain at all years ago I was prescribed Imitrex and it has literally changed my life It normally takes an hour or two for it to kick in for me but when it does it completely takes my headache away I have never had any side effects either
1319,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41484,12,Im yrs old and was diagnosed with cluster headaches in my late s I was prescribed sumatriptan last week due to my new spell which started weeks ago and the medicine is working great for me When ones coming on I take a mg pill and it starts working within minutes I feel and hear crackling noises in my head as well as my nasal cavity and eye socket and miraculously it starts to lift away In some cases though I had to take a second pill because the first didnt work completely but within to minutes Im relaxed and pain free Since theyve taken Cafergot off the market Ive been without any medicine at all trying steroids my neurologist experimented with which didnt work at all Sumatriptan is working
1320,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41476,16,This is a miracle for migraines Works within minutes and migraine GONE You will have energy and get on with your day I am yrs old and have suffered with migraines since teen RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN TO YOUR DR AND ASK FOR THIS MEDICINE SUFFER NO MORE
1322,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41451,28,I completely rely on Imitrex Once I had this the daylong headaches are gone I now know that what I used to call quotsinus headachesquot were migraines I had since a teenager though not bad until into my s My side effects are a little sleepiness and maybe some tiredness but nothing compared to the debilitation of a migraine However I am much more aggressive with eliminating triggers particularly MSG and processed foods and this helps My better diet has reduced my need for Imitrex down to times a month
1323,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,41450,7,I have suffered migraines since I was in grade school Im now My headaches used to come on in the late afternoon and put me in bed for the rest of the day but I would wake up next morning feeling ok Now my headaches come on about in the morning and last days of non stop vomiting and pain The doctor put me on Topamax daily but the side effects keep causing me to overheat in the Texas weather The doctor just put me on sumatriptan mg and I just had an attack days ago I took pill and it did nothing hours later I took a second dose and I still ended up in bed for hours
1324,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41450,15,This medication works for me I did have slight chest discomfort first few times using it No longer experience it Sometimes it makes me feel tired but I continue on and it goes away Headache disappears within mins to hr of taking tablet I have been taking Imitrex and sumatriptan for over years and am thankful the neurologist prescribed it
1325,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41448,14,I suffered for several years before I found a specialist who diagnosed me properly and prescribed this great medicine
1327,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,41441,27,Migraines have become my worst enemy over the past years Thank goodness for Imitrex I started with the pills then the nasal spray and have worked my way up to the shots plus nausea medicines The pills had the least side effects The spray was vile tasting but fast acting and I could take it while working When my headaches worsened they added botox and upgraded me to the injected version I needed something that acted FAST so I could stay in the classroom The down side to the injection is the head rush change of hear rate and the flushing feeling When I inject I have about BAD minutes then I kind of restabilize and about an hour later I usually feel better and capable of continuing to teach
1328,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41439,22,I have migraines that are hormonal in nature and Imitrex has saved me from days worth of pain many a time I also have a gradeschool daughter and if I have a migraine believe me the entire family suffers The pain from a migraine can last days for me so having something that will knock it out in a matter of minutes is in my eyes miraculous It doesnt ALWAYS work especially if I have cluster headaches but of the time it works for me on one dose If the first dose doesnt work I take another and that usually just completely wipes it out
1329,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41427,15,Amazing and totally effective andno side affects
1330,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41395,10,Ive been suffering from headache for over years Headache could last up to a week it was horrible Took so many pain medicines and it didnt work I ended up with craniotomy last year and metal plates on my skull bone I was fine for few monthsno headache Few months ago the headaches came back again Now Im miserable again when the headache comeI got this injection Sumavel DoseProafter the injection my head feels like it explodes and I fell asleep right awayafter an hourtwo the headache is goneits great medicineits working right awaythrough the skin and blood vessels
1332,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41381,7,This medication for the price worked the best I was using this along with Topamax as a daily preventative and also started receiving botox injections I found that after a few months between the botox the Topamax and the Imitrex I was able to use less and less each month
1333,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41377,8,After years of migraines that lasted three days at a time and nothing working to get rid of them this is awesome I was worried about being able to do the injection myself but it wasnt bad It felt like a bee sting Within a minute it felt like the top of my head was going to explode Within minutes it was subsiding It was completely gone in less than an hour There was no quotbuzzy worn out feelingquot like I normally have after my migraines I had plenty of energy and felt great The prescription discount card is a great help too
1334,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10,41373,4,The best medication I have ever taken for my migraines Works fast and I very rarely have to take a second dose I rated it as a
1335,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41346,13,Before Imitrex I had Migraines that would last day I finally went to emergency to get a shot of Demerol and then sometimes it would not workI would be right there with my bowl amp sun glass on waiting my turn I was put on Imitrex when it first came out and the long term effect was not for sure on people Anything is better than a migraine headache I started taking the shots and at first it made me feel a little funny for first minute then it cleared up and within minutes my migraine was gone After using it for a while I developed an immunity to it I then had to use shots My doctor at the time had me stop using it It WAS a great medication for Migraines back then
1337,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,5,41313,6,This is the first time I have used Sumatriptan it was ArrowSumatriptan injection I immediately felt a slight pressure in my chest and a pushing in my temples and the base of my skull and felt tired and weak There was a tingling sensation in my nose and my throat was ultra sensitive It is an hour since I injected and my cluster headache has eased but not gone away yet My eye has stopped streaming and nose not running so fast and I look slightly more human I had hoped for better than this but it is an improvement
1338,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41282,13,I have been on Imitrex for years now and when my Migraine starts Imitrex takes care of it Only a couple of times I had to take the second pill Im on mg as for side effects I have not had any My doctor has me on Topamax to help control them and I keep my Imitrex with me when I need it
1339,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41271,5,This medicine has changed my life it is a surefire defense against debilitating migraines I can actually feel it pushing the headache out of my head One word of caution however in the rare instance I feel a headache coming on and dont have my meds with me or more likely am out of them since the insurance allows only a pill script the headache that I do get is OFF THE CHARTS Its almost like the migraine monster knows I have no defense
1340,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41263,0,Started with Imitrex when it first came out with the big bulky injector kits then got the Statdose kit two syringes in one cartridges that fit in a case with reusable injector pen Injections for bad migraines tablets if I catch them soon enough
1343,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41249,3,The stat dose is a miracle I can finally go on vacations and dont miss out on work I used to be in tears and would be submitted to hospital for a iv
1344,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,41243,5,Imitrex is the best medication for migraines I have taken so far When I first started using it I would get the loopy feeling and slight dizziness Normal right But after a month or two and a few more uses of this medication I started get a burning sensation in my head behind my eyes and progressively got worse with each time I took it The side effects have gotten so bad that now I get coldhot sweats the burning sensation in my head and vomiting I have now switched to a medication that is the prescription strength of Motrin which works just as well
1345,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41224,0,Sumatriptan has changed my life A migraine used to leave me down for the count for hours Now within about minutes my migraines are completely gone I have not experienced any side effects
1346,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,41214,18,This medicine kept the migraine from becoming full blown It made me sleepy and out of sorts but this is better than an agonizing migraine I took it as soon as I saw the visual effect and within min my vision was back to normal However I still had a mild migraine with very little nausea Imitrex made me tired and my body felt heavy It also made my tongue feel swollen but it wasnt But Id take this over a full blown migraine any day It seemed to fast forward the headache rather than it being debilitating like last time I still lay around all day though
1347,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,41198,6,At first I suffered through them This included splitting head pain nausea and vomiting I started using Excedrin after a while which helped if I took it right away Then that started to not work so well anymore I had one really bad one that lasted hours I was still throwing up at pm and I was now throwing up blood I went to the ER and when I finally got in they put me on an IV to hydrate me They then added Imitrex to the bag and I soon started feeling side effects My head felt like I was going to pass out My breathing became labored and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest They said that meant it was working After about two minutes everything was gone I got pills to take at home and they worked okay Not as fast
1348,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41188,8,Imitrex works for me even if I let it get to the really bad headachehate to take because of the tightness in chest and achy throat afterwards Butthey do the job and I always say later I should have taken it in the beginning
1349,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41179,8,Imitrex injection is sometimes the only thing that will stop the headache Even when on Verapamil I can get head bangers that blow through when this happens Imitrex can be the added push
1350,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,41162,18,The first time I took this I got a severe panic attack It felt like I couldnt breathe my heart was racing and chest hurt It did nothing for the pain or any of the other things associated with migraines I did try it once more as per my Dr and it happened all over again Maxalt is what I use now
1351,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41153,1,Review for Sumatriptan Succinate Injection Generic ImitrexI was so impressed I was getting too wordy with the review and it cut me off so Ill get to the point After taking the medication through injection the pill is SO slow to work for me my aura was gone in less than minutes and I was able to continue teaching my students throughout the remainder of the school day I still had a headache and minor side effects like hot flashes tension in my shoulders and obviously pain at injection site but I will take those things over a days long migraine ANY DAY I am so impressed with this medication All symptoms were totally gone without even a minute headache by pm that evening
1354,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41083,21,I suffered with cluster headaches for about years before finally receiving an Imitrex injection in the hospital ER My headache was gone within minutes I thought it was a miracle I do not leave home without it
1355,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41079,4,I take the generic Sumatriptan This medicine has changed my life I honestly cant see how I would make it through my days if I didnt have this medicine when a migraine comes along I get migraines times a week Taking it does have side effects as most of the time my arms get heavy and tingly I suggest taking it and then sleeping an hour while it kicks in but sometimes that is not possible and you just have to push through it To me its worth it and definitely worth trying
1356,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41072,12,It worked to abort a cluster headache Just as effective but not any more so than the needle version of Imitrexsumatriptan The injection stung quite a bit and left a fairly nasty welt similar to a wasp sting and it bled a little bit but it worked as advertised
1357,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,8,41065,4,If I take Imitrex Nasal spray mg in first min when symptoms of Cluster Headaches start its great chance that my headaches will last max min but sometimes doesnt work at all
1359,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41014,4,Ive had clusters for as long as I can remember but theyve gotten worse as Ive gotten older First doc prescribed Frova which didnt help at all but the most recent doctor Ive seen prescribed sumatriptan I cant believe how quickly this worked My headaches usually lasted hours even after taking Aleve Sumatriptan has knocked them out in minutes I feel a bit jittery after and have extreme taste sensitivity for a few hours but its well worth it This medicine is a miracle
1360,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41011,7,Those injections for my headaches that the doctor gave me are amazing I wake up with my headache a lot so I cant even stop them before they start and like this morning theyre usually paired with nausea and I end up throwing upThis injection is awesome though Quick relief without having to make a trip to the ER I usually get Toradol shots at the hospital that make the headache disappear within twenty minutes of so The initial injection of the Sumavel hurt a little and caught me off guard but it felt like a bee sting it just hurt for a second and then it was over It bled a little bit and about a minute after my head started to feel heavy and I felt a little dizzy I went to sleep woke up and feel better
1361,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,40995,9,My first experience with Imitrex was taking it at workwell that was not a good idea I started to feel the migraine coming on so I took it at the first symptoms like I was told and went about my day Im a technician for an ophthalmologist and I started to get a hot flash I stood up and my arms and legs went totally numb Since Im on Topamax too I expect a little tingle but this was a RUSH All this aside about minutes later most of my heavy duty migraine symptoms were thwarted Not gone but a lot better I feel they would have been much better if I had been able to lie down rather than been on my feet working I also still had a pretty decent headache and photophobia the rest of the day
1366,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,40930,25,I hated my experience with Imitrex It made my chest feel strange heart beat increase and I felt very anxious while on it I guess it shortened the duration of my headache but I became very worried and preoccupied by its side effects
1367,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,40916,22,At first I thought it was great no headache Then the more frequently I used the medication to treat my migraines the more debilitating sideeffects I began to experience I could first mitigate the burningpain and weakness in my head neck and jaw and the general feeling of malaisefatigue by the administration of Naproxen or Ibuprofen prior to the Imitrex but then even that ceased to be effective I finally quit after experiencing total body weakness a more severe burningpain in my upper extremeties than ever before accompanied by fluctuating hotcold sensations everywhere else irregular heartbeat and irregular breathing after administration If you experiencing adverse sideeffects it gets worse Please find something else
1368,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40874,3,Imitrex has been a life saver for me I keep a few tablets with me at all times Imitrex relieves my headaches of the time It relives my migraines but it also works on all the other types of headaches too At least for me it does I usually only need one mg tablet but on a rare occasion I will have to take a second tablet to minutes after the first to get relief I dont know what Id do without this medicine I guess Im one of the lucky ones because I suffer no side effects at all when taking Imitrex
1369,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,40855,10,Imitrex took away my migraine but I could not function on it I had to lay down completely still and go to sleep because it made me so nauseous I felt like vomiting every time I moved I was extremely dizzy and it made my skin painful to the touch Even after the migraine went away I still felt out of it the rest of the day I would definitely ask for samples before paying for the prescription
1370,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40843,7,I have suffered from terrible migraines for the past years and saw no relief in sight Once I tried this needless injection it has changed my life for the better I was nervous to give myself the injection but I had my sister help me for moral support The injection did sting and bleed just a little but any migraine sufferer would not mind a little sting over the pain of a migraine I did get lightheadeddizzy for a few minutes however my migraine was gone within minutes Awesome medicine it gave me my life back I highly recommend it
1372,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40834,9,I was nervous about the pain and even though its needlefree I have a bit of a needle phobia and the idea of any injection even without a needle was pretty rough for me to get over After talking myself up for about minutes I was finally able to give myself the dose It hurt a lot more than I was expecting and bled more than my neurologist and pharmacist said it would so immediately after administering it I was pretty apprehensive I felt the side effects most people have reported weakness dizziness heaviness etc but I also had some nausea and I was really tired I felt nearimmediate relief of about of my migraine and then took a power nap for about minutes When I woke up I felt like a completely new person
1373,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40830,2,As a disabled veteran with chronic post traumatic stress disorder I have migraines or days a week for years now The VA refuses to treat my severe pain properly The VA will only give me NINE pills a month which is not enough The VA pharmacist told me it is because the medicine is too expensive None of the codeine medicines work After eight years with migraines sumatriptan is the only medicine that works for me What is wrong with the VA staff They do not care if I am in severe pain
1374,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40827,5,year migrainer Hands down this is the best overall migraine abortive I have used for over year and of the time it takes of the migraine away Biggest plus is no needle the sensation feels like a rubber band snap My other abortive is Treximet and Topamax mg daily for preventative
1375,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40807,12,I have been using Imitrex for over a year now It works very well for me I had some trouble with chest pain for awhile My Neurologist told me to try to tablet mg This has worked for me The headache goes away and all side effects are diminished I found that the side effects varied depending on the manufacturer There is something like a variance in dosage a mg tablet can contain as little as mg or as much as mg of Sumatriptan Also some coatings dissolve faster than others therefore more severe side effects if the Sumatriptan is absorbed too rapidly
1376,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40805,3,Pill form did not work for me but the statdose stops the pain within twenty mins most times Side effects are tightness in chest weakness in arms but this goes away within an hour or so Better than that little devil with the big hammer beating the inside of my head I take it as soon as I feel that I am getting a migraine and not just a common headache I try not to overuse it as I have a fear it will stop working and it is the only thing that works short of an ER visit for Demerol
1377,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40775,7,Imitrex has long been the quotgoldquot standard for quotmigraine sufferersquot quot cluster headache suffers a much rarer but more painful form of headachequot and even those who suffer from just occasional really painful headaches but not frequent enough to be characterized as the quotmigrainequot or quotclusterquot variety After speaking to your physician about the safety of you using Imitrex ask for Sumavel Dose from Zogenix Prefilled units that get the medication in your blood within minutes Amazing
1378,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40724,6,I have tried both the injection and tablet and its has worked wonders I have suffered with migraines since I was middle school now yrs old and this is the first medicine that has given me any relief The side effects only last for about minutes so its no problem The only issue I have is after about or hours the migraine seem to start up right Either way any relief is better than suffering through a migraine
1380,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40710,7,As long as I take it right when the migraine starts it completely stops the pain
1382,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40702,4,I love this medicine The only caveat The difficulty in filling the actual prescription I have all the side effects you have all mentioned but as everyone said well worth it Im a teacher and in my last two weeks of school I need the insurance issues to clear up so I can pick up the rest of my medicines
1383,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40695,1,This is a MIRACLE medicine for me and is most effective when taken at the onset of a migraine Within minutes I can feel the relief setting in Within an hour I have no sign of a headache or the usual symptoms of vomiting blurred vision ringing in the ears etc If I deny that I feel a migraine coming on and take the pill after the headache has progressed it takes a little longer for the pill to work Before this medicine I had become a prisoner in my own life not daring to venture far from home THANK YOU Imitrex for giving me back my life
1385,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40677,9,Best one for me in the some yrs Ive had to deal with them Ive taken mg pills all along
1386,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40676,6,Ive suffered from migraines since I was in the rd grade and I am now I take Topamax every night to try and control my headaches but when I get a really bad one I use the Sumavel HATE HATE HATE needles So this works for me very good There is pain with the injection but compared to the migraine its nothing A little bleeding at the site and always a bruise I can instantly feel the medicine working in my body and within minutes my migraine is gone Its my miracle
1387,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,40652,8,I have headaches everyday I get them in the morning and vomiting is first thing Imitrex injections clear them right up
1388,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,40605,11,Ive never felt so sick in my life My blood pressure shot up to the upper s and I felt like I was going to pass out
1389,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40604,6,Im years old and have used Imitrex for almost years No side effects except leg pain for about hours as if I overused in a workout Was on mg tabs for a long time with mg selfinjections as necessary Now just taking mg as I get fewer and less intense headaches now This medicine is worth trying but ask for EKG first if the doctor doesnt order it this can help check for heart okay first
1390,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,40559,10,I just use the Sumavel it stings in application area for minutes but my headache was gone in about minutes I felt little dizzy after wards Highly recommended and well worth it
1391,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40543,11,I am and suffered with migraines since about age didnt get Imitrex until my early s It has saved my life without it I was worthless for a day Fortunately I can cut mg into and it works for me I would lay down for minutes and headache gone Recently I have had to use the generic and didnt think anything of it and have found I need to take a mg and now I get side effects I didnt before Just the weird feelings from vasodilatation in my chest and sometimes my legs Sometimes the mg doesnt take it completely away I am a nurse and will look for another alternative because I would have to pay for boxes out of pocket if I want the brand
1392,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,40186,6,Ive tried a lot of migraine drugs and this one didnt help me
1393,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40184,7,Imitrex pills worked for me for a few years but then it stopped being as effective and I had to take Then that stopped working so I tried Imitrex statdose the injections and they work wonders They hurt a lot but the pain in my leg after I give it to myself is far less horrible than the migraine pain I give myself the shot and lie down for about minutes and Im fine Maybe a little pain but I feel much better Im also on Timolol Neurontin and Cymbalta and my migraines have reduced in number and then this helps when I get them And the shot works after youve had the migraine for a while you dont have to take it at the first sign to get relief
1394,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,40183,16,Imitrex makes me more nauseous than I am with just the headache My neck and shoulders get very stiff and it takes more than an hour to feel any relief As others have said however if I am able to take this medicine and lie down it does wonders Life just isnt that practical though so I cant use it anymore
1397,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40148,1,It works every time I use it but I feel that my migraines are much more frequent since taking first Imitrex and then the generic
1399,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40136,11,My doctor gave me a sample of Imitrex when it first came out It was a MIRACLE drug for me Up to that time nothing I took helped the headaches I got Ive used it since Over time my headaches have gotten less maybe with age But I keep it with me all the time just in case I quotdont leave home without itquot
1400,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,40127,5,Thank God for Imitrex The first tablet I took stopped the headache and didnt have any side effects the first time The next time I took it I felt shaky The only side effect that I get from Imitrex is jaw pain But at least my migraines are no longer in my back Just make sure that if you are needing two mg tablets a day for several days in a row and you still arent getting relief Consider a preventive or have a backup I dont have nearly as many headaches anymore
1401,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40119,5,Sumatripan Injections probably saved my life The only thing that works on my cluster headaches The injections are expensive but my doctor backed me up in my battle with my insurance company Works in minutes or less major side effect that I have found is burning but Ill take that rather than the headache
1403,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40101,27,Something that really works for me when my schedule allows is to take a short nap after taking Imitrex I wake up with little discomfort My head is clear I can think One of the worst symptoms of my migraines is that I cannot stay focused on a task If I am unable to nap the Imitrex has little effect on me This is horrible when you are at work as many of you know
1405,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40092,0,Amazing drug usually cures my migraines within minutes after taking
1407,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40077,4,If you can stand the burning sensation then its all worth it Its the only thing that helps my migraines I used to get them for days on end and I dont get them so often anymore I also add a trip to the chiropractor as well
1408,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,40062,14,Did not work for chronic cluster headache at all
1409,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40030,4,I have had migraines since I was years old they are very strong in my family I have been using the Imitrex injections since I was I am now I am always amazed at how well the Imitrex works because I get migraines so often I usually wait until my migraine is pretty bad before taking an injection You are supposed to take it at the first sign of a migraine but if I did that I would take an injection almost daily I take the injection lie down for minuted and the migraine is totally gone Seriously The only side effects I have are a tinglytight feeling that lasts minutes and as of the last years a red itchy injection site reaction that resolves in hours or less
1410,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,40015,17,Imitrex would eventually stop the headache but like others have stated my heart feels like its about to jump out of my chest and I would get a worse headache before it got better
1411,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,39982,9,Injection is the best
1412,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,39976,16,Im a migraines per week person When I first tried Imitrex I thought I had found my own personal miracle Even on days that I didnt have a full blown migraine I would still have pain and this was the first time I felt completely pain free in years Unfortunately the honeymoon wore off after about months I used Imitrex quite frequently during that time and had wonderful results even though sometimes I had to take two pills to really do the job But after eight months pills werent doing the job my headache was still lingering
1413,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,39971,11,I have suffered migraines for years This is the only medication that works for me If I run out of it it will be a trip to the ER and hours of vomiting and stacks of paperwork and minutes of ER doctor interrogations for sureI have Imitrex in my purse
1414,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39970,3,I have been a sufferer from what was thought to be very bad headache attacks but as I later began to doubt this I was told by my GP that my headaches could actually be migraine attacks I was given sumatriptan tablets to see if this would help in combating the onset of my headaches and stop them all together and not just preventing a headache from developing into a migraine I used to suffer from full blown migraines from time to time once or twice a month and less severe attacks in between Now as soon as I begin to feel any kind of eye or neck strain or light sensitivity I know am going to be okay Ask your GP about Sumatriptan medication Highly recommended
1415,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39969,4,Because my migraines start while I am asleep I do not get the quotlightsquot prior to onset I start by having ringing in my ears around pm then around am the pain starts If I take a shot at that time I can function during the day If not around to am I awake with a fullblown blindinoneeye migraine and I cannot function for about hours Later it feels like someone took a baseball bat to my head and it hurts
1416,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39968,8,Works great for me Can take or tablet most of time Have only taken whole tab on rare occasions Migraine is usually triggered by irregular or lack of sleep or tension this medicine makes me sleepy Most times Im functional within minutes no side effects
1418,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,39948,12,Only thing that works for clusters Within miniutes pain is gone Thank Goodness for this medicine Only wish you could take more than doses in a hour peroid
1419,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39911,9,Imitrex nasal sprays changed my life I developed migraines when I was about years old At that time the doctor would simply prescribe pain killers for treatment but they did nothing They only helped me sleep for a few hours and then I would wake back up to the headache again After seeing a neurologist I was prescribed Imitrex I have tried all three forms of the medication the pills did not work as well for me because I always vomit with a migraine I simply did not get enough doses with the injections to last a month only two in a prescription But with the nasal sprays I receive each month and they work GREAT
1421,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,39890,22,Imitrex does the trick of getting rid of my migraine every time but the side effects are a little rough I feel as though my neck and chest are tightening and achy but if I go to sleep about minutes after taking Imitrex I miss the side effects happening to me and just wake up feeling better
1422,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39885,23,God bless Imitrex I can take the injection either at the start of a migraine or right in the middle of it and it works like a charm each time I dont know what I would do without it My migraines were crippling but thanks to Imitrex I have my life back
1423,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,39854,2,Imitrex injections have worked like a miracle Have used it since they first came out Have had two minor heart problems in the past years The most recent one last week Was informed I cant take Imitrex anymore Dont know what Ill do Im a year old male and have had migraines for years Only the last years have been controlled
1424,Sumatriptan,Not Listed / Othe,10,39822,1,Works really GOOD and FAST
1425,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39770,5,Great drug
1426,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,39765,9,I find Imitrex to be very effective against my migraines as long as I take it at the start of one The first and second time I took Imitrex I experienced stomach cramps The next time I had to take it I had eaten shortly before and this greatly reduced the cramping If Im nauseous I obviously wont be able to eat a full meal but the cramps do seem to be decreasing each time I take it anyway The only other side effects I have are a burning sensation in my nose and a sore throat which are both tolerable Imitrex is very expensive but definitely worth it to me I can take a tablet lay down for an hour or two and then get back up to live life again
1427,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39764,15,I switched from mg to the shots which are mg I found that if I lay down for minutes after a shot I get up and feel as if I never had the headache
1428,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,39735,5,I have used this drug for several years now and have had good success with it I am on the mg and for the most part this will do the trick if I catch it in time
1430,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39695,9,I love this medicine Before I would always worry about the next time I was going to get a headache I couldnt work or play with my son I hated it But now if I get one I can just take my imitrex and minutes later its gone like I never had a headache at all The only thing I dont like is it is pricey but I will pay because it works very well Now that I have tried it I couldnt live without it
1431,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,39658,4,This drug is the only thing apart from being knocked outthat works Yes the injections are expensive but what a life saver never leave home without them
1432,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,39627,12,Imitrex worked for me only when I could take the medicine at the onset of a migraine If I had a full blown migraine it didnt help
1434,Sumatriptan,Not Listed / Othe,8,39600,2,The tablets eased migraine in about mins I feel a bit spaced out but compared to the migraine its nothing
1435,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,39567,4,Imitrex injection has worked well for me for the past several years but sometimes it doesnt last more than hours and I need a second injection Pills dont work as well nasal spray doesnt work at all for me The only side effects I have are flushing with sweating and some drowsiness Im just glad to have it as I get a few migraines a month I definitely recommend it
1436,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,39567,16,the first few years i was prescribed imitrex i thought it was a miracle drug now after ten years i find that i need to add excedrine migraine with it and i still have residual pain stillit sure beats a full blown migraine
1439,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,39538,16,These injections are a God send for Clusterers The ONLY drawback that I experienced was the expense which forbids me from using them on a regular basisbut the tablets are a good substitute just takes much longer to work The injections work almost instantly
1441,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39522,4,Injection WORKS in minutes and you can have your life back Only thing I dont like is the minutes Hot flashes that can soak your clothing amp make your pain a times more intense Just wait it out No more pain no more loud noises amp no more bright lights I do not like the pill takes too long
1442,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,40543,2,I have used Zomig mg for years and often one half of a tablet zaps the headache within minutes without any side effects at all Since becoming eligible for Medicare my prescription plan has forced me to use the generic sumatriptan Sumatriptan does not work at all for me I wish I could afford to take my Zomig again it is a wonder drug
1443,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40540,4,I use Imitrex at the start of my aura which is usually minutes long and once the aura is gone the headache hits me I add a Vicodin pill with the Imitrex and usually lay down when and where I can It seems to work for me The only side effects I have are a stiff neck and upper back and grogginess for a day or two I keep Imitrex in my car at work the boat and my golf bag
1444,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40539,10,The magic migraine medicine Im years old and have suffered from moderately severe migraines since I was The list of different drugs Ive taken over the years is too long to recite and the only other drug that has been effective in any way is FioricetFiorinal but I develop a tolerance to Fiorinal I was skeptical when I first tried Imitrex but have become a believer I have taken both nasal spray and tablets and both work quickly and thoroughly with NO SIDE EFFECTS Truly the magic miracle migraine medicine for which I am sincerely grateful
1445,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40537,13,I have high regard for Imitrex And the generic first provided by Dr Reddy was equal to the original Imitrex However I have recently been required to use a different generic and it is basically worthless I was taking milligrams and having the migraine gone within an hour Now a milligram tablet has little effect and I usually have to take a second milligram tablet to get any relieve I would sure like to know how the generic industry works because for me it does not seem to be quite up to speed at least with the drug that I need most
1446,Sumatriptan,Migraine,4,40480,5,While it did make the pain stop it didnt help the other symptoms I have It also left a dull aching pressure in my face made my chest hurt and my hair felt as though it was being pulled I found out later it is not supposed to be used by people whove had atypical migraines which Ive had
1447,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,7,40479,15,I take sumatriptan for the onset of my migraines and nausea that come along with my CVS On bad days they help a lot The only thing is I usually have to take more than one dose and the medication is expensive even with insurance
1449,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,40412,13,This medicine works fast and it is the best I have had so far for acute cluster headache Highly recommended
1450,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40409,15,Doctor gave me a sample and a prescription of this to try I have used Treximet with great results but it took too long for the medicine to into my system to counter the migraine The Sumavel works GREAT HOWEVER it does hurt The initial injection is painful I was left with a welt and a tender spot for hours afterwards The injection pain is well worth the relief I do get the burning sensation at the bottom of my brain stem seconds after the injection and feel very weak This is all normal as I got the same feeling when I start Treximet Luckily my insurance company covers it
1452,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,40382,8,Fast relief after injecting Havent had many other treatments I use for cluster headaches
1454,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40360,4,I have used both the pill and the injection form of Imitrex and they are both amazing The first time I was given a shot was in the walkin clinic the first time I had a migraine After a very weird initial sensation of kind of a quotbuzzquot I could actually feel the headache dissipating The pill form works just as well but like some other reviewers stated it does work best if you can lay down for a while
1455,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40345,5,I had migraines years ago and they were debilitating I had to be alone in a dark room I had trouble remembering my own name It was as if I had had a stoke Eventually I seem to have outgrown themI suspect some people label bad headaches quotmigrainesquot when they arent My wife has CFS and has serious real migraines about once a week Imitrex is nothing short of a miracle medication for her Nothing else helps The main negative is the cost about for a box of about six nasal sprayers She will use four to defeat one headache Insurance only pays for two boxes a month and she needs at least three With copays we end up spending about a month on Imitrex
1456,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40344,23,Had migraines since I was Thirty years later and they are worse Have tried Maxalt Treximet butalbital Excedrin migraine and Zomig to name the ones I remember Tried a sample of Sumavel DosePro this month It is the only medication that stopped the pain Took minutes to stop a bad migraine on a scale and another minutes to be back to functional Was a bit disoriented and dizzy for that first minutes Relpax is my typical drug of choice nowadays but it doesnt stop the bad ones It only stops the ones that I catch right away But this Sumavel is my new knight in shining armor I dont know how expensive it is yet but Im headed back to the doctor this week to find out
1457,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40330,11,I have had migraines since I was but theyve been getting worse and worse and I decided it was time to go to a doctor I went in and they gave me Sumavel DosePro to see if the medicine was effective The initial quotinjectionquot was awful It hurt as bad as my migraines did only in my thigh Then I felt extremely dizzy and my whole body was sore and I had trouble breathing They let me rest for about minutes before sending me home with a sample of Treximet I got home and took a nap for about minutes When I woke up I felt better than I had in months Finally my head felt clear and I had energy back As much as the initial pain and discomfort was it only lasted about an hour in comparison to the day migraines I was getting before
1458,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40304,5,This medicine works great for my migraine headaches I experience drowsiness and a heaviness or tightness in my head and neck but on minimally My headaches are usually gone within an hour or two Sometimes the drowsiness is nice because it helps me sleep through the pain I would definitely recommend this product
1461,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40282,9,Im years old and have experienced migraines since age Imitrex is the best drug Ive used I take mg at the first sign and it prevents it of the time If taken after the headache starts it stops the pain within hour and much faster if I lay down Yes there are mild side effectsdrowsiness sensitivite to hot and cold but it sure is better than a headache
1462,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40281,13,Injections are expensivebut they are the only thing that I have found that work for my cluster headaches Truly a lifesaver The burning sensation is ugly but better than the viciousness ripping of my head to pieces

1468,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,39509,31,Horrible Made my chest tighten up and did nothing for my migrane I ended up in the ER
1469,Ibudone,Pain,7,41286,27,I just started taking this medicine I have been taking Hydrocodone with acetaminophen for pain since but recently discovered that there exists a variation with a medicine that would address inflammation in addition for pain and wondered why for all these years no one suggested I take that variant I specifically asked for it because I have inflammation I take it because I have debilitating pain in my lumbarsacral spine in my left parietal brain and I have IC I also have triple major scoliosis and major depression
1470,Triple Antibiotic,Bacterial Skin Infection,10,42855,0,AAA ointment it like gives you wolverine speed healing I work in the food service industry red lobster yay and I get a lot of cuts when I work dish but all I need is to put a on little Neosporin covered with a bandaid overnight and the next day its like nearly healed I ruined up my hand because my roommates dog chews up everything and she chewed the handle of the garden trowel and it gave me a massive blister that immediately broke open and got ripped off so after the naked angry red lower layer of skin dried out a little bit I covered it with a thin layer of AAA and put a bandaid over it for two nights and now its almost healed I tell everyone all you need is neosporin and a bandaid and it works
1472,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,1,43029,3,Absolute trash This medication DID NOT relieve my pain Just another rubbish medication to make drug companies wealthy
1473,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,5,42960,7,It works ok for my mild back pain It is not very effective for my severe back pain and broken rib
1474,Ultram ODT,Back Pain,7,42767,85,I have been on tramadol for many years for fibromyalgia back pain I take six mg a day It does in fact help It makes it bearable most of the time However when its at its worst the medicine doesnt faze it I would recommend a second prescription of something much stronger for occasional pain maybe a month if that Doctors and lawmakers need to realize that people with pain that will never get better and will progressively get worse need relief Unfortunately that is going to involve addictive medication But their addiction isnt the high Its the addiction to function and to live a productive life We crave these medications because we know without them our quality of life is very low
1475,Ultram ODT,Pain,10,42724,28,You can use ultram to detox yourself from harder stuff like OXY or H I used it before for withdrawal symptoms and it worked great In case ur ever withdrawing bad and have some it will help
1476,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,5,42467,27,I use ultramTramadol mg for breakthrough pain usually Normally in that capacity they work okay Prefer them to having to use a second opioid that makes me drowsy or more constipated Right now it has become my only pain med and taking max dose of hrs is a joke If you have real pain long term I find a common opinion among chronic pain sufferers that this is true
1477,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,10,42407,59,I have to say this med has helped me a lot it has taken my pain from to I drive a semi so Im very limited on what I can take Also sitting in that seat for hours on end would make me want to hang it up The pain was so bad then I was put on tramadol now I can play with my kids right after driving for hours and just be a little stiff n sore instead of going straight to bed cause of the pain Plus cigarettes tasted so nasty I had no problem quitting when I started
1478,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,8,41813,68,I have been taking Ultramtramadol for fifteen years fourday It is usually but not always effective I often have to add the NSAID Naprosyn I have neuropathy and other side effects from chemo and osteoarthritis also from chemo Many joints have no cartilage I am concerned about chemical dependency and consciously avoided codeine or morphine The Tramadol gets me through the average pain but not the severe pain I really wish someone would come up with an analgesic that was both effective and nonaddictive and did not diminish alertness and effectiveness
1481,Ultram ODT,Pain,10,40875,105,I have been using tramadol for eight years for joint and muscle pain the result of Lyme Disease which was undetected for more than a year I have NO adverse effects The one major problem I have had is since the medicine has now been classified a narcotic my doctor now hesitates to prescribe it even though I have taken the same dosage for eight years with no reduction of effectiveness or need to increase dosage
1483,Daliresp,COPD,7,41311,51,I have been using Daliresp for week now It appears to have improved my breathing but I have several of the sideeffects Now Im having problems with diarrhea anxiety and trouble sleeping Ive got a call into my doctor now to see if the sideeffects will go away If they dont Ill have to go back to Advair
1484,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,9,41286,45,Been on Daliresp for weeks now and I feel great no side effects I feel so good I forget to take my inhaler twice a day Thank you for this amazing medication
1485,Daliresp,COPD,5,41125,66,Originally I had no side effects on Daliresp and noticed better breathing but after two months I noticed a moderate tremor PCP put me on primidone for benign essential tremor After another month the tremor increased significantly and I asked my pharmacist what drugs could be causing this After she told me Daliresp I went online to the manufacturers website and discovered that primidone should NOT be used with Daliresp Since it is the weekend and my tremors are continuing to increase to the prevention of some normal activities Ive stopped using both until I can talk to doctors on Monday
1487,Daliresp,COPD,9,41108,69,Been on Daliresp for months No weight loss or stomach issues Has greatly improved shortness of breath and no bronchitis flare ups Before Daliresp you could count on at least to flare ups per year
1488,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,3,41089,43,Same as previous comment Made me sick to my stomach serious diahrea Only took for days and felt terrible like I had the flu It did help the breathing but not enough to put up with the side effects
1489,Daliresp,COPD,10,40979,54,My husband learned about Daliresp mcg after being in ICU for a monthBreathing has improved a great deal
1490,Daliresp,COPD,10,40958,79,Wow this pill has helped my father big time He has been on it since August of and no exacerbation since then My father had of them last winter but thanks to this product none since hes been taking it His doctor also said that it would take a while to kick in however so far so good and he claims that he can breath better
1491,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,3,40925,47,Dalliresp did open me up but the side effects were bad so I had to stop it Diarrhea nausea so bad I had to take medicine for it
1493,Daliresp,COPD,1,40860,77,Got prescribed this as Im allergic to prednisone On it for weeks but only taking of the pill daily with food as it was making me quite nauseated and continues but not as bad A little apprehensive about taking a new medicine FDA approval
1494,Daliresp,COPD,9,40849,87,Have been on Daliresp for one month now no problems and seems to help Can feel a difference in my shortness of breath So far so good
1495,Daliresp,COPD,10,40836,79,No side effects at all
1496,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,43061,1,Ive been taking this medication for over a month I couldnt take it twice a day as that made my stomach hurt badly I take pill a day and works like a miracle I used to look for bathrooms everywhere i went It was embarrassing Almost had accidents several times because the diahrrea was so badThe only bad thing I can really say is that IF I miss a dose or take it late my diahrrea comes back immediately with a vengeance So just remember to be vigilant in your schedule Otherwise best medicine ever
1499,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,43032,4,Nobody has mentioned this but this medication makes me have to pee more often
1500,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,43024,6,My miracle drug Been taking for about a year now I finally have a life
1501,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,43015,5,Ive been dealing with IBS several years to the point where it has taken over my life virtually homebound Started trying the FODMAP diet which my doctor hasnt even heard of and was gaining some control over my IBS Then he gave me some samples of both Viberzi and Creon The first day I tried both meds I was a constipated drugged crying my eyes out basket case It stopped my bowel movements all together No BM the first day stomach felt bloated and tight and I was in a stupor The Creon SEVERELY exacerbated my depression Second day I took a pill of Viberzi only and had a really sedated feeling and slept the day away Not as much belly pain Thinking about taking at bedtime
1504,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7,43002,5,This medication has managed my diarrhea attacks very well but the stomach discomfort that I experience when taking it is starting to make me consider discontinuing it Hoping some of you have suggestions
1505,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42995,13,Ive lived with IBS for as long as I can remember I worked in a high stress career since the s In the s I went to my doctor to get help His advice avoid foods that upset your stomach The trouble was that everything did this I could not sit through a meal at a restaurant without stopping part way through to run to the bathroomI moved to East Tennessee I established myself with a new doctor As part of his initial review of my health the IBS came into discussion He recommended a new drug Viberzi To say it has been lifechanging is an understatement I cannot tell you how great it is to be able to eat and not have IBS immediately One more thing my gallbladder was removed in no problems or side effects for me
1506,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42990,8,This drug has done wonders for my IBSD Ive suffered for years and was skeptical this would help I was at my wits end and was withdrawing from everyone Now I go on my way and do not have to find the bathroom everywhere I go just in case Everyone should give it a try as it may work for you despite negative reviews Every body is different so its worth trying it for yourself Best of luck
1507,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42985,5,After one week I went from having diarrhea times a day to normal movements twice average a day What a Godsend
1508,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42972,4,Finally some relief This is a hands down miracle drug for IBS Not a cure but Id say it controls my symptoms of the time which is outstanding
1510,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42969,5,mg x daily Diarrhea to the point of incontinence Told by doctor to take immodium minutes before eating anything Ended up being bloated and still have explosive diarrhea I stopped taking Viberzi and my untreated IBS D symptoms are a heck of a lot better than on the medication dont get me wrong I still have urgent needs but at least I can go back to the gym
1511,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42967,6,I took Viberzi for about a week and then I had acute pancreatitis for three weeks I have my gallbladder I dont drink and aside for IBSD I dont really have health issues This is a dangerous drug
1512,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42944,2,I have been using this with good results for almost a year I did have some break through diahrrea on occasion What I would like to know is has anyone stopped taking it after taking for a while I had been using the dollar coupon but now the price has gone up and the coupon is not valid So I am waiting for insurance approval But my doctor gave me samples and I have ran out I have called my doctor three times today to get more samples as they said they would give them to me until insurance comes throught but they never got back to me So I will just not have them to take Has anyone had experience with just stopping and if so what were the effects Thank you for any help Guess Ill stock up on imodium until I hear from them
1513,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42940,6,Horrible pain Was hospitalized Terrible drug
1518,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42890,9,Went my doctor in tears diarrhea was so bad it was up to or more times a day Stomach pain everything I ate made me sick My doctor gave me the FODMAP diet to follow and to go gluten free he also prescribed Viberzi I took the first tablet that evening mg twice a day In less than hours my diarrhea had stopped and the pain was gone I feel strictly following the FODMAP diet along with Viberzi did the trick Been taking Viberzi for a month and a half I had one bout of severe diarrhea when I ate a biscuit and boy did I feel the pain It took hours for it to stop Im one of those people who just cant eat gluten
1519,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42890,21,I have been taking VIBERZI for a little over days and it has all but eliminated my issues with chronic diarrhea that have had for forty years The first week I had some stomach bloating but that quickly subsided I can actually go places and not constantly trying to figure out where the closest restroom is It is literally changing my life
1520,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42888,4,Have Short Bowel with IBD over years Tried this medication and felt like a hat was crushing my head the first day than followed by increasing worse headache bordering on migraines Pain in my stomach was only surpassed by the pain in my back just under the ribcage probably liver location Nauseated constantly too Hate this ridiculously expensive medication
1521,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42881,12,Worked the second day I took it and I have been on it since Had IBSD for months and was having trouble getting ANY kind of food to work with me I can actually eat now and not have to make a run for the restroom the minute I swallow the first or second bite Thanks to all the medchemists clinicians volunteers toxicologists and people who worked on it and made this drug a reality
1522,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42871,14,I struggled with severe IBSD for years Viberzi began working on day of taking itIt has changed my life I am able to function and participate in activities outside of my home I was having water diarrhea times DAILY I have been on Viberzi for days and I have only experienced bouts of diarrhea
1523,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42866,10,Im baffled by reports of this not working I tried Xifaxin and was flushed out for days worse than before then on first day of taking Viberzi it stopped yrs IBSD tried everything amp only Lotroxex worked prior to Blk Box It worked with FIRST pill for me I might suggest doing as I did which was starting on mg x day then on nd week to mg day I also did extensive research and while I can eat whatever I want One MUST not drink and if you do maybe beer or wine once or twice a week due to liver enzyme and prostrate side effect possibility so NOT for heavy drinkers That said I have been on months now and have had JUST TWO upset stomachs THIS IS NORMAL amp glad that Rx allows bad food or virus to come thru VIBERZI
1524,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42860,15,Why would one take a medication for abdominal pain when one of the side effects is abdominal pain
1525,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42857,13,I had to take Imodium daily in order to fend off diarrhea and the constant bathroom breaks It has impacted every aspect of my life I was afraid to eat when a bathroom wasnt readily available As I grew older the condition became worse I would eat and have to go immediately A normal day out with the wife and kids stopping for lunch would create a great deal of anxiety Should I eat can I eat and would I make it to a bathroom on time My working career took into account how accessible bathroom facilities were Vibrenzi worked to end diarrhea and has limited my bathroom calls However I get extremely tired minutes after taking the dosage and remain so all day Dry mouth and gas are also a problem Price cost is a pill
1526,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42843,14,Actually it slows it down But after a year on it I was in the ER times with pain in upper GI tract I guess my liver didnt like it and I got drug induced hepatitis Quit taking it slowed down on sodium intake Processed foods Watch diet Thats it
1527,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42836,18,Ive been having success for years controlling my symptoms with probiotics and a sugarfree spicefree diet but thought maybe with Viberzi I could eventually get back to eating anything I want again You know be quotnormalquot Wrong After just a few days of taking it I had pain like I have never felt before in my life shooting up my back and stomach to the point that I was vomiting nonstop and shooting pangs of diarrhea Isnt that what this drug is supposed to cure It was like the worst case of food poisoning but with indescribable pain I remember saying quotIll take IBSd over this any dayquot I am back on my probiotics and my sugar free diet and finally recovered again Im glad that it works for some people but not for me Yikes
1528,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42835,12,Worked for maybe a week then stopped working Stopped for a couple weeks and tried again does nothing at all back to Immodium that has been working some for years
1529,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42824,19,Ive had IBS D for as long as I can remember Viberzi has fixed that Im living a normal life I can now go out and just enjoy the day without having to worry about my stomach So thankful
1530,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42822,16,I have had IBSD for nearly years and getting worse as time goes on Flare ups after everything I ate Traveling anywhere is horrible and I could never eat the day before flying until I landed then would eat My Dr prescribed this medicine and I have been taking it weeks So far so good with only diarrhea episodes That is really good for me I hope it changes my life and everyone suffering from this frustrating condition Im sorry to the ones it didnt help I hope you can find some relief soon
1531,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42820,16,Started this five months ago and in the first week I was totally fine It stopped all symptoms Felt great Ate what I wanted After being diagnosed over years ago and managed well with diet most of the past years A year ago I was back to trips to the bathroom with immediate diarrhea daily at least days per week Viberzi was amazing Went to pharmacy this week to pick up refill Had Note to call doctor Had to take me off immediately Has been black listed for patients without gall bladder Doc wanted me on on lotronex Has also been black listed for tissue death in intestines I stopped medication on Thursday and I have had immediate resumption of diarrhea Cant leave the house Have to travel to a conference for work all week
1532,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42819,19,For the last years I have had issues with IBSD Id say I would have a quotnormalquot bowel movement of the time with about occurrences of rushing to the bathroom per day and the rest of the time just unpleasant bowel movements My Gastro prescribed mg Viberzi and it worked almost immediately Id say in the first week I had two occurrences of diarrhea and the rest of the time I was quotnormalquot After a month I have had diarrhea a total of times and had some of my best bowel movements in the last years Ive even eaten Taco Bell several times and not had to go It is truly freeing to not feel nervous about whether I would make it home in time after eating dinner
1534,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42800,23,Was constipated most of the weeks I was on it One night all of the sudden I had horrible cramping under my rib cage and a pain that went all the way up my spine The pain was so horrendous I was crawling on the floor crying in pain screaming in a pillow as to not wake my children I would scream at times and nothing would come out I had tears and mucous coming down my face I literally thought I was in hell I have NEVER experienced pain like this in my life I have birthed children and lived with Ulcerative ColitisIBD for years I know what pain is I wound up going to the ER and reporting this to my GI doctor So much for this quotmiracle pillquot I was so hoping this was going to work
1535,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42800,14,For me this medication did absolutely nothing went back to my usual daily Imodium after one miserable week of quotgoingquot almost nonstopBUT even though is was useless for me I say try it out we are all different Best wishes to us all
1536,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42794,23,I use this medication after long years with IBS D I already used it months and for me working great my life go back to normal
1537,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,4,42792,7,At the time I think Viberzi worked for my IBS but it made me nauseous and didnt feel well After the first two weeks it put me in the bed because I was so fatigued Now I have a prescription that cost over that I cant use because I cant handle Viberzi After the Viberzi I was craving sugar and so I got some hard candies My IBS got better and I thought it might be because it created a lot of saliva which helped with digestion Therefore I got some digestive enzymes with Amylase which is the enzyme in saliva and now I am eating all sorts of foods with absolutely no problems except maybe some burping
1538,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42788,14,months with viberzi and I am really happy I just feel bad sometimes when I eat too much junk food but is nothing compared to before For me is very helpful no side effects at all just the first days
1539,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42787,27,I have been taking mg bid for over a year now I have never been so normal feeling in my gut I do have some bad days with it just depends on what I eat I get stuck gas sometimes and have to really push and typically take a phazyme to relieve it I dont get any adverse reactions Its a pain in the butt at the pharmacy but well worth it I have had crohns for years now had major bowel resection surgeries and lost my ileum Every BM was watery and explosive and very very painful After a few weeks of taking it I was happy but did not think it would work for long And this has seriously put me in remission and I have average BMs a day that are semisolid versus my old average at or more per day Changed my life
1540,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42786,8,Has already turned my life completely around

1543,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42775,20,I have suffered from IBSD for years I used to be able to manage it by not eating triggers and occasional Imodium The last six months it had gotten so much worse I couldnt eat without running to bathroom within minutes Going out to eat was horrible I barely could make it home It started causing major anxiety because a few times a almost didnt make it The spasms would last all day I could hardly eat anything I would have to take to Imodium if I was going to go out to keep the diarrhea away I was living on it After normal testing the doctor put me on Viberzi It has been a miracle drug It has given me my life back
1545,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42771,22,This medicine has literally given me my life back It stops the diarrhea and I do not have the constant urge to have to use the bathroom anymore I recommend it to anyone suffering from ibs d
1546,Daliresp,COPD,7,42947,3,Daliresp did cause me nausea and diarrhea but Doctor prescribed Zofran for the nausea and Zofran causes constipation Problem solved
1548,Daliresp,COPD,10,42786,24,I have severe COPD I cannot walk around I was coughing up lungers daily but for last years with this I have had maybe or times Life saver
1549,Daliresp,COPD,4,42751,9,Breathing great diarrhea not so great Not worth it
1550,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,6,42668,15,I just started taking Daliresp again the only problem that I have is I cant sleepI cant go to sleep or stay asleepand when I do go to sleep its only for a few hrsthan I am awake againI take it before and stop taking it because I could sleepI really dont know at this time if it works or nothavent been on it long enough to knowthats one of the side effectsso what can u do to stay asleep
1553,Daliresp,COPD,10,42618,27,This drug has worked wonders for me Its too bad we cant afford it
1554,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,2,42603,19,Started taking Dailresp mths ago Noticed improvement in breathing in st week Then started having nausea and loss of appetite I also started having other reactionsinsomnia depression anxiety panic attacks bad thoughts about death Over the last mths its gotten worse I didnt know it could be the Dailresp This morning I woke up at am couldnt go back to sleep because of thoughts of dying Its pm Im still awakeI cant sleep during the day Got so bad I went to the ER today The Doctor told me to stop the Dailresp OK I never had mental health issues before I dont have any clue how long it will take to recover from the mental health issues Im having
1555,Daliresp,COPD,8,42568,37,I have been on this medication for approximately one month When I first began taking this medication mcg and was having numerous side effects Changed regimen to taking mcg every other day Continued to have same side effects For past two weeks I have been taking onehalf dosage mcg once at night and once in the morning This has virtually eliminated all the previous side effects My breathing improvement has been much better and more consistent with this low dosage The mcg pills are so small that is is impossible to divide a tablet without a good pill cutter I found one on Amazon that works great Perfect split of mcg pill each time
1557,Daliresp,COPD,3,42456,31,Have been on Dalisrep over weeks now could tell much improvement in my breathing Didnt need to use supplemental oxygen at all However yesterday I couldnt take the nausea vomiting tremors leg aches headaches bathroom trips any longer I tried taking the meds with and without food didnt seem to make any difference Im wondering how long the side effects last It seems some people dont have side effects at all I am so disappointed that I wont be able to continue this drug as I feel that it was helping me with my breathing But I cant stand the side effects any longer I have lost lbs in the weeks I have no appetite whatsoever and I know that I need the nutrition as prednisone causes bone loss
1559,Daliresp,COPD,10,42162,51,I used to have exacerbations regularly after finishing a dose of prednisone Began taking Daliresp a year and a half ago and have not had one since The only side effects I had was a weeks worth of very loose bowel movements when I first began A great medicine
1560,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,10,41887,23,I seem to have lost my tasting abilities for foods
1561,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,2,41853,32,Love what this does to improve my breathing but the diarrhea just wont go away and that is the worst side effect for me I tried taking in the morning and got headaches and felt nauseous as well as having the diarrhea so took it at night but the diarrhea has persisted If I cant take something to counter this side effect I will stop taking as I cant go anywhere with the diarrhea
1562,Daliresp,COPD,8,41837,49,Made huge difference in breathing and lessened exacerbations
1564,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,10,41689,57,Been on Daliresp since September no adverse side effects at all I find that it has helped my breathing greatly Have not had and exacerbation since going on medication Prior to Daliresp had to flare ups yearly
1565,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,9,41572,52,My wife has been taking this medicine for weeks for COPD maintenance It worked great for the COPD she use to cough constantly and had a hard time breathing even while on prednisone However within hours of taking the Daliresp she stopped coughing amp began breathing well However she developed diarea then after coming off the prednisone got severe back pain and was not able to sleep It seems to help the COPD very well but the side effects may not be worth the breathing relief
1566,Daliresp,COPD,10,41563,78,Medicine took water weight of lb immediately and another lb in the next weeks Helped my breathing almost immediately Was nauseous for months however I took med at night to sleep through nausea Have used for yrs and no more side effects Does help keep swelling to a minimum in entire body
1567,Daliresp,COPD,10,41547,76,I started with a sample from my doctor After using daliresp I didnt notice any change in my breathingafter only days I realized I didnt use my nebulizer as much I cant believe this little pill could help so muchBravo Only problem I wont be able to get another prescription due to the high co pay what a shame I do recommend this medication highly
1568,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,2,41529,36,Did improve wheezing symptoms when taken in conjunction with Advair Diskus however caused sleep problems as well as digestive disturbances bowel motionsday
1569,Daliresp,COPD,10,41471,72,Prior to taking Daliresp had to take inhalers everyday always before exercising occasionally just to breathe normally frequent lung infections per year Felt like I had a lung infection once again when the doctor prescribed this med instead of the typical antibiotics and prednisoneAfter taking Daliresp felt much better in a few days no longer need to take inhalers only x in last days and exercising jogging and weights almost everyday Big improvementOnly downside occasional headaches maybe times per week that go away after a couple advilsOverall big improvement in quality of life
1570,Daliresp,COPD,10,41389,54,I started it days ago I felt better on the nd day
1571,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42666,22,I can not tell you how wonderful this medicine has been for me I have suffered from IBS for probably years now I am able to have a normal life free of spastic bowel movements every time I would eat never able to sit thru a movie NOW I AM FREE
1572,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42666,21,Started viberzi mg x daily for IBSD since I dont have a gallbladder Was great for first days and then diarrhea kicked in x daily Early this morning had severe abdominal pain with sweating and weakness Pain was so bad I thought I was having a heart attack and almost called Made myself vomit and felt better after that MD said if it happens again I will have to come off the Viberzi
1574,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42661,19,From day of taking Viberzi I felt a difference No more stomach pains or cramps or needing to run to the bathroom every time I ate this medicine truly is perfect Ive noticed that other people have had issues with it and I see a few have mentioned that they dont have a gallbladder and it works fine for them I do not have a gallbladder and it has been the most helpful medicine Ive been on yet so maybe it has something to do with not having a gallbladder Anyways this medicine does work for me and hopefully anyone reading this that has wanted to try it will take the good comments into consideration and try it out You never know unless you try Just read the directions and DO NOT drink alcohol like it says
1577,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7,42643,14,Female over here I have had IBSD for about years since I had my gallbladder removed Ive only been taking Viberzi for a couple of days so far and while I started getting abdominal cramps day two theyre not awful and something I hope will not get worse but Im having maybe bms a day and not running to the toilet every time food touches my lips Its such a relief to not have bathroom issues every time I eat anything Im praying this keeps working and the cramps go awayl with time
1578,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42641,13,I have been dealing with IBSD since I was about years old I am now The uncontrollable cramping and diarrhea gave me no quality of life I wouldnt leave my house or do anything What kind of life is that for a young adult Back in December my doctor told me about viberzi This has been a GOD SEND medicine I have my life back The second week I started taking it though I woke up in excruciating pain I went to the ER and I had a spasm of the sphincter of oddi I stopped viberzi for a few days then went on the mg and I take it once a day I FINALLY can live a normal life and not worry every seconds about where the bathroom is
1579,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42634,15,I have been on this medicine for a almost weeks and I finally have my life back The only thing I am noticing is I cant eat as much which is a good thing I also have some itching on my arms but not sure if its from the Viberzi
1583,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42621,24,First taking this drug I was skeptical because of the reviews where not assuring but I tried it anyways because I had no where else to turn with the discomfort of IBS I have been taking this medication for months and it has done wonders worst part for me was starting the medication which gave stomachs cramping and fatigue tho only lasted a couple days during the second month I experienced constipation which was very new to me so I followed up with the doctor He insisted for me to take only once a day instead of twice and I have had complete relief of the constipation in as little as three days I do not have a gallbladder and this medication Works for me
1585,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42618,12,I hv suffered with IBSD for about years Finally in July I had had it I was starting to avoid activities or road trips as I was terrified of having an accident Many times I did My dr prescribed Viberzi and right off I had a reaction so I cut it down to one pill a day It was a dream come true I felt normal days ago my diarrhea was back so I kicked it up to pills a day Im hoping the drug will continue to work for me I was at my wits end
1588,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42610,17,I got viberzi and took pills a day mgI took them for weeks and had to stop I couldnt have a bowel movementI woke up one Sunday morning at am and my stomache felt like a volcano Finally I had a bowel movement and it felt like I lost pounds It didnt work for me because you cannot go that long without a bowel movement I Got this medicine for IBS and diarrheaIt stopped the diarrhea and stopped all bowel movementI literally thought I was going to die because my stomache was hurting so bad I was hoping this medicine would work but it didnt
1589,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42601,8,Unfortunately this medication did absolutely nothing to help me I spent days in misery just waiting for it to quotkick inquot Went back to Imodium MultiSymptom amp MUCH better already Hope somebody else has better luck with this drug Luckily my doc had a ton of samples so I didnt have to pay for it
1591,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42598,12,I have had IBSD for years and was diagnosed with anal cancer years ago and treated with radiation and chemotherapy Ive tried all kinds of natural supplements antifunglals and meds with only Immodium giving me some freedom but stopping the pain Ive been on Viberzi for weeks and had normal BMs for the first week but the med doesnt seem to be quotholdingquot like it did before Im experiencing bloating and two loose stools a day now I will probably go back to adding some Immodium Ive also been experiencing some racing heartbeats and will contact my gastro
1592,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42594,20,Ive been on Viberzi for a little over a month now and its been fantastic My only problem is each morning when I take it i always feel like my arms way pounds so I lay down for a little while until that passes but then Im good to go for the rest of the day Ill take a little discomfort in my muscles for a day of not having to worry about pooping my pants
1595,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42589,27,Viberzi has changed my lifeI take it for IBS and I am very grateful for this medicine I have been on it about months now I was the first person my Gastro doctor perscribed it to If I forget to take a dose I will know because my symptoms come right back and I take my pill and Im fine again I do not forget to take it very often My insurance does not cover the medicine but I have a discount card and I only pay a month co pay The original price is way to high It is over one thousand dollars I could never afford that monthly
1597,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42767,15,I took it for about weeks and one night I woke up around am with severe pain that radiated to my back with heavy puking and the pooping Went to the hospital and they told me I had Pancreatitis and took me off viberzi Spent days in the hospital with IV Fluids and no eating Horrible experience
1598,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3,42765,13,Worked great for the first months then nothing Went right back to same misery I have dealt with for years Doctor even increased dosage even though people without a gallbladder are not supposed to take the higher dosage The higher dosage actually made things worse for me and the cramps last even longer than they normally do which is pretty bad so since it was no longer working I stop taking it It did seem like a miracle drug at first but unfortunately Im one of the people that it no longer works for after three or four months
1599,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42764,16,This is definitely been a miracle drug for me Im finally regular I take one mg tablet before bed because it makes me sleepy Occasionally Ill take one if my stomach starts cramping up Makes you feel heavy sometimes I used to take sleeping medicine cuz I couldnt sleep from the pain Two birds one stone Best thing my doctor has recommended Ask for a free sampleits worth a try
1603,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42751,21,Ive been taking this medication for two months now At first I was taking the full dose but I never had a BM so I lowered to mg once a day I havent had an IBSD attack since Ive taken it I still have my A flare ups sometimes but its really been a lifesaver The downside is that my BMs have now gone to every th day and when I do go its in very small amounts is painful and I usually end up having to skip a few days of viberzi to get it all out The medicine definitely works For me it works too well Im going to do a follow up with my doctor I dont want to give up this medicine but I dont think its healthy to be constipated all the time either
1605,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42745,17,Dealt with IBSD for over years Imodium helped but still had anxiety about going anywhere Started taking Virbezi about weeks ago Having very good resultsexcept for fatigue and major gas I could resurrect the Hindenburg Finally got Blue Cross to pay for it really expensive After reading some of these reviews I am hoping that I am one of the lucky ones and it continues to work I have a life again
1606,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42738,25,started this medication about two months ago hard to get BC to pay for it but after I did it was a life saver after suffering from IBSD for years and having a particularly rough flare up over months after one week I was NORMAL I feel so much better now I know it might not work for everyone but it did for me I dont have a gallbladder and only take one per day
1607,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42723,0,Not covered by insurance
1608,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42718,28,I have been taking Viberzi mg for about months I do not have a gallbladder and almost years ago I had a bowel blockage I have had diarrhea at least x a week with high anxiety for travelling At first I took this medicine for weeks mg x a day and didnt have a BM for days so I went off of it for a few days then tried again same result and very bad stomach pain With problems continuing I found many reviews being too constipating so I started taking pill every morning WITH FOOD Since I adjusted the dose over months ago it has worked great I now have a REGULAR BM almost everyday sometimes x a day I have had diarrhea x in the last months this has helped me get back to living amp work It helped me
1610,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42716,26,Suffered from IBSD and anxiety for years Recently had a month bout of terrible IBSD Became a hermit Didnt want to leave the house had huge panic attacks about traveling and became very depressed Finally went to doctor Had problems filing this med with health Alliance but BCBS covered it Started taking a day each mg and caused opposite problem Now on a day and this is a game changer Its taken awhile to build up in my system but in weeks Ive only had attacks and I was having daily If this stays the course its seriously heaven sent Slowly getting my life back
1612,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42712,16,This drug has worked tremendously for me I take it x a day with food and it has almost ended my rushing to the bathroom I can go about my life without always knowing where the bathroom is It has some bloating and gas side effects but it cut my IBSD down to shreds I use to go times a day and now I have a much more normal schedule Cannot praise this drug enough
1615,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42704,9,Viberzi works well controlling diarrhea of IBS almost too well I have days of passing minimal stool and a constant bloated feeling Since I have only been on this med for two weeks I am hoping my body regulates in time
1616,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42700,18,Viberzi was given to me for ibs and I took pills and ended up in the hospital for a week I honestly thought this drug was going to kill me I had severe pain in my chest and could not take in a full breath The hospital doctors said my pancreas was swelled really bad and putting pressure on my lungs and it was because I had used viberzi
1619,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42669,22,yrs DX of IBSD Collagenous Colitis Chrohns total colectomy wJpouch I have tried every Rx known amp nothing could stop the BMs incontinence nausea GI cramping and rectal spasms from surgery I found Viberzi read pt reviews Allergan Pharm documentation I was on mg x daily Similar symptoms the first few days by the rd day major decrease in stool frequency and gut motility Then towards my th day it abruptly quit working I became severely ill nausea vomitingheadache GI had me stop taking Viberzi vomiting amp D in bed a week GI did blood work and Lipase levels at next week Creatine Lipase still very ill amp no answers my headache off of it for days FDA fasttracked this be careful
1620,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42669,19,I have been on Viberzi mg for about months now I have seen my diarrhea decrease dramatically I also no longer suffer from the upper abdominal pain that used to trouble me almost daily As with some others here I have noticed a kind of sleepy muscle ache feeling about an hour after each dose and a tendency to constipation which I counteract by using fiber supplements Overall this has made my life much better and allowed me to eat foods I could not eat before My insurance has covered the costs
1621,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42579,21,IBS D for over yr tried everything but nothing worked Took Viberzi and immediately my D was gone Life was so much better For those of us who suffer with IBSD it was a miracle I felt normal and healthy first time since the is No side effects at all Unfortunately after months is stop working like some other users noticed the symptoms slowly started to come back First the gas then the diarrhea It has been mo since I started to take it I am about better than I was before Viberzi ndash I guess I will take it and pray that it will not get worst but it is a little disappointment
1623,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42576,18,Took this drug days on the th day I became ill Pain in the abdominal area felt like I was having a heart attack or severe indigestion The pain was terrible for an hour Took a tramadol to ease the pain Entire body felt weak and achy After a few hours I was able to get out of bed and continue my day but felt like I had been run over by a truck I do not have a gallbladder and the bowel movements while not watery while on viberzi was scant and I had terrible gas and gas pains Off the med today IBSD is back The watery bile in BMs is back Ill take that over the bad pains and feeling bad
1624,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42569,14,I was giving the drug last Wednesday and started it Thursday morning Things were fine that day I woke up Friday morning in lot of muscle pain thought it from my sleep I took my morning pill and went through my day feeling very sorry my abdomen started getting tighter all day I was feel sick and couldnt even eat dinner The rest of the night I was in oain vomiting and never had a bowel movement that daythis is the fourth day and have diarrhea and very little appetite I of course did not continue the medicine after Friday morning
1625,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42566,16,Viberzi is working great for me All medications can have adverse side effects as well as the potential to lose some effectiveness over time if taken frequently For these reasons as well as taking care of my body in general I try to stick to the low fodmap diet designed for IBS as those are the foods my body can pricess well I do not have to take a pill every day Only on days when I splurge on something I know has the potential to make me sick or if I find myself in a situation where I dont have any low fodmap food options I dont use the medication as a crutch to start eating anything and everything I want
1627,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42559,11,I have taken viberzi for only about one week The drug works very well at controlling IBSD for the first week although my gastro doctor suggested that I continue to take dicyclomine at the same time The side affects are that it makes you very tired and gives you additional nausea as if IBS did not have enough nausea all on its own If you are over years of age and on medicare this drug might be a quotteaserquot in that it works fairly well but the drug cost is not covered by medicare or most other supplementary plans The drug is waaaaaay overpriced When looking at drug discount coupons the best cost that I got is per month The cost of the drug is not worth the benefits when other drug will provide some diarrhea relief
1629,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42556,15,Have been taking Viberzi for a month now for IBSD and I cant be happier I have ZERO side effects Thank you for making me normal again
1630,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42552,17,Added Viberzi to mg of Wellbutrin Out of the gate Viberzi worked very well But the positive results started declining after about days After months Im not sure its working at all
1631,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42550,24,I have IBSD Ive tried with different drugs Xifaxan included but anything helps me too muchDuring the first month of taking Viberzi mg my symptoms changed dramatically in a good way I started being able to eat different food included some of the ones that I used to avoid chocolate burgers etc just felt bloated and had more gasBut I have to say that after the first month the effect is declining and now th month is helping a littleSo better than in the past but not as helpfull as it was at the beginingDoes anyone felling the same about the declining effect
1633,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42531,20,Ive struggled with IBSD for the last years and nothing has helped until I tried Viberzi Viberzi allows me to enjoy my day without running to the bathroom constantly This medicine is a life saver I saw results within the first couple of days
1634,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42531,28,I have had IBS D for years but controlled with immodium and bentylThree years ago it was uncontrollableCould not leave the house Stool cultures colonoscopy blood work xrays and scans due to pain all negative Immodium didnt workDoctor termed as unspecified colitis and IBS D Now taking lomotil hyoscyamine donnatol and cholestyramineThis makes life bearableTried xifaxin and did nothingNow got the mg viberzi x daily Took one pill with food yesterday morning Within minutes my legs turned to rubber heart was racing cold sweat and difficulty breathing The heart racing and breathing went away within half hour but the rubber legs lasted about five hrsSevere abdominal pain gasmetal taste til last nite No more
1635,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42521,32,This product needs to come off the market I landed in the hospital for days with severe Acute Pancreatitis Renal Failure Liver Hepatitis Oddi spasm etc I am female I dont drink or do rec drugs After taking this my liver amp pancreatitis enzy where over x the normI had L stabbing pain within mins of taking Viberzi for the first time I thought I was dying I could barely breath amp I buckled over in pain I took antiacid thinking it might help but it didnt amp with time the pain transformed to my mid back my entire GI felt like it was on fire amp if My belly got touched it would bring me to tears a fever started a few hours laterI have had a MUCH milder pain belly reaction to VicodineOxi but never like this
1636,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42517,23,Ive had IBSD for over years Ive had many embarrassing moments over the years and the disease has limited my lifestyle most of the time Immodium helps but not always I finally got the point where I could not deal with this anymore there are things I want to do that I cant because Ive always got to be near a bathroom I finally got a referral to a digestive health clinic to get this figured out After many tests and conversations with the doc we settled on some diet changes and this new drug Viberzi Ive only taken the drug for a few days but I am already seeing great results I hope they continue for a long time Im not having the urgency I had before Im down to one BM a day now and feeling much better
1637,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42514,28,I have been taking Viberzi for a couple months now Prednisone was the only thing that was able to control my Lymphocytic colitis I am now on Viberzi in addition to Imuran and it has been working tremendously No more diarrhea I can eat most food I wasnt able to eat before I found myself sick with a bug last week which resulted in diarrhea I took my nighttime Viberzi dose and had no more diarrhea after that I saw some of the reviews here and wanted to give my opinion and share how well its worked for me
1638,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42506,31,Well Ive had IBS issues for almost years now My prior Doctor put me on some other meds that helped with the have Diarrhea and stomach pain like nervousuneaseanxious I have no reasons for these feeling at the bottom of my stomach But the currents help but I still have those feeling and Ive kinda learned to live with them I heard about this new Drug and ask my doctor to let me try it and being on Viberzi mg two times a day Now for days those feeling are like gone and no side effects I cannot believe it my BM are close to normal food does not go straight thru me and those anxious feeling have disappeared It has REALLY helped thus far May
1639,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42500,29,I took doses and was rushed to ER this morning with chest pain They treated me as if I was having a heart attack I am admitted and tests are being run Everything is pointing to this new drug I took Also had dry mouth and confusion Could hardly speak
1640,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42495,27,I had diarhea from my IBS and Took doses of mg over a period of a week and had a severe case of pain due to sphincter oddi The pain was so severe in chest back and abdomen and radiated down right arm Also severe confusion and fainting prior to pain onset The pain was immediate with no warning I was transported by EMS to the ER I was given trial packages that did not include side effects It did stop the diarrhea but the side effects were not worth it
1641,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3,42494,17,Have suffered from IBSD for approximately years The only medication that gives me relief from my symptoms has been Imodium tabs per day I tried Viberzi for just three days because my symptoms became so frequent from not using the Imodium that I wasnt able to leave the house for more than an hour or two I hope Viberzi works better for other people who try it Very disappointing for me to say the least I gave it three out of ten because it did firm up the first BM of the day and had no noticeable side effects
1642,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42491,23,Found this new drug on the internet had to beg my doctor to let me try it since he had never heard of it With what I was seeing online I thought this may be the drug to give me my life back Nope it didnt work for me it actually made me feel like a had to go more I didnt have any side effects other than that I was on the mg dose x a day I have had IBS D for over years and have taken a lot of Imodium to control my symptoms and maybe that had something to do with this drug not working for me But its great that they are trying to come up with new treatments maybe the next one will work for meI can only hope
1644,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42477,43,this medication was a miracle in my life but it cost so much I will have to continue to struggle with not eating outside the view of a restroom its a shame that the drug companies charge such a high price for something that truly changes your life when your on fixed income you cant pay a month for a medicine no matter how good it is
1645,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42472,30,Ive been on this med for about a month now I dont think Ive gone this long without an attack since I was pregnant My IBSD went away with both pregnancies weird I know This drug has been amazing The only side effect I have is constipation I take a stool softener right now because I keep forgetting to buy fiber pills and nausea if I dont take it with food directions tell you to so thats on me Give it a try Remember a lot of insurance companies wont cover it yet because its new but they have a savings plan you can sign up for Take advantage of it
1646,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7,42469,44,I have battled stomach issues for years now Im only No doctor has found the problem in the past Ive tried many different medications every diet known and still received no relief I was in the bathroom with diarrhea times a day and that was on a good day My doctor prescribed Viberzi x a day I took my my first pill in the morning and by the evening my diarrhea had completely went away However I do have side effects gas and bloating the feeling of being loopy dry mouth loss of appetite and now constipation Im trying some stool softener to see if itll help but Im going to keep experimenting until I find something that works Its been extremely nice not having to run to the bathroom times a day though
1650,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42455,22,I had microscopic colititsSevere abdominal pain a couple hours after taking med Dried out mucosa of mouth so much could hardly talk Also dried out eyes so much took a day of using artificial tear drops every two hours to make eyes comfortable
1652,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42448,31,I have struggled with IBSD for years Ive been in every medication available including antidepressants bentyl loperimide lotronex colestramine and many others The Viberzi seems to control the diarrhea but I am experiencing debilitating gas Especially in the mornings but it lasts throughout the day Its not just inconvenient its painful and uncontrollable I want this medicine to be the one I just dont know how to combat the gas I am also having abdominal pain but will stay the course to see if these subside
1653,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3,42446,19,I have taken both the mg and the mg Viberzi When I started on this medication mg it worked somewhat My diarrhea was slowed and the stool more solid However after being on it for a month or a little longer the benefits decreased I went from having to bowel movements a day to having or more Usual pattern was first movement was the most solid the next ones were more loose and runny My doctor increased the strength of Viberzi to the mg Same basic issuesworked good at first but after using for a while I was back to having or more movements with the first one the most solid I am again trying the lower dose as the cost of the mg was way too expensive even with Medicare and my supplement drug plan
1654,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42435,23,Started this medication today after being on bentyl for years Noticed within a few hours I was having side effects Muscle pains nausea loss of appetite Hopefully these subside and this medicine works My insurance covered most of the cost so pricing wasnt too awful
1655,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42410,52,I have been struggling with stomach issues for several years now and have gone through lots of bloodwork colonoscopies stool samples different diets you name it Turns out I have IBSD and also battle anxiety on a daily basis which makes it worse My symptoms include cramping urgency severe diarrhea upwards to x a day and sometimes rectal bleeding Im often late for work because Im stuck in the bathroom or afraid to leave the house I started taking mg twice a day of Viberzi and its been absolutely amazing I am currently days diarrhea free with very minimal cramping Hoping it stays this way forever I tried Xifaxan back in November and that did nothing for me Its an expensive medicine but its worth it for me
1657,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,43047,0,I had a UTI and It helped with my pain but only brought on terrible back pain it hurt so bad I couldnt breath or move it was worse than the uti pain Lets just say after one day they are in the trash and I embrace uti pain worse product ever
1659,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,42955,2,I took it while at work It never calmed my pain I plan on going to get some AZO
1662,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,42672,7,I was in pain one might so i drove to kroger at in the morning bought this because it said it had more strength than azo so I took them as soon as i walked out the store drive home sat in my car for an hour to still be in pain These pills do not work i drove back to kroger got the azo brand and was in relief within mins dont waist your money on this brand
1664,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42585,25,I had to come home early from work thought I needed the ER Called my sis and she said to try Uricalm first SOOOO glad I took her advice I went from fetal position with nausea and pain to almost complete relief in less than an hour LESS THAN AN HOUR Ive never written a review for anything in my life but this was beyond amazing that I couldnt help but pass this along to fellow hurting mamas Im still cranberrying and antibioticing it up but my symptoms have totally subsided From tears to cheers Im in total disbelief Hahaha I sound like an infomercial but I promise Im real good luck
1665,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,42536,4,Did absolutely nothing to help with the burning or pain Just made me queasy and turned my pee highlighter orange Total waste of
1666,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42463,14,I was experiencing early symptoms of a UTI I felt like I had to go to the bathroom even after I had just been and it was very uncomfortable feeling I wouldnt say it burned like UTIs usually do it just felt like I had to go really bad I got an at home UTI test strip and sure enough I had it I got the URICALM at my local CVS store in hopes it would give me some kind of relief I drank a oz of cranberry juice and three water bottles with tablets in hours and that night I felt better I was worried I would have to go to the doctor and get on antibiotics but with URICALM that wasnt the case Very affordable It comes in a pack and it only took to help me I would recommend this especially if you are catching it early
1667,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42411,16,I got a UTI on the last day of my vacation with hours of plane rides to get through On my way to the airport I stopped at the drugstore for some recommended Azo I saw Uricalm Max and decided to give it a try since it was on sale Best Decision Ever I went from nearly crying sitting with nothing coming out yet feeling like I was going to pee myself whenever I stood up to feeling completely normal When I got home I went home and saw a doctor I was prescribed the usual antibiotics and urinary analgesic Uricalm Max works much better and for longer than the medication from the pharmacy same price AND I can get uricalm over the counter to help until I can see a doctor for antibiotics
1669,Uricalm,Dysuria,9,42230,15,IT works like a charm I took two pills last night and I was able to sleep without discomfort I really recommend I bought the Uricalm MAX
1671,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42157,16,This OTC medicine was the first to make me stop feeling any pain at all One day I had to pull over during my commute to use the restroom at a Parkway rest stop I commute over miles to work every day and have never had to stop By AM I was aware I had a UTI On my way home I purchased this product with no idea what it could do but my doctor couldnt see me for three more days Within minutes the constant pain was gone
1672,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,41972,17,Works very quickly Prefer this over any other brand
1673,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,41368,53,Ive had urinary tract infections since I was little My mom always bought these numbing pills and they worked like a charm Im having one at the moment and my mom bought Uricalm Works within minutes for me and totally takes away the pain These things work for hours and hours And the higher the dosage the better it works Total life saver if your having any bladder problems
1674,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,41199,34,It worked a couple minutes after taking it I was relieved

1709,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42876,2,Ive had menstrual migraines since my late teens I also have an aspirin allergy so my pain relief was going to urgent care amp getting phenergan shots with codeine The pain didnt stop it just allowed me to sleep Then a fellow migraine sufferer told me about zomig Its a miracle I take mg as soon as I feel the quotmigraine feelingquot and lay down in a dark room hours later I take another Im good for hours I can function Go to work Run my house etc I then take one more since my migraines are anywhere from days This is the first medicine that actually wipes my migraine out amp not just dulls it My side affects are dry mouth fatigue foggy head tingling feet amp legs But heyId take those any day over a migraine
1710,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42875,2,Been taking Zomig for about a year for common migraines without aura I think I never know if a serious migraine is coming on but Zomig seems to work for it all I break the mg pill in half at first if its not bad then take a whole mg pill if I wake up to a headache the next day My headaches used to last days switching sides Imetrex seemed to work but it made my arms and chest feel heavy Zomig has less side effects and seems to work just as well I do have a few side effects but I associate them with relief so they dont really bother me A pill will put me out and Ill sleep really well my skin gets sensitive to temperature showers will sting a little and as soon as the headache subsides Ill feel a little euphoric
1711,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42873,1,Have had migraines for decades and tried imitrex before but didnt help I get minor relief from Bayers Back amp Body aspirincaffeine pill Recently asked my doc about trying a different triptan and he suggested zolmitriptan since imitrex didnt help Next migraine I took Bayer and the mg zolmitriptan pill with gatorade Two hours later my migraine was decreasing instead of increasing but was still in pain so I took the other of the mg pill and was surprised to see my migraine decrease until it was gone and I was able to sleep through the night without migrainain pain Now I take the entire mg at once with bayer and gatorade once I notice symptoms and it decreases my migraines from hrs of hell to around tolerable hours
1712,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42870,2,An amazing drug ZomitriptanIt clears my headache in minsI realise how much I need this drug having suffered with Migraine for a hr period I am doing a tour of the world at age yrs old I ran out of this drug in Australia Had to pay over one hundred dollars to see a Dr and pay for two tabs on prescription I get six tabs a month on a free prescription in Scotland Missing home
1713,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42856,2,Maxalt did nothing and oral sumatriptan stopped working so I tried Zomig spray I followed the directions exactly and still got a ton of product dripping down the back of my throat which is normal Either my migraine kept getting worse of the Zomig made it worse Either way this did not work for me
1715,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42809,3,I Suffered with dreadful Migraine ever since I was around years old so bad my arm used to be paralysed and speech was severely affected with almost stroke like symptoms I had so much time off school and also my places of employment in later life and I had to cancel shows trips out etcAt the age of I was prescribed Zomig and it changed my life I only need a quarter of a tablet and after minutes I feel fine and the only side effect is a slight sensitivity to hot drinks and hot water which wears off after an hour or so I cant believe all those years I have suffered and the way Migraine ruled my life I am years old this year and whilst I feel happy to be curedI feel I have been robbed of many years
1716,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42802,3,The nasal spray is amazing pills no where as good Insurance wants you to try the pill first The spray is a miracle
1718,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42761,2,I have been having migraines since I was very young and now I found I couldnt travel anywhere and couldnt go out in the sun Ive have been taking zomig for years and usually it just stops my migraine straight away must admit it has given me my life back But yesterday while I was driving a long distance it came on quick And zomig didnt work as well I think I took it to late when I finaly got home in agony all the side afects started I felt realy ill my throat closed and pain shot around my neck and back Hopefully this wont happen again
1719,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42746,4,I havent found any medication that helps with my migraines Zomig caused me to experience a heat flash which lasted about an hour Onset of neck stiffness not as bad as prior triptan medications used but still limited activities Stinging and increased sensitivity in nose mouth and throat similar to sinus pressure Semipainful Glands sensitive to taste and makes everything quotsourquot reaction Liquid felt in nose and mouth for an hour or so Bad aftertaste and dizzyness Had to lay down and take a nap and side effects were still felt hours later
1720,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42726,8,I had severe migraines with the heavy intense pain and vomiting for about years Tried everything Somethings worked after a few hours but that is a long time if you are in extreme pain and vomiting My nureologist gave me samples of Zomeg and mg The mg completely takes the migraines away within a half hour I dont have any side effects with this This is the first migraine medicine that I can take and actually eventually finish my day It is expensive but if your doctor takes the time to explain everything else you have tried and this seems to be the only option usually your insurance will cover it then This has give me life back and I dont fear so much about migraines as I used to
1721,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42720,7,I began experiencing migraines in my early teens By early s I had tried almost every medicine made without relief My migraines are hormone related and predictable For days during my menstrual cycle and another days during ovulation Without any relief I would end up in emergency room miss work and honestly feel like I wanted to die I couldnt move I would throw up and nothing would help I would literally be in bed in a dark room without moving for days every weeks All I have to say is Thank God for zomig It was life changing Within to minutes of taking zomig I could resume my normal activities as if the debilitating migraine never existed
1722,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42694,2,This drug has changed my life My migraines used to leave me in pain for days along with vomiting sensitivity to light etc the nasal spray works within half hour and usually provides full relief I cant even believe it migraine gone Leaves me w a sore throat but i dont mind it First couple of times it made me sleepy but i got used to it Zomig allows me to move on with my life instead of living my life in pain If you are debating definitely give this a try

1725,Salonpas Pain Patch,Osteoarthritis,2,43004,0,I used the patch and because I thought it was helping reduce the pain of my tendonitis of my wrists I continued using it The pain of neither wrist got worse and my palm hurt and also the fingers A week ago after using Salonpas pain patch for over three months my wrists have swollen and the pain is excruciating I went back too my doctor but because he was not aware that I had used the patch for a long time he thought the swelling of the wrists were due to rheumatoid arthritis The swelling is going down gradually I would like to add here that I am allergic to aspirin and ibuprofen I read the label only yesterday
1727,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,3,42995,0,Ive used salon pas for years I have boxes of them in my car or at home Even at work But these new patches arent good at all I put it on and almost immediately them crinkle up and lift up It really sucks because I like salon pas better than the other pain relieving patches I guess Ill have to try something different Something thatll stay on at least I hope you all bring back the old patches or figure out a different types because these really suck
1728,Salonpas Pain Patch,Osteoarthritis,10,42974,2,I have tried heat pads freeze pads gels tablets and I am really pleased I saw these advertised on the TV I tried them and I had no expectations at all I was very surprised that they worked on my neck pain my hip pain back pain and have no complaints worth giving a go may not be suitable for everyone but worked for me
1729,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,5,42959,0,I too have used these patches for year the white ones They would stay on for hours and hours Now the new beige thin ones wont stay on at all Used one on my wrist fell off after min of constant pushing it down in place Use a new one after thatlasted less than min They have lost a good customer with this quoton the cheapquot adhesive

1731,Salonpas Pain Patch,Osteoarthritis,1,42931,0,I tried this for my pain from a disc spinal fusion and I might as well have spread melted chocolate for all the good these things do I tried the box of patches ingredients camphor wintergreen and methyl salicylate Dont waste your money All you do is walk around reeking of camphor and wintergreen and it has almost NO effect as far as pain The ads for this are very deceiving Id rate this product with a minus if I had the option
1734,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,5,42800,1,I used of the Salonpas with Lidocaine patches for muscle pain in my shoulder and neck area Started getting a rash after the second application The rash is in the shape of the patch very itchy and bumpy and looks like it could blister
1735,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,10,42438,9,Got my free sample of salonpas pain patch the same day I worked straight hours I work in a Vets office in the kennel and most days we do to dog baths a day I was exhausted and sore and I just knew I would be sore and unable to move the next day but I applied solonpas pain patch before bed and woke up ready to face another day I would recommend this to everyone and I will be purchasing more Thank you for the free sample it really works

1739,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42573,6,Experienced bad adverse effect with tablets No problem with nasal spray
1741,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42546,3,Normally my migraines take a few hours to go from the inkling Im getting one to full blown vomiting and feeling like my body is turning inside out with chills and sweating etc After taking this at the inkling stage within mins I was throwing up and it had become a full blown migraine It clearly ramped it up
1742,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42532,0,This medication has pretty much saved my sanity Got diagnosed with migraine years ago after having one so bad doctor thought I was having a stroke Started off getting migraines at or a month but am now up to in a day period so am being investigated for triggers etc but zolmitriptan has been amazing every time Guess Im the lucky one not getting side effects per se but I already suffer from CFSME so wouldnt notice extra fatigue anyway I get this on a UK prescription at tablets each time so maybe poundUK per month
1743,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42504,12,This has been a life changer I get bad migraines a month that last usually over a day or two and it would make me completely non functional The great thing is that this medicine works fast and completely takes away the splitting pain The side effects the first two times were sleepiness and a pretty sore throat and face but since then theyve been extremely mild and almost unnoticable Please try it its worth it
1744,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,4,42504,2,I have had migraines since my s and took zomig last night for the first time only to wake up like I had RA My joints to both hands were in so much pain I could hardly get dress or hold a purse Additionally my hips were in pain I do not reccommend this drug to anyone I know migraines can be debilitating but taking zomig to maybe cause RA or any type of an autoimmune disease is definitely not worth it I never write any reviews but I found others should be aware of side effects
1745,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,42494,0,After suffering years of migraines and using IMIGRAN which did not work for me finally decided to use the nasal spray for migraines Really works well when it wants to but sometimes if the migraine is really bad it wont do anything I get bad side effects such as a swollen tounge and really sore and sensitive mouth but would rather that than a migraine so is good overall
1747,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,42420,7,I have been taking zomig for a couple of years It definitely takes my migraines away but my skin and muscle hurt every time I have to plan showering around it Today I had a very bad reaction after going on a very brisk mile walk My face and skin were flush nauseous and hyper sensitivity to light Migraine came back w a vengeance Felt somewhat like heat stroke which isnt possible as its degrees Almost went to hospital Iced my head and rested Finally feeling better Note to self Do not exert myself on this medication
1750,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42313,4,This is the only medicine for migraine that actually works for me The only side effect I have noticed is skin sensitivity to hotwarm water
1751,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,42301,2,Usually works well but this time Im on my th day of a Migraine Ive had migraines the since I was Now My biggest problem is I have Fibromyalgia all day when I have to take it especially more than one time in a hour period I can hardly move My Body is sensitive to EVERYTHING Water Pressure touch even pressure from laying in bed or sitting in chair It is excruciating I go from a constant daily pain level of an to a It usually lasts about days after I stop taking it But ZomigRelpaxImitrexMidrinall of them do it I think it is all Triptan MedsI cant get rid of this for nothing and am violently vomiting and my Body hurts so so bad that I dont know what to do
1753,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42228,1,I have suffered from chronic Migrain since I was about years old I am now and have been using zolmitriptan for a little over years This prescription has changed my life for the better My migraines controlled my life I could never make plans to do anything because I wasnt sure If I was going to get a migrain attack or not and with my luck times out of I did The first time I look zolmitriptan I was going on my day of a horrible migrain as soon as I swallowed the disolving pill my migrain was goneI find that I get better results in releaving a migrain if I take the pill right when I feel one comingSome side effects for me isfatigue frequent urination hunger and naeousia but well worth the side effects in my opinion
1754,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,42222,1,i find this medication works wanders only downside is hypersensitive to Luke warm water feels like Im standing under boiling water but I find within minuets my migraines are gone with some drowsiness
1755,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42216,0,I find this medicine Sandoz Zomitriptan mg ODT to help allot with the stopping of coming migraine The only thing is I have trouble with is the fact that I cant tell weather or not its going to be a migraine I take it anyways Causes some drowsiness
1758,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42152,5,First time taking the spray amp its horrible It made me vomit made my migraine worse my nose feels weird amp hurts amp I want to fall asleep Horrible
1761,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42096,7,Zomig is a miracle for me The only drawback is my insurance only will pay for tablets a month and sometimes I need more
1762,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42072,1,Lifelong migraine sufferer This medicine is the best thing for killing a migraine Whether I take it as soon as one starts or try to suffer through it for a day or so using over the counter meds I know once I take a Zomig I will have relief with a half hour I am extremely thankful this medicine exists
1763,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42063,8,I have had migraines since the age of Now and still get them I have been taking Zomig for the past years and they are the only tablet that have helped me At first the dosage was mg and was bought down to mg as the side effects made me feel as though my arms and chest were really heavy and was accompanied by a very dry mouth and was not able to drink anything hot Sometimes I get very tired the day before the migraine hits and I know its time for a Zomig I still get these sensations but not all of the time I pay every month tablets expensive but it works My only worry now is that after the age of it is not advisable to take them I wonder what am I going to do
1766,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,41923,6,I get relief from Zomig I cant drink hot drinks like coffee or tea though unless I have lots of milk in it If I take a shower the water hurts my skin unless I have the temperature very low I dont know why Zomig gives a sensitivity to hot water amp hot drinks It does clear the headaches I get tired though
1767,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,2,41774,4,The side effects far outweighed the benefits Before I ever noticed that a migraine had begun to subside I was overwhelmed with the most awful tingling sensation It literally felt like I had a full body rash and as though something was crawling on me mixed with the tingly sensation when your foot falls asleep I also got very weak and nauseous and occasionally light headed It was dreadful I finally decided it was easier to take my regular migraine meds and treat the actual migraine symptoms than to deal with the side effects of Zomig The only reason Im giving it a is because it did slightly lessen the actual migraine
1768,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,41758,11,Ive used Zomig for around years now if taken as soon as recognise an attack I know that about mins later the pain in head will go longer if its into the attack I have always experienced drowsiness and hyper sensitivity all over my skin if I were to have a shower within hours of taking Zomig my whole body feels like its stinging hot drinks feel like they are burning my throat hand washing with hot or warm water is a no no Also if I eat within hours it will feel like my taste buds have exploded excruciating but brief pain I also still get all the other migraine symptoms stomach upset fatigue very irritable even with the Zomig but I guess I can function with those things its the head pain and sickness thats worst
1769,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,41724,21,Zomig gets rid of my migraine but it knocks me out I take one dose and then sleep for hours Afterward the headache is gone but my joints ache and my muscles are very tender to the touch
1770,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41690,13,I have recently gone to a headache specialist after thinking no one is going to help me with my migraines and constant tension headaches She gave me Zomig and it does really work The first time I tried it I wasnt sure my headache was a migraine since it felt different then the one Ive always experienced It wasnt throbbing from front to back all on one side but it did really hurt bad all on one side I was pleasantly surprised Maybe it was a different kind of migraine since I have just weaned off of Excedrin and years of Tramadol use A couple of days ago I had a bothersome headache that had been off and on in intensity for days then turned into the normal migraine I have been accustomed to and the Zomig took care of it
1771,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41625,29,This is the first medicine that actually ALWAYS gets rid of my migraine with minimal side effects Its like a miracle as far as Im concerned
1772,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,41600,6,Wonder pill as far as Im concerned I worry in case I run out or horror of horrors they stop making it The pain and other migraine symptoms seem to switch off in less than an hour after taking it and side effects of soresensitive throat are not bothersome I used to have or more a month lasting days and nothing would make me comfortable
1773,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41584,17,This medicine has changed my life and allowed me to have a semi normal routine even with multiple migraine attacks through the month It almost always works for me within an hour and though it is very expensive it is well worth it It is the only medicine I have taken that has helped me
1774,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41454,21,I have been a migraine sufferer for over years and several of the quottriptansquot have proved to be effective as Ive found out as my insurance has dictated but Zomig continues to be my go to remedy Over years ago I found that if I took a triptan and lit a cigarette my heart would race That was probably a very good thing as the choice between getting rid of the migraines or getting rid of the cigarettes became easy Zomig allows me to function even when I wake up with a full blown migraine I count on it
1775,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,41419,6,Zomig is effective though I occasionally require a second dose After taking Zomig I experience stiffness and achiness throughout my body Warm water feels very hot on my hands and if I drink tea it has to be barely warm or it feels like it is burning my mouth Sometimes after several days of migraines treated with Zomig I am so sore all over that I have trouble walking or doing anything physical I have fibromyalgia and it seems like Zomig makes it worse more painful
1776,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41391,9,Zomig has been a miracle for me I had debilitating migraines for twenty years and had given up on finding anything that would help me In a new doctor prescribed Zomig and I have never had another debilitating migraine When I have health insurance its great Without insurance outrageously expensive per month But I am scared to try a different medicine even though my insurance pushes for the change
1778,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41307,12,I started getting migraines in the military The clinic doctor did not know what they were and was just given a bunch of pain pills that only lowered the pain a little I suffered for many years downing anything I could get About years later I got insurance and saw a neurologist and diagnosed them as migraines and gave me a script for Zomig It worked GREAT Then within a year the company folded and I was out of insurance again When I found out about the VA they started giving me Zomig amp got my migraines under control again amp started to work on my other problems
1779,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41180,14,Works wonders every time The first time I tried Zomig my limbs felt kinda noodly but that only happened the first timenever again It worked so fast I could feel the pain dissolving within minutes It tasted sweet and dissolved very quickly with no yucky aftertaste I have even taken just one half of the g tablet hard to do cause its so little and fragilewhile at work because I was concerned about side effects The half dose still knocked out the migraine and no side effects
1781,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41052,12,I LOVE Zomig I was bedridden for days almost every month for years from horrible migraines I thought I had tried everything to no avail including Imitrex and many others and then went to a new neurologist to ask for Botox based on another doctors suggestion He gave me samples of medicines I had never tried The st one didnt work cant recall what it was and the nd was Zomig Bingo Finally something that worked even after the headache has set in So expensive though very minimal coverage by insurance
1782,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,41026,5,Zomig ZMT works well for me so far years on it after Maxalt seemed to be less effective I begin vomiting and nothing can help me then so orally disintegrating tablets or a shot is all I can do My migraines always seemed to be hormonal but now that Im postmenopause I still get them Maybe fewer but just as severe without treatment Lifetime sufferer with family history father his brother his sister his mother his brothers daughter me all of my kids Having these migraine medicines work is like a miracle
1783,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41025,1,Zomig gave me my life back Its the only medicine that has worked for my migraines and of the time gets rid of them I still occasionally have an all day throwing up migraine but normally thats if Ive woken up with a bad one Only side effects Ive noticed are in the last couple of years I tend to get a cold sore a couple of days after taking the tablets Asked the doctor but hed never heard of that before so I put it down to general low resistance Only problem is I tend to put off taking the tablets because I dont want the cold sores but general analgesics really have no effect and tend to cause stomach upsets
1784,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,40945,4,First reaction was all over tingling and pain Then my skin felt like something was crawling all over and I still have a headache I have had similar reactions to Maxalt and Imitrex
1788,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,40809,4,Zomig ZMT works well for me especially when I take it just as I get the feeling I will get a migraine All migraine symptoms are gone within minutes My side effects aredrowsiness but not so much that I cant function I just yawn a lot some neck stiffness taste sensitivity the first several bites of food after letting the tablet dissolve cause my tastebuds to feel really funny sort of a sharp feeling if that makes any sense at allBUT those symptoms are a lot better than having a migraine
1789,Zolmitriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40794,11,I have suffered with quotcluster headachesquot for over years Finally I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with cluster headaches and migraine headaches years ago Cluster headaches would come in my case in March and October Whenever I would fall asleep at night I would awaken with horrible cluster headache This would happen for about weeks Zomig mist worked every time Unfortunately since August pattern has changed NOW every time I lay down or I could be sitting and BAM I feel the symptoms creeping up on me Yes the Zomig mist works like a charm and I have tried the dissolving tablets too the mist works faster Why so expensive Big problems with insurance coverage regarding quantity too Help me Astra Zeneca
1790,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40721,11,Out of the five or so migraine medicines Ive tried Zomig is easily the best The caveat being you have to take the pill at the onset as soon as you feel symptoms If you wait until the migraine is in full swing it takes much longer for it to work
1791,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40710,12,I have been taking Zomjg for Migraine for the past years I used to suffer for to days with migraine I was prescribed a lot of different medications with no success The first time I took Zomig it took my migraine away within to minutes It has just about always taken all my headaches away from then on Usually one dose tablet takes it away On occasion I have to take a second dose It has improved my quality of life greatly I rarely have side effects also
1792,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,40522,4,Zomig works wonders for me for migraines The only side effect I typically have is hearing my pulse in my right ear Annoying and weird but not a dealbreaker I take a high dose of Effexor and have no interactions that I know of However I once took it with Ambien and that was a big mistake as even the next day I felt offbalanced and weak I also try not to take it within hours of Tylenol for similar reasons Its nice to have a medicine that works so well so consistently
1794,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40504,11,This is the only medication that will work for my migraines My family doctor does fear I am taking too much A lot of things trigger my migraines but I will swear on this particular medication I have tried everything Unfortunately the cost is outrageous and the insurance companies do not like paying for it
1795,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,40489,6,I have tried a countless number of remedies and Zomig is the only thing that has worked for me I do have a couple of side effects to mention Sensitive skin pain to the touch tingling in my extremities achey joints and muscles and excessive urination Although these side effects dont happen everytime I use it Zomig has been a miracle for me I have suffered migraines for years I can live with the side effects and only hope my migraines will go away with menopause like the doctors have told me
1797,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40343,3,My migraines appear hormonal related premenopausal in my s If taken at onset Zomig is very effective against my migraines If taken later it is still effective but requires another dose within a few hours as directed to get the pain under control HOWEVER if taken then Ive had the stiff neck and jaw thing I do notice that my skin is sensitive to heat after Ive taken Zomig and my taste buds are sensitive to some flavors excessive salivating It does make me dizzy I usually break a tablet in half which I was just reading youre NOT supposed to do but it doesnt say why and if I catch the migraine fast enough half is usually enough to deter it I save the other half for later if the migraine feels like it is returning
1799,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,40268,2,This product seemed to work really fast but sometimes it wouldnt take care of all the pain from the migraine Also I noticed when I do a hard body workout at the gym and if I get a migraine the next day or two after that workout the medicine made my body ache real bad My chest arms and legs would really hurt from the constricting blood vessels
1800,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,40162,6,I had migraines for years before I finally was sent to a neurologist He gave me a samples of many of the prescription migraine medications that are out there now and many of them including Imitrex just did not work or made me really fatigued Zomig worked really fast and I have no side effects at all If I can take it as soon as I can feel the headache coming on it is gone before I really realize it
1801,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,3,40141,7,I was given this to try for menstrual migraines I only get my migraines the first day of the last day of and sometimes halfway between periods While it did get rid of my migraine the pain got A LOT worse before it went away That was the one and only time I used this medication
1802,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,40133,7,I would just like to say it is very important to know what other medications you are taking with this medicine It can have very bad side effects I only took this medicine times when I had a very bad interaction It was before they made it known not to mix an antidepressant with it and it took years to find out what really had happened other than a drug interaction I was on Paxil at the time I wound up going to the hospital for them to tell me that everything was fine but it took about a week before I was feeling normal My heartbeat was very rapid I was delusional and uncoordinated It felt like my inside were burning from the inside out but yet I felt a constant chill I am not saying not to take this drug but be careful
1804,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,40060,5,Unfortunately after taking my first dose of Zomig I had an allergic reaction to it Upper lip felt like I was stung by a bee and started to swell up on one side This stayed in the same location for about minutes After that my left cheek started to swell and get numb along with my nose Off to the ER I had to go While it DID kick the migraine I had an unfortunate reaction to it
1805,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40024,12,Ive had migraines for about years They run in the family unfortunately Ive tried a lot of other stuff and also Imitrex Nothing helped at all with my bad headaches until I was given Zomig by my doctor Ive tried both the ZMT and the regular swallow tablets To me they are the miracle pill Just this morning I had a severe migraine one of the worst in a while I was ready to go to the ER it hurt so bad I took a Zomig and about minutes later I could feel the effects I took a nap and woke up without the migraine and was able to come to work today I still get drowsy during the day but it beats having the migraine ruin my life
1806,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40012,5,I use the Zomig nasal spray Out of the or so migraine medicines Ive tried prescription this is the only one that works for me It doesnt take too long to kick in I use it then after minutes the pain starts to ease some and I go take a nap when I wake up its gone
1807,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,39993,2,Works well some sleepiness
1808,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,39981,4,As far as I know Zomig is a swallowed tablet and ZomigZMT is the orally disintegrating tablet with a zingy orange flavor I didnt notice much difference but I imagine the ZMT works faster as it disperses in the mouth With this abortive as with many it works best if you take it during onset of migraine This is an issue for me because sometimes at onset Im not sure if it will actually develop into a migraine so I dont take it and then I am in agony two hours later even with two doses which are nothardly effective since Ive missed onset
1810,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,39913,6,This has helped me in ways no other medicine has It is the best by far in my book It takes about minutes to take effect but completely takes my migraine away and I have my control of my life
1811,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,39901,4,Does not work at all for me
1812,Zolmitriptan,Not Listed / Othe,10,39883,0,I have suffered from migraines since I was a young girl The migraines were absolutely debilitating to me Sick in bed nauseated and vomiting all day until I usually collapsed from exhaustion Zomig has been a miracle drug for me Within an hour the headache is typically gone Occasionally I have to take a second I occasionally feel sleepy and experience a little dry mouth but otherwise have had no side effects It is wonderful to have a remedy to restore my ability to function through the day versus trying to push through work totally debilitated by a migraine
1814,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,39792,4,Except for what I would classify as bad heartburn the drug appears to be very effective
1820,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,9,42171,6,Used early right after flare up works pretty quickly
1821,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42061,17,doc gave me Rx for mg x daily to start i took pills and then more after an hour the first day then just pills daily for the next few days until pain and inflammation is gone this was also Rxed with indomethacin mg x daily along with a drug to coat the stomach x daily I would say my pain after only a few hours subsided from a to a and the next morning was at that is where i am right now i will try an update in a few days
1822,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42060,21,I had a severe gout attack on my left wrist the pain was so bad I thought I was going to pass out My Dr prescribed Colcrys mg times a day By the time I took the nd pill the swelling started to go down and I had enough mobility to perform my job operating a train
1823,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,42018,22,Ive had about to gout attacks over the past year and Im yrs old Overall healthy just like to have way to much fun and eat real good too That being said the gout attack Im suffering with now was a Beast Mode of an attack to my ankle and its lasted for nearly week At first doctor gave me prednisone steroid pack that did absolutely nothing to help Got a shot of cortisone in my back side which didnt help either since the gout is in my ankle in past direct cortisone shot to affected area would do wonders So I call the doctors office after my pain has not gone down and if anything its gone up Doctor gives me ColcryssaysquotSD affect diarrheaquot not on st daynd day for mebut its a miracle medicine Pain free
1825,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,41746,51,I like to say Colcrys is THE BEST I got the prescription barely yesterday and just about hrs later I was without pain on my ankles and my burning disappeared I was able to sleep After being unable to sleep for consecutive days Thanks to this wonderful medication I was able to sleep last night and able to workout As for side effects only soft stools but nothing extreme DEFINITELY I RATHER DEAL WITH SOFT STOOL THAN DEALING WITH ALL THAT BURNING AND PAIN ON MY FEET I truly regret not taking this medicine since yrs ago I just did not know I sadly have gout GLADLY NOW I FOUND COLCRYS
1827,Colchicine,Gout Acute,2,41551,20,I get about flare ups per year always in the side of my big toes Dr prescribed Colcrys mg I honestly dont get any relief that I can tell from this medication I take every hour for a max of pills over hours Seems like the ONLY relief I can get is by flushing my body with tons of water which can take days
1829,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,41462,30,Immediate relief No upset stomach no numbing of fingers just sweet relief I took at onset and eight hours later pain gone in about hours
1830,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,41430,17,Have been on Uloric for months Getting flare ups in knee which Doc says will go away in another month or so Colcrys has terrible side effects but gets the job done on the pain immediately Is a trade off I have to make for a while
1831,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,41419,13,after two days of severe pain and visit to doctor blood work and xray came up with problem never had any type of goutarthritis related problem before crystals were found on my wrist after two days of taking colcrys Wrist is still stiff and hurting but pain is bearable
1832,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,7,41338,8,had bouts in left big toe Second one was so bad couldnt use clutch in car or change geers on bike On a bad day I considered a chisel and malet but about a week after starting colchicine I woke to find pain reduced by and within about weeks so well pleased and no apparent symptoms
1833,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,41214,33,This medication worked for my first acute gout flare although I was prescribed a low dose twice a day because of its toxic property Later I discovered for first dose then an hour later then prophylactic use until flare up was under control The side effects where mainly bowl related It was probably a good idea to start with a low dose but did not get relief until I had to start the dose over with then
1834,Colchicine,Gout Acute,9,41160,28,My doctor put me on Indomethacin during a Gout attack She said that taking Colcrys during a flare up can dislodge uric acid crystals from other parts of the body which can end up in the affected area making it worse After days I am on Colcrys A little bit of upset stomach but I will trade it for the pain any day Manufacturer has printable coupons and voucher to help with the cost Good luck
1835,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,41085,8,I have had gout attacks in both knees elbows wrists big toes thumbs One of my doctors put me on mg of colchicine daily and that worked to control the goutNow the doctor that took over for her said I cant be on daily and now I have had gout in my right thumb and then my left thumb in weeks since I quit the daily dose
1836,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,9,40988,10,Pain and fatigue has been greatly reduced as compared to generic colchicine
1837,Colchicine,Pseudogout Prophylaxis,10,40913,7,Had excruciating leg and knee pain for weeks until finally diagnosed as pseudogout Colchicine did wonders and now virtually pain free Now the bad news Three doctors have said it will no longer be made available
1838,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,40904,3,No attacks while on this medication
1839,Colchicine,Gout Acute,2,40898,36,I have had gout attacks in the last months For my most recent attack and the worst Ive ever had I got virtually no relief from using Colcrys I took the first days of pills but no improvement I switched to Indocin and have had about relief overnight and getting better still The original colchicine was good and acted quickly but something is very different about Colcrys I wont take it again for gout attacks
1840,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,40860,31,Gout is so painful After first doses of Colcrys had immediate relief I had fallen on my knee and was being treated for osteoarthritis with no relief Went to arthritis doctor who told me it was gout in my knee Went on Colcyrs and I can walk again
1841,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,40827,23,I get several gout attacks a year Less side effects but also not as fast acting as Colchicine was Taking more Colcry over several days to obtain relief then when I was taking Colchicine
1842,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,43039,0,Colchicine was very effective when I was to yrs oldstops pain in hrs Now when I take it it causes diarrhoea
1844,Colchicine,Behcets Disease,10,43020,0,I was having severe outbreaks of rashes and canker sores for the last couple of years After months on it Ive only had two minor episodes both never erupted went away in hours
1846,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,42947,7,but my side effects from colchicine were terrible the doc had put me on x mg and then mg every hours hours later I had spontaneous diarrhoea and vomiting for hours unable to eat much and a terrible timeI wanted to warn everyone about the side effects New research says the most effective AND least toxic dose for colchicine is only tablets and then one hour after flare ups
1848,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,42929,6,Extremely prolonged first attack of gout Repeat visits to GP prescribed various drugs then colchicine Only day course Worked within a day Pure relief Side effects really sudden diarrhoea which lasted hours Benefits definitely outweigh side effects
1850,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,42743,8,Safe for weekly consumption One tablet mg per day
1851,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42688,8,Colcrys works for Gout flares Allopurinol barely gets half of Gout patients uric acid down to where they stop having flares Use Uloric mg to lower your Uric acid further than allopurinol could so you DONT have flares anymore because there will be less Uric acid in the body and therefore it wont be stuck in your joints hurting you Its free each month if your Dr writes days and you use the Uloric copay savings card
1852,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,42681,2,My year old takes it everyday and it works
1853,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42677,21,Hello everybody i have chronic gout and osteoarthritis had it for years and am going thru a bad gout attack today right ankle joint feels like somebody busted a empty bottle and broken glass inside my cartilage it is the most pain imagined not even mg hydrocodone helps this is my th or so attacks in my life lost count main cause for me was uric acid caused by drinking beer for many years i never learned yea i took just about everything from several meds indomethacindiflonecallopurinol curently and today colcrys x pills which will knock it out here in about few hours drink plenty water and yea diarrea to flush out comes with it i have cut out drinking for over weeks and just one six pack one day and Bammfull blown gout
1854,Colchicine,Gout Acute,5,42669,10,Best drug for gout is indomethacin if your stomach can handle itColcrys works for some people but it is basically useless for a lot of peopleI still use it because my rheumatologist pushes the issue despite the fact that I tell him its not doing a darn thing for me
1855,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42658,15,I have suffered with an acute gout attack for the first time and my doctor gave me Colcrys I am nearly pain free in less than hours I wish I hadnt waited so long to go to the doctor
1856,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,42649,0,Improvement started immediately after starting medication Complete return to normal function after months on medication Current dose mg daily Stomach issues which may have been from extensive antibiotic use prior to correct diagnosis were resolved with Culturelle Probiotic and recognizing lactose intolerance This drug did cause lactose intolerance
1857,Colchicine,Gout Acute,1,42643,18,Had a bad flare up of gout in my let foot Dr prescribed Colcrys and after three days I had no relief from the pain swelling or burning but I did have terrible nausea and diahrrea Doctor then switched me to Indomethacine and within hours the pain started to subside Now two days later Im about back to normal
1858,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42635,15,Have suffered gout attacks for years Taking the prescribed dosage resulted in diahorea after three days Now I take a single mcg tablet for one or two days at the first sign of an attack This proves effective with no side effects It also means I need to keep a supply of colchicine at hand
1860,Colchicine,Gout Acute,9,42497,13,have had gout attacks since back the heavy beer drinker Quit drinking in and gout attacks down now years old I occasionally get gout attack but I take allopurinol daily has been great but recently had some medium pain in joints son back on Colchicine daily feeling better gotta stay away from greasy meats shellfish but medication works great

1862,Colchicine,Gout Acute,1,42395,11,Had gout in wrist amp knee days on Naproxen hadnt shifted it Blood showed UR as normal so got sent to the emergency room After xrays amp more blood tests Dr decided it was gout amp prescribed days of colchine Apparently it works best at the start of an attack so might be wrongly prescribed My experience was both feet got gout with no easing of pain in other joints while taking it I got the well known side effect but the effect on the gout was worse than neutral
1863,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,42392,3,it saved my life my quality of life before colchicine was very low now I can smile and look to the future only side effect is mild diarrea

1865,Colchicine,Gout Acute,1,42383,11,I have been having gout attacks for about years now My Dr prescribed allopurinol daily to help keep my uric acid levels down I was prescribed Colcrys as an antiinflammatory and I have to say it does absolutely nothing for the pain My wife who has never had a gout flair in her entire life believes Colcrys is a miracle drug So I take it just to humble her I wouldnt suggest this medication to anyone I wish I could give it negative stars as a review
1866,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42374,1,good
1868,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,10,40617,10,This is a great drug for gout flareups The problem is that the cost went from cents per pill to per pill
1869,Colchicine,Gout Acute,9,40172,44,Reduced initial pain extremely fast days later had mildly loose stools slightly crampy stomach
1870,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,40121,16,I am subject to relatively frequent gout flare up every months or so At the first symptoms I take one mg of colchicine every three hours and most of the time after pills the pain is gone I also take pills of imodium to avoid the diarrheaIt works fine for me
1871,Colchicine,Behcets Disease,6,39990,7,Been using colchicine for over years No noticeable side effects but do get my bloods checked annually Only problem was when returned to using it after a two year break Some diarrhea at first but this stopped after a few weeks once body built up tolerance to drug
1872,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,39971,20,This is a useful drug but care must be taken not to take too much when trying to get reliefThe maximum startup dose is usually greater than that needed to create problems in sensitive individuals or if taken with another incompatible drug I took x mg tablets for days recently for an attack of left toe gout whilst starting on Simvastatin for blood lipid lowering and ended up with severe diarrhea without any stomach pain This knocked back the gout attack also but cessation of therapy allowed it back with a vengeance and two very bad nights followedI have cleared the statin after days so will start low dose Colchicine again if needed tonight but keeping to mg max dose in future
1873,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,9,39719,4,Unusual medication but works fast and effectively totally removing gout symptoms

1918,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,42120,9,I have had problems with constipation since I had an intestinal surgery a few years back Recently I had kidney stones and the pain killers led to an obstruction Product seems to work pretty well But I feel I should point out for people saying they now use this product every day After reading the fine print and double checking with my doctor You should never use any laxatives daily unless your instructed to Your body can become dependent on the laxative and may not be able to have a normal movement on its own Even the PG says take days or less Hope everything works out for you all
1919,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,42039,77,It works I went to the er and I was told to take miralax and I am so glad I bought it is a good product I am so happy to be relieved
1920,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,42030,66,Until about years ago when I turned I very rarely had any problems with bowel movements Then I got a toe infection which required antibiotics to clear up It worked but after that I started having problems with constipation I tried more bran and fiber It did not work I tried eating more fruit and vegetables It didnt work It was getting so bad that I started get hemorrhoids that bled bright red blood when I wiped It was scary I had to strain and strain just to get to the bathroom I tried prunes and prune juice and when it did work it gave me the runs and lots of gas and cramping I tried magnesium and in order for it to work I had to take so much that it gave me the runs unexpectedly Miralax worked for me
1921,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,42018,87,I had a bowel obstruction from using lasix and not drinking enough water I was admitted for surgery scheduled the next morning But before the surgery I did use three small bottles under dr Supervision in hospital and my bowel obstruction miraculously untested Today four years later I am constipated from vicodin I used miralax todayAnd my pains went away and I was able to go
1922,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,9,42016,52,Ive been constipated for some time and I couldnt have a normal bowel movement and then a friend reccomended I try Miralax because they were hospitalized and having problems but I tried it the first day and I loved it so much that I do it once a day every day to once every couple of days I highly reccomend this to anyone who suffers with constipation And it also mixes in well with anything you want to drink so its tasteless and easy to drink
1923,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,42003,78,Ive been dealing with a chronic GI problem for about months It caused me to some times because unreliableloose when going to the bathroom So I went on the BRAT diet for a little too long and it got me backed up pretty bad I tried Dulcolax but it didnt do too much My doctor decided I try the last step and take a dose of Miralax I mixed it in a full bottle of juice and all the terrible pain and bloating I had went right away a couple hours later No cramping or anything just mild stomach growling This is a miracle
1924,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41956,104,A few years back I was hospitalized with a bowel obstruction Once I left the hospital my bowel movements have been irregular I couldnt make a movement in over weeks I was force to take stool softeners which never worked and Dulcalax laxatives which did worked but I became constipated after it wore off I went to the doctor and they suggest I try Miralax I gave it a try when day past it only gave me gas nd day past more gas On the rd day with Miralax I was able to have a bowel movement I was very happy because when I take Dulcolax I had cramps and had to have the toilet on standby all day Miralax was a painless soft stool which relieved pressure of constipation And I started having regular movements
1927,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41891,129,I have gastroperesis and rarely have a bowel movement on my own Ive gone weeks easily without a bowel movement Its to the point that when I do go on my own we know that I am severely constipated and that it HAS to come out Abdominal xrays continuously show Im backed up even after going Miralax is not a quotmiracle medicinequot for me It works but only after a few days time However considering that typical laxatives only cause me gas and bloating but no relief I cant really complain Magnesium citrate Linzess Reglan Amitiza have all failed me This is the only relief that I can ever get
1928,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41862,5,I have had trouble with constipation all my life I had taken Milk of Magnesia for a while and started getting pain with that so I talked to doctor she prescribed me MiraLAX I started MiraLAX and I havent had anymore problems since this product is amazing

1932,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41777,185,I have had very painful Irritable Bowel SyndromeConstipation for most of my life and have gone as long as three weeks without a bowel movement It hasnt responded to changes in diet exercise regimens or fiber supplements In fact the fiber made it much worse Other laxatives either dont work or wring me out for days My doctor prescribed Miralax in and I have taken it daily ever since with no problem I still dont go every day but when I do go the stool is soft and the motion is easy and painless I expect to take Miralax forever and have no problem doing so Its a beneficial versatile medication thats definitely worth a shot if youre battling constipation

1938,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,10,41527,55,I suffer from Syringomyelia This is a condition that severely effects your Nervous System The stools that my Digestive Process produces kind of changes from day to day Since I am already on a Whole Foods Diet without any Dairy or Wheat products sometimes Im Regular Other times my stool will either be too hard to get out and thus will stay stuck inside of me for a few days resulting in terrible gasbloating Other times my Stool will be completely liquid and yet because my Nervous System is not responding correctly I just cant flush it out of my Intestines Whenever my Bowels are not functioning correctly all I need is a small dose of Miralax in a Cup of Water and within minutes Im able to go no problem Highly recommended
1941,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41467,104,Ive had constipation problems for years It runs in my family About ten years ago I had to have major hemorrhoid surgery both internal and external and things have been going downhill since After having kidney stones and the doctor could not see them on Xrays because of impaction in my intestines my urologist suggested Miralax I had taken Ducolax two different types of laxatives but was made sick each time because both produced violent reactions but both worked well Miralax was the answer A miracle
1942,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,6,41395,57,I have taken Miralax since I was years old due to a medical condition The product does what it should but after about years it acquired a flavor that I cant stand I mix it with other drinks and over time it ruins those drinks for me also If you can get past the flavor it is a miracle product
1943,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,9,41354,8,Worked perfectly after drinking Liters oz every minutes liters the night before and liters the day of finishing hours before the procedure No side effects at all I suggest quotchasingquot with white cranberry juice This prevented any after taste and possible nausea Taste is the only reason I gave it a nine but it really wasnut bad when chilled Note that if you let the liquid get really cold you wonut be able to drink it fast
1944,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41347,15,I have been having serious issue with my bowels the past few months due to new medications narcotic I have increased fiber water intake exercise laxative use and NOTHING was working I hadnt had a Bowel Motion in weeks Finally I got so fed up with feeling so lousy I went to my primary She had prescribed me Miralax So when I got home I mixed myself a cup of apple juice and pour some Miralax in it hours later I was already starting the process for bowel elimination At first it was still very minimal and still felt completely full By morning time it was a completely different story This is absolutely AMAZING Ive never had a product work so fast and effectively even without cramps Im still mind boggled
1946,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41311,55,Ive been taking MiraLax as my mom tells me ever since I switched to formula Im not a good eater so Im always constipated However MiraLax works pretty much all the time It would get a except that it failed today I took my usual dosage and I was still constipated I guess its because Ive been taking it my entire life

1948,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41267,121,Miralax is great First day was the only time I experienced any side effects and that was only a headache After that Ive been taking it every day at night in a glass of water It doesnt taste like anything and dissolves quickly Works great too Ive always had constipation but recently I was having constant pain and bleeding with every bowel movement due to a fissure it was horrible But now that my doctor recommended Miralax to me I finally feel normal in that department
1950,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41174,119,I have used everything on the market even changing my diet more water and fiber and I was still struggling I saw Miralax at first I thought na just more bad tasting powder I decided to buy it what could I lose I am amazed I feel so much better an no nasty taste I put it in my coffee orange juice even soda So easy to use Thank you for making it over the counter now

1953,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41085,44,I havent use the bathroom like I supposed to in the last month I have taken Fleet and other laxatives but it just did not work I felt so bloated and I never stopped eating Finally I couldnt take it no more so I went the doctor and she prescribed me something to take The medicine that she prescribed for me wasnt covered by my insurance so I went to Walmart and saw that ClearLax had almost the same ingredients I bought me some apple juice and mixed it together About an hour later I really used the bathroom and I feel great If it works for me it is some good stuff and I am serious
1954,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41045,124,I had been constipated for as long as I could remember I would have a bowel motion maybe once every weeks So not normal My diet consisted of high fiber oz of water a day fruits veggies but still no bowel motion I have tried cleansers laxatives and other products but nothing I recently began doing colonic irrigations because I was so frustrated My doc suggested I try Miralax The st day I took some in the morning and the nd day I took some more By that evening of the nd day I had a bowel motion I couldnt believe it After all this time it was Miralax that did the job Thanks Miralax I would recommend this to anyone
1956,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41007,36,Works well for constipation due to Venlafaxine ER I take Miralax every night at bedtime in hot tea after typical day of drinking L water eating an extremely highfiber diet veg except for fish exclusively whole grains cook with extravirgin olive oil and some walking along with lots of tea both green and black The Miralax helps but still only movement per day versus prior to medication When I double the Miralax THEN things start to approach premedication regularity
1957,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,10,40981,109,I recently had a laparoscopic hysterectomy As some of you may know anesthesia from surgery can cause the bowels to basically just stop moving Add to this the trauma of surgery in a nearby region combined with taking narcotics and I was MISERABLE It took days for it to work but when it did it was a major miracle I did not realize constipation could be so bad youd consider that you might DIE Miralax not only works but it does not give you the horrible sick cramps you get with stimulant laxatives Just the best ever
1958,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40965,59,I am years old and was taking an antiinflammatory medicine as well as a prescription pain killer for my kidney stone that I have Those medicines made me constipated and while I was at Childrens ER my nurse practitioner prescribed me MiraLax I was skeptical and afraid that it would counteract with my other medications She assured me that it would be okay Did you know you dont have to take it just once a day I took doses at once with ounces of water and a couple of hours later I finally had a bowel movement Overall this medication is really phenomenal The only bad thing about it is that it causes gas and nausea Other than that Id say this is the best constipation reliever for all ages out there
1960,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40913,56,I had been struggling with constipation since I was from taking Tylenol s for pain and had tried every laxative imaginable I even tried colon hydrotherapy and that did nothing for me I am now and have been taking Miralax for the past month and I have never felt better It feels great to be regular again Prior to Miralax I was going once a week

1971,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,1,40849,40,With my family history of colon cancer and my bout with colon cancer Ive been getting a colonoscopy every years This past April I was told to use Miralax It was the first time my prep was not sufficient to proceed with the procedure even though I followed the instructions exactly
1972,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40776,37,I have been using Clearlax for months as I take many medications everyday that constipate me I have not had any problems and continue to take everyday with no problems
1973,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,6,40746,21,My constipation worries all started when I was taking cholesterol medicines a few months ago and could no longer tolerate side effects on top of the constipation had to stop taking them when I saw my doctor she told me to get some calcium citrate supplement with magnesium to release the constipation Well it only made things worse by giving me bloatinggas I believe that Miralax could possibly save me from all this misery but it just started taking its effect on the third day with some relief with this product but not quite as yet I have an appointment on the seventh day of this product to see if it will actually work out for my problem Also taking simethicone chews mg with Miralax for releasing the fullness gas bloat after meals
1974,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40725,65,I am years old and have had problems with bowel movements since Ive been potty trained Ive usually had one extreme to the other but going to the bathroom was never easy for me I finally went to see my doctor to see if there was anything we could do about this Throughout my childhood Ive been on different medications but nothing helped Now finding out Im lactose intolerant doesnt help either She prescribed me Miralax and I have to say when I use it correctly that is taking it everyday and drinking enough liquids with it it works wonders I no longer get stomach cramps or gas
1975,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,10,40707,142,I had been suffering from severe constipation that couldnt be cured even with laxatives for weeks until my doctor recommended Miralax I took it with no real progress for days but on the th day I finally started having normal bowel movements I did not experience any side effects whatsoever as you do with laxatives No diarrhea gas bloating sudden urgency etc I finally had complete relief Also I mixed Miralax with cranberry juice It had virtually no taste and dissolves completely I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from constipation
1977,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40645,104,This medication is heaven sent We suffer from bad constipation in my family We eat healthy and a very high fiber diet get plenty of exercise and drink lots of water and still get constipated Miralax is our solution for this problem it is even gentle enough for my kidsI do not recommend taking it daily because you could get very loose stools You could take it two days in a row to empty out and then switch to every other day or even every two days This works for me and I have really bad constipation
1979,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40611,2,As I aged my bowel motions became increasingly difficult The physicians I consulted recommended more water dietary fiber exercise etc but none had a lasting effect I tried synthetic glucose derivatives lots and lots of gas and cramps For me dietary fiber produced too much uncontrolled gas The osmotic agents produced too much water loss and I was warned about potential electrolyte imbalance Finally I tried PEG and Nirvana Its convenient tasteless dissolves in all liquids stable and for me no apparent side effects I discovered if I titrate the dose I control the nature of my bowel motion As an OTC product it seems to be one of those rare preparations that wont put me in the hospital
1981,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40544,69,My constipation caused a rectal fissure The tear would reopen every time I had a bowel movement Id been on various stool softeners and laxatives trying to heal the fissure but nothing worked until I started on Miralax Now the fissure is healed and I am pain free So very thankful Just wondering why I had to go to a colon specialist before I found out about this product Why didnt the other doctor I went to suggest this product
1982,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,8,40504,23,Well it works However I put it in water once and there was a bad taste and smell to it Maybe I hadnt mixed it well When I put it in water it was my first time I mixed it until it was clear but oh well It had a somewhat metallic taste reminded me of cauliflower I suggest taking it in like juice or soda

1985,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40256,87,I have constipation due to irritable bowel syndrome After using many other laxatives that helped for awhile Miralax Restoralax in Canada is the only one that has helped me have a regular bowel movement every morning without cramps gas and bloating Ive been using it for about weeks with no side effects I take Restoralax every midafternoon and drink lots of water all day
1986,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40186,55,If you have trouble with chronic constipation Your using Konsyl and things are better bulk wise but still way to hard than Miralax is wonderful Keep adjusting the amount and you will be a much happier camper

1993,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,39983,143,After experiencing constipation for several days I woke up one morning with a physical problem that I was certain would require not only medical attention but also surgical removal Even though my doctor assured me I would be okay I was still skeptical He advised that I should take Miralax every hours until I have a quotcleansing bowel movementquot After my second dose I had success Now I take dose every other night I highly recommend this product
1998,Eslicarbazepine,Seizures,9,42648,5,I have stroke induced epilepsy Many of the medications controlled the seizures in the required dosages but the side effects on my stroke side frequently left me nearly nonfunctionalI was when my neurologist suggested Aptiom as an addon to Lactimal The combo still has side effects relating to aphasia and balance but with consistent effort I function really well Irsquove been taking Lactimal mgAptiom mg and am still seizurefree after monthsIm on Medicare think quotdoughnut holequot and do not qualify for additional assistance
1999,Eslicarbazepine,Seizures,1,42614,6,I was placed on this medication due to my epilepsy At first I didnt notice anything huge other than I was stuttering more and quotlosing wordsquot Then the intense dizziness and vertigo was hitting me every day Id randomly feel like I was under water and someone was spinning me Once I made sure my balance was ok I would have a very difficult time with my thought processes or communicating This would last a while after the dizzy incidents I was only on mg once a day After I spoke with my neurologist they stated that other patients on this medication have been reporting the same things I was removed from it immediately That was about a month and a half ago The dizzy spells STILL happen a couple times a week

2294,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,41717,82,Am yr old female have Type diabetes Was on metformin for years with good control then developed stomach problems nausea Have a new Endocrinologist and he recommended metformin ER and after two days I no longer experience the stomach upset Overall very happy with the medication
2295,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,41707,128,Since my last child years ago my body has been all out of whack piling on the weight late periods or none at all for months on end no matter how much I dieted and exercised the weight would not come off My doctor diagnosed me with depression at first and took bloods to find out I had polycystic ovarian syndrome I have been prescribed two mg doses a day of metformin and at first had quite a bad stomach upset for approximately the first weeks I am now rolling into my th week and feel great The weights slowly coming off and the side effects are non existent now Hoping to conceive a child soon if things go to plan
2296,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,41707,68,I have been taking mg Metformin ER once per day for weeks now Experienced barely any side effects about from a little nausea for days but nothing more after that for anyone experiencing nausea my gyno really emphasised to take it with a meal to stop you from feeling that way I feel great while taking it and have lost kilos already with moderate exercise I havent had a period in days But have been feeling some cramps the last few days so hopefully the metformin will begin to regulate my crazy cycles
2297,Metformin,min,9,41665,139,So far I have been on Glucophage for weeks for Insulin Resistance due to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome I had a little nausea and diarrhea the first two days By day three or four I had no more negative side effects It worked very quickly I quickly began to lose weight and started menstruating again My skin also began to clear up within the first week Glucophage helps so many of the terrible issues caused by PCOS I need more time to better evaluate the medicine but so far it is like a miracle If it is taken with food the side effects are negligible
2298,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,10,41658,107,I started taking this medication about months ago because Im prediabetic I had no side effects amp has worked great
2299,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,8,41580,79,Metformin they say makes you hyperfertile Yea I agree My hormones got a little wacky for a week or so Ive calmed down now and feel pretty good I take the dose up slow only one mg pill for seven days before adding one more mg for another seven and so forth until I reach four pills a day I noticed that without using any lantus that my blood sugar readings were lower Not low enough however to discontinue the lantus I noticed while on lantus alone I never felt all that chipper When I started the metformin my moods improved dramatically and I became a much happier person The diarrhea did not last long but did return when I increased the dose Getting used to the pils nowl and bowels returned to normal
2300,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,4,41563,80,I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome years ago My experience has been horrible Very irregular cycles Ranging from massive bloat extreme flow severe cramps night sweats and facial hair I maybe have periods every years Finally my doctor put me on Metformin The side effects for me are pretty bad Mainly stomach pain and diarrhea I work through it because I know my body will adjust Ive heard great things about this medicine and Im willing go through a little discomfort to improve my irregular cycle
2301,Metformin,emale Infertility,6,41538,30,I must be the small percentage who seems to suffer all side effects I have had the diarrhea sweats insomnia stomach pain weight loss and the list goes on Im on pills per day and have to find a way to work myself up to pills a day I suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis and am hoping this will help with that and my infertility
2302,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,41521,86,After months of taking the extended release metformin my cycle started and had being on point for the past months My acne has begun to clear and I feel better Now begins my diet and exercise to drop excess weight Unfortunately for my hair what has grown out will not go away but I was also given spironolactone to prevent any more from growing until then waxing and plucking will work Hope my review helped
2303,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,41485,74,It has been helpful with my sugar but I sweat most of time This may be a side effect and I am dizzy at times
2304,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,40959,23,Metformin started off good for me Except for the frequent diarrhea it worked quickly to give me a normal period I had no weight loss though I really need it and after months my periods became irregular again My doctor increased my dose after six months and again after Im still not regularly regular and it hasnt increased my ovulation per a daily ovulation test This medicine has generally great reviews but its very inconsistent for me
2307,Metformin,min,9,40935,65,It works very well and there are few side effects My blood sugar will get low but it does not drop like insulin can do I watch what I eat and maintain exercise and my numbers are always good I recommend this medication
2308,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,4,40885,51,I was put on metformin in April when I was diagnosed with diabetes First I was taking x mg once a day with evening meal Now December I am taking x mg twice daily The main side effect has been horrible diarrhea throughout So I am regularly taking Imodium to cope with it My AC has gone down So for me it is a toss up yes blood sugar has gone down but now I have to take diarrhea medicine plus use diaper rash ointment I would like to try something else so my butt could heal
2310,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40864,72,I have only been on Metformin days and I already see the difference in my symptoms I have more energy and already lost lbs Before it took me a year to lose lbs I have mild gastrointestinal discomfort but well worth it It seems to help with food cravings I used to drink cups of coffee in the morning and I am down to only one without any caffeine withdrawal symptoms I also dont crave sugar or high carb foods I have a healthy snack in between meals to prevent blood sugar drops such as an apple berries or carrots I would recommend this to anyone suffering from PCOS
2312,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40850,48,I was diagnosed with PCOS weeks ago and have been on Metformin ever since So far I havent lost any weight Luckily my condition was caught before I gained too much I only have about lbs to lose I am a registered dietitian and exercise daily so the not losing weight is a bit discouraging but my Endocrinologist has assured me that I will apparently with some people it can take up to months to start losing The side effects were horrible the first two weeks along with horrible cramping and a constant period for weeks However now I have no side effects at all you just have to stick with it My doctor was great and recommended taking the metformin at night so that I would be at home for the side effects I take mg daily
2313,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,7,40818,57,I have just been diagnosed with having Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Before the diagnosis I put on about lbs just out of the blue within months I also had excess hair on my face stomach and legs and I only had about periods in the last year I went for a pelvic scan and for the last days I have been taking Metformin mg twice a day under the doctors orders Something is definitely happening because I had a period within days of taking the medication and Ive lost about lbs in the last week The side effects were annoying I had a lot of gas and diarrhea for about days The side effects seem to have passed now My overall experience with Metformin is fairly good so far I am looking forward to seeing more results
2314,Metformin,min,10,40813,66,This medicine has definitely improved my quality of life Within the first weeks of starting metformin I lost pounds where before I struggled to lose weight Now I am in a healthy BMI for my height group I experienced no nausea while taking this medicine I took it in the middle of a meal I did experience some intestinal side effects gas diarrhea for the first week and the first week I increased my dose
2315,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,40810,45,The only issue with this medication for me was the stomach upset gas and diarrhea However the positives totally outweigh the negatives After months with no period and working out days a week with no weight loss it took weeks on mgday of metformin to have a period and lose lbs I noticed that the stomach upset is worst when I eat something heavy or fatty I continue to work out and am anxious to see where I will be a year from now
2316,Metformin,min,10,40794,83,Did failed IVF and months on this and got pregnant naturally
2318,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,7,40758,118,I have been taking this medication for years now It has lowered my insulin levels but they still arent normal I have lost pounds and my menstrual cycles has returned to normal I went almost a year without one at all I also have hypothyroidism and I think my positive results are from it I take two mg pills twice a day I have to eat with it or else I will get sick
2319,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,4,40728,24,I was on Avandamet for years but the weakness tiredness and especially the diarrhea came to be too much to bear If I wanted to go someplace I had to stop medicating I had to take one pill twice a day which resulted in bouts of diarrhea per pill My blood sugars were well within range and I have found nothing since to bring them down to that level but I refuse to be bound by side effects any longer
2321,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,1,40649,44,Im male and a Type diabetic now on insulin I have been a diabetic for years and took glipizide for eight of those years to successfully control my glucose levels When my PCP moved away I had to find a new one My new PCP switched me from glipizide to metformin As much as I tried to carefully titrate on to the medicine metformin left me feeling bloated and with chronic diarrhea My body simply would not tolerate metformin I ended up seeing an endocrinologist and he switched me to insulin and I am VERY happy with that move My glucose levels are under control and I dont have to deal with any adverse effects The penneedle injections hurt less than a finger prick so going on insulin has not been a problem at all
2322,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,3,40627,11,I have been diagnosed with PCOS for over years but only have been prescribed Metformin after seeing no results with combined pills Having gained so much weight over the past year now weighing kgs this medication does not seem to be working at all with my weight loss Im on x mg a day Have had few bad side effects nausea and bad breath I brush my teeth endlessly but doesnt seem to improve As long as I can lose weight I dont mind the side effects but Ive been on this medication for over a month now and I have not lost any weight
2323,Metformin,min,8,40607,36,After a few weeks of taking this my blood sugars came right down and have stayed low
2325,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40532,57,I was originally started on Metformin two years agowhen I first started I was supposed to take mg twice a day then gradually up to three times a day No matter when I took it I got horribly sick to where I missed work and could not even leave the house After stopping the metformin I tried other medications and things got worse After reading some reviews I started taking Metformin extended release I have been taking it for about three weeks and have had no stomach issues If you have a sensitive stomach I highly suggest asking about the extended release I take it at night with dinner and I am fine Hope this helps
2326,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,40487,22,I have had a hard time adjusting to it I have been taking it for about two months mg twice a day I am always tired and if I dont sleep enough I am sick all day I am hungry all day but almost everything nauseates me and I get discomfort pains in my lower stomach I usually can handle the pain and discomfort but since weve been trying to conceive for five years all the symptoms similar to pregnancy plays games with my mind Aside from all that I still plan to take the medicine for as long as it takes If anyone has the symptoms similar to mine please let me know anything you are doing to make it easier Thank you
2328,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,7,40445,6,Ive been on this for almost a month now Im exhausted all the time and whether I take it with food or not I get sick I am supposed to take pills a day I take the morning one about an hour after my workout and the night time one right before bed Ive noticed Im not nauseated when I wake up My period is due in days so well see if I get it No weight loss yet
2329,Clobex,Dermatitis,10,40093,23,Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis I was prescribed Clobex lotion for my condition that arises occasionally and causes itching and burning mostly on my arms Whenever I get a flareup I apply Clobex and get immediate relief
2330,Clobex,Psoriasis,5,40077,39,I have had psoriasis for years and have treated it with cortisone to control the inflammations and itching I discovered Clobex about a year ago and used it on my elbows and scalp It does a great job in eliminating the external signs of psoriasis when used for to weeks However after about a month the symptoms return I have used it a second and third time with the same results but I am hesitant to continue this process considering the warnings provided
2331,Clobex,Atopic Dermatitis,9,40060,40,I have tried really almost every corticosteroid medication on the market including topical triamcinolone and oral prednisone However this product is by far the most effective because it immediately reduces the swelling and inflammations caused by my skin disorder and disinfects the affected area It also doesnt cause the weight gain and mood swings of prednisone so its considerably safer and milderThe only unfortunate parts of this medication are that it can be quite greasy causing mild discomfort and can cause stinging when applied especially if the wound is new I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with their dermatological problem
2332,Clobex,Psoriasis,6,39891,116,I have had moderate and sometimes severe plaque and guttate psoriasis for years using clobetasol clobex for Clobex is the only thing that can eliminate my psoriasis almost completely It is a very effective drug but I feel I really should warn people of the devastating effects that can occur if the drug is applied continuously When using clobex or any other strong topical corticosteroid you are supposed to use it for no more than weeks then take a break I believe should be between and weeks I made the mistake of not doing that I used it continuously because I wanted to be clear Now my skin is paper thin Nearly every vein is visible and I break blood vessels constantly and I have stretch marks everywhere
2333,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,39631,40,I got psoriasis in March after a strep infection I probably had spots on my legs a few spots on my scalp and arms and chest but my legs were horrible My doctor gave me some samples of Clobex spray and after week my Psoriasis is gone He said I need to go in a mega tan bed for minutes and take IU of Vitamin D and take zinc so doing all that I am so thrilled with the results I would recommend Clobex to anyone pricey but so worth it
2334,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,39567,18,After a very bad breakout from a strep infection this was the only thing that stopped the itch After using this twice a day for a week along with UV treatments I started seeing my psoriasis clear up And the spray is so much easier to apply
2335,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,39526,33,AMAZINGWithin days I could see a difference in my skinThe plaques were starting to fadethe redness and itchiness GONEIt has been exactly one week since I started using the spray and I no longer have psoriasis
2338,Clobex,Psoriasis,9,43075,1,I used Clobex spray this summer for weeks in June This gave me almost immediate clear skin on my elbows This lasted until September long sleeve season Thanks Clobex I plan on using this every summer to give me clear skin during short sleeve weather Hopefully some day they find a permanent cure for this disease
2339,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42818,2,Clobex is in shampoo form I use that weekly Need tsp Lathers up really well I leave the shampoo on for a few hours then rinse This is a great maintenance first me between the spray applications I apply the spray on wet hairscalp so it stretches the product more bc its expensive
2341,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42538,9,Ive tried almost everything for psoriasis in the past It was an extremely embarrassing time in my life I was at the point that I was going to ask the doctor if he could just surgically remove the areas Then I tried clobex spray Within weeks it was completely gone Being a nurse Ive run across alot of patients that I have suggested them to try this spray They have all had success and come back to thank me I even tried it on my poison ivy and it worked wonders Thank you to the makers of Clobex You have changed my life Forever grateful
2342,Clobex,Eczema,10,42466,8,As most other users comment I call Clobex Spray my wonder drug at its worst my eczema results in the skin on my hands fingers covered in open weeping sores so that I have to wear cotton gloves constantly Clobex Spray clears this condition in or days But the main point of my review last time I bought Clobex it cost me a bottle this means I could rarely afford to use it I went to a different dermatologist he prescribed Clobex for supply through a specific mail order pharmacy the cost with no insurance coverage was I dont imagine I can name the pharmacy here but PLEASE if this stuff works for you get your dermatologist to do his job to find you a pharmacy where you can actually afford to buy it
2343,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42303,39,I would use clobex on my thick plaque psoriasis on my scalp It literally cleared it up completely within hrs to the point where I can go and get my hair cut The best med Ive used in my years of trying everything
2344,Clobex,Lichen Sclerosus,10,42302,15,Ive used Clobetasol Propinate for several years now I have to use the ointment the creme burns when I apply it But it heals the cracks and itching and bleeding I get from my outbreaks
2345,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42088,24,The spray is amazingonly thing that will clear my scalpRight now my scalp is in a mess because my insurance will not pay on it and it is for a oz bottleI cant afford that
2346,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42025,38,Clobex for my skin I cant say enough good things about this spray I say quotsprayquot because the ointment did nothing The spray for some reason is absolutely amazing One place on my knee where the P wasnt removable with a jackhammer magically cleared up of the area in less than week My arms my chest EVERYTHING its gone My Psoriasis is gone Ive gone through shampoos NOW if I stop using the spray for a week or longer the symptoms return but until a cure is found for Psoriasis this medication is handsdown the absolute best there is
2348,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,41761,39,After about a year with this I went to see a doctor amp I was just diagnosed with pustular psoriasis palms of hands and bottom of feet only Before seeing a doctor I started juicing heavily lbs no thats not a typo of carrots in three weeks amp added green juices to my regimen as well My hands had completely cleared and my feet were almost completely clear But because of another issue I went to my doctor and because of the then upcoming tests I backed off of my juicing completely The psoriasis came back on my hands and feet While I wasnt juicing I figured I would find out what it was Doc gave me the Clobex spray For the immediate painful inflammation problems in my feet caused by the psoriasis this stuff is AWESOME
2351,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,41593,22,I love this stuff I actually use a different medication for my body called Stelara and I love that product as well But this is a good back up for special occasions when I want to let my hair down I spray several days before the event and I am almost clear I spray before bed and sleep with it in my hair and then around noonish I wash my hair Also dont wear nail polish while applying It will be like nail polish remover Great product
2352,Clobex,Dermatitis,10,41579,18,After just days of using this Im starting to see significant clearing on the inside of my elbow where a stress rash got out of control I might not need to even use it for the whole weeks and be able to save it for next time
2353,Clobex,Lichen Planus,10,41466,32,This is the only medication that worked after trying others for several months
2355,Clobex,Psoriasis,9,40997,30,Clobex is the only thing that worked Severe patches and redness went away in only days Its expensive and is a very strong medicine a little goes a long way
2356,Clobex,Psoriasis,8,40934,26,Had good redults form Clobex However after two years of using it my skin is starting to thin so I can not use it no more
2357,Clobex,Psoriasis,3,40463,43,I used Clobex this summer for itching and dry flakes in my scalp I became sick with a bad cold and later turned to pneumonia I was sick all summer long with trouble breathing and wheezing I went to an ENT and a lung doctor None of us could figure out what was causing the lung problem After several months I was getting better with the breathing problems Last week I used Clobex again because the itching scalp came back Two days later I am having breathing problems I put and together read the side effects of Clobex and breathing problems and wheezing are the first side effects listed All that suffering because I did not read the medical bulletins earlier
2361,Clobex,Atopic Dermatitis,10,40149,15,Works exceptionally well on body and scalp The only problem is it is outrageously expensive I had to go with the generic form
2362,Clobex,Psoriasis,9,40110,26,I had a severe case of psoriasis at the base and outer areas of my hair line with severe itching and the Clobex lotion cleared it up in a week I used a little on the affected area only
2363,Metformin,min,8,39793,141,This drug helped me control my eating habits and lowered my weight However I developed constipation
2364,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,39781,80,I have had PCOS all my life I am and had to have a full hysterectomy in May I was told by my male doctor that having a complete hysterectomy would relieve me of my PCOS symptoms It didnt Ladies we are still symptomatic of PCOS even with a full hysterectomy I have since found a female doctor who is a specialist with PCOS cases and has me on all the right hormone replacement therapy as well as the Metformin I take pills a day and it is helping tremendously I am losing weight and feeling better I do get a bit tired as I adjust to the higher dosing However I have never felt better in my life I would strongly advice seeing a female doctor for the PCOS issue at any age Women just understand women plain and simple
2365,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,39752,35,I have been having issues since I first got my period at years old Ive had horrible weight gain infertility and my cycles is never the same twice Ive been on Metformin for almost a month now and just had my first quotnormalquot cycle I had a bit of a problem with nausea when I first started taking this and Ive learned I have to eat right away when I get up from feeling sick but am getting used to it I definitely have to take this medicine with food or I get sick
2366,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,39752,39,For over years my doctor had no clue what was wrong with me So he just kept telling me to take birth control to regulate I was finally diagnosed with PCOS about years ago and was prescribed Metformin It has helped so much I did have a few side effects for about the first few weeks Nausea and tiredness mainly but it wasnt that bad I feel better and I have lost quite a bit of weight
2369,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,39708,17,I have recently began treatment for PCOS with metformin and i love the fact that I am now able to lose weight with medication and am watching what I eat I have not yet had any side effects I go back to the doctor soon to have more blood work hope it is working well
2372,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,39645,11,I was prescribed Metformin in combination with Clomid not sure if its working yet It has upset my stomach whether I take it with food or not Other than that I havent experienced any side effects
2373,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,7,39640,4,Ive taken this medication a couple times in my life and have had no adverse reactions
2374,Metformin,min,8,39614,76,Have been suffering for years before someone decided to treat me Glucophage plus a birth control has made life better
2375,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,39569,50,I am taking metformin to control my PCOS It works really well The pill is medium sized and doesnt upset my stomach if I take it with food
2376,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,39541,143,i find this medicine to work pretty well throughout the day but not so much over night the down side is that it upsets my stomach a lot of the times
2377,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,39520,167,I have found this medicine for type to work extremely well I have had to use many other meds for my type diabetes and found myself on one heck of a roller coaster ride with high and low and no middle ground This particular med is great for me and it helps keep my appetite in control The apeptite issue is from another med that I will not mention
2378,Dalmane,Insomnia,9,42895,5,CORE Med for sleep This combo works for me amp Ive tried everything Dalmane mg Gabapentin mg amp mg Remeron VERY careful re Weight Gain Side Effect gained lbs in short order dramatically increases your appetite for Carbs amp Sugars amp overall appetite what they dont tell you is that they give this to patients in the hospital who wont eat to increase their appetite Dalmane can cause next day drowsiness but it disappears after a week or two
2379,Dalmane,Insomnia,1,42666,11,Yes dalmane is very effective at putting and keeping you asleep I was prescribed it for four years before the dangers were known By blocking neuron transmissions mine were not communicating next day I had a career that required thought concentration and problem solving I no longer could do any of that My professional domestic social and economic life fell apart insidiously over that time I became agoraphobic and withdrawn dependent on others who told me what to do Recovery of my own mind took well over five years many of them in a spin I had been made very very ill indeed
2380,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,42141,15,I have taken Dalmane mg since I had breast cancer in Worked great getting to sleep and staying asleep I continued using it since I had several surgeries in the past years This year I wanted to stop taking it I didnt know after weeks you are hooked on them they are that addictiveIt took me almost months to ween myself off them with my doctors help Dropping the dose and using Benadryl on that night until I wasnt using them anymore I would try another med if I never they were do had to stop
2381,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,42141,9,I have taken Dalmane mg since I had breast cancer in Worked great getting to sleep and staying asleep I continued using it since I had several surgeries in the past years This year I wanted to stop taking it I didnt know after weeks you are tooked on them they are that addictiveIt took me almost months to ween myself off them with my doctors help Dropping a night use every two weeks and using Benadryl on that night until I wasnt using them anymore I would try another med if I never they were do had to stop
2383,Dalmane,Insomnia,9,41484,54,Dalmane is a good medicine for insomnia because it works quickly and lasts a long time Due to its long half life it also gives anxiety relief for the next day I also notice I can go to bed easier the next night without taking another dose It does leave a metallic taste in the mouth and can build a tolerance but as long as you are careful it can give restorative sleep Also because it is so old this medicine is cheap for those of us paying with cash I wouldnt recommend it longterm because of the consequences involved with longterm benzodiazepine use but this is a sleeping pill that current manufacturers cant match
2384,Dalmane,Insomnia,8,40908,61,With all benzodiazepines you tend to build a tolerance which is why it is only recommended for short term insomnia treatment or to be taken as needed I do have to say that when used as needed this medicine hit me like a mac truck and I would sleep hours plus My anxiety and insomnia both much improved No hallucinations or late night grazing like with those so called quotnonaddictivequot quotnonnarcoticquot sleep aids Word of advice Make sure you take if you can sleep for at least hours and set multiple alarms
2386,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,40282,61,I had a hysterectomy and was suffering from no sleep at all My doctor gave me Ambien and it did work for the first few nights then sleepless nights returned A few days ago he gave me Dalmane and I couldnt be happier I am sleeping all night now However I do have a slight headache in the morning
2388,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,39949,123,I had chronic insomnia and the Doctor tried Ambien Lunesta and some other hypnotic which the name escapes me right now Those drugs for me anyway are worthless I would get up in morning and find a mess in kitchen I live alone and no memory of fixing food Furthermore began having terrible dreamsnightmares So Doctor tried me on Dalmane he said it has been on market for many years It worked great No hangover Slept hours straight for first time in months
2391,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,40350,33,I am and have suffered for about years from extreme tiredness acne around the mouth and chin and weight gain Was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in Started taking Metformin weeks ago and have had little side effects I am also taking spironolactone My biggest complaint is severe sudden cramping in the small muscles in the front of my legs and toes Taking calcium with magnesium seem to help I felt tired for several days but have lost lbs already Could also be from water weight My brain seems less foggy and I dont feel as depressedI do not eat sweets in general but this medication has affected my appetite in a good way
2392,Metformin,min,1,40260,51,I took this medicine for a very short while It began with serious nausea followed by vomiting a couple of weeks later I could not take this medicine
2393,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,40243,28,After one year on my medication I find it to cause serious fatigue if I have not eaten regularly Gas and bloating are on and off Minor weight reduction Initially it was a wonder drug with the usual gas and loose stool over time its positive effects are less noticeable unless I miss a dose
2394,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,40241,20,Taking metformin twice daily for nine days now st time user horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea first days but clearing up now sleeping hours every other day and feeling tired in evening not in morning Nauseous when eating anything in evening headaches in evening also Seeing drop in glucose readings of about points fasting at this time some weight loss probably from fluid loss and not eating much in evenings
2398,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,40170,29,I started to take Metformin two months ago after finally recieving proper treatment for PCOS and insulin resistance The first month was especially rough gas abdominal cramps and diarrhea were persistent It seemed my body was used to my blood sugar being high so if I didnt watch meal times I ended up having minor symptoms of hypoglycemia even though my blood sugar was normal finally On rough days I would take an Imodium with my metformin careful not to overtake it I stopped eating crap it made me sick and I found that if I took it an hour or two before or after meals instead of with the meal my GI side effects werent as bad Drink lots of water
2401,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,40126,108,I have been using Metformin for months to aggressively treat my prediabetic condition Together with a lowercarb mg per day calories I have lost pounds This is about double the weight loss rate I had on the diet alone The only side effect I have experienced is a loose stool once or twice a week Definitely a good tradeoff I am a year old female moderately active who has had a hysterectomy
2402,Metformin,min,10,40123,164,My experience with metformin has been awesome I have been using this medicine for about a year now and have has great results I know have regular periods which is great because I used to get it every days or miss months here and there Another fantastic thing is that I can now function when I am menstruating which used to be impossible for me due to the horrible pain I now have manageable pain and dont have to get shots for it Ive also been able to lose lbs that I had gained Overall Ive had a wonderful experience with this medication I believe that taking my doctors advice was the best thing I ever did I think the combination of the medicine changed eating habits and exercise all helped
2403,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,40122,26,I have been on metformin for about months and I take it to help me lose weight and I do see results but now I feel tired a lot but that is about all
2404,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,3,40114,21,Helped me with my blood sugar levels and I lost lbs in a month Down side horrible stomach pain nausea and diarrhea Doctor is changing my medicines
2405,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,5,40101,13,I am currently on Metformin for PCOS symptoms However blood test after blood test has shown that I do not have PCOS I have all the symptoms and Metformin is working to regulate my cycles The only downside is the weakness lightheadedness and sleepiness I am experiencing I have read that it is possibly from lactic acidosis which is frightening I am increasing my water intake and exercise and hoping that it will go away
2406,Metformin,min,2,40098,71,I was on this medication for about a year and I had horrible side effects
2407,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40085,15,I just got this medicine prescribed to me on Friday started taking it on Saturday no side effects yet but from reading the comments it seems to help with PCOS and regulating your periodgetting a biopsy in weeks to see if I am precancerous or have cancer so wish me luck
2408,Metformin,min,8,40081,14,The first week of taking Metformin Glucophage I was extremely sick But after that intail first week of taking the pill I was better I take mg in the morning and at night making that mg a day So far it hasnt given me any issues Havent noticed much weight loss but so far I am happy with it
2410,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,40048,21,Since I started to take this medicine my sugar level has been a lot easier to manage
2411,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,9,40044,32,Just diagnosed last week Taking mg x day Only side effect Ive had is increased anxiety after taking the morning dose Ive had sporadic anxiety episodes in the past but they appear to have increased
2412,Metformin,min,8,40037,55,My doctor recommend glucophage mg twice a day with breakfast and dinner With breakfast also take mg Glocotrol It made my sugar level while previously was as high as
2413,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,40027,30,I have been on it since I was diagnosed in May of Started with x mg and was increased to x mg in months No problems so far
2414,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40022,28,I used metformin for about months and only had nausea and heartburn after a greasy meal this made me change to the Metformin ER It did help me lose about pounds which is great because with PCOS it is hard to lose weight I only used this to lose some weight and make me ovulate which only took about weeks I do not have insulin resistance Overall this is a great drug for PCOS
2415,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40017,50,I was prescribed this about two months ago for PCOS my doctor gave me the option to treat the symptoms or treat the root cause and I choose the latter She started me out on a low dose and worked up to a full dose which helped a lot with side effects I felt mildly nauseous all the time until I started focusing on really eating right If I eat a good healthy dinner right before I take the pills I dont feel sick at all Another side effect Ive lost all interest in alcohol because it makes me feel terrible immediately This has forced me to change my lifestyle but in a good way Ive lost some weight and just generally feel better
2417,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,40016,34,I was on Meformin for about a month mg twice a day I was told that it would give me stomach problems and loose stools but since I have irritable bowel syndrome that didnt worry me As it turns out this medicine had the opposite affect I had constipation all the time Only a good dose of laxatives would help but even then I had to strain pretty hard to relieve myself Finally my doctor decided to take me off the medication since my readings were in the mid s Ive been off for about two days and Im feeling very lightheaded Im hoping this will pass soon My readings are still good and the constipation is abating
2419,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,3,39998,49,I am a year old male I stopped taking this drug along with Glimepiride after only days because I was experiencing constant exhaustion and shortness of breath Walking up the steps caused me to pant and have to sit and rest I wanted to sleep all the time I never took a sugar reading during the days I was taking it so it may very well have worked to lower my sugar I just couldnt live with the side effects and felt better within hours of stopping taking it and Glimepiride I will go back to my doctor after the holiday to try something else
2421,Metformin,min,8,39972,8,Did not resolve polycystic ovarian syndrome completely but did improve quality of life by treating my subclinical insulin resistance Metformin extended release mgday
2422,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,39970,13,I have been taking Metformin for about a month and have not had any side effects I also take glyburide with it
2423,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,6,39966,63,I started this year ago The first day I couldnt leave the bathroom after that it was okay but it gives me gas and cramps really bad and it still does If I eat it goes away No gain or loss in weight on this drug Im not fat I do crave carbohydrates on it though My AC usually is in the sixs most of the time I have it checked every three months I was fighting this disease on my own but for me I gave up after three years because I was very limited to what I could eat I was diagnosed years ago with a starting AC of Got it down to with no medicines but that is when I gave up because the life style is just not conducive to normal life
2424,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,39961,18,So far it seems okay It controls my eating
2425,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,39961,42,First reaction was stomach cramps and diarrhea Things settled down in two days after three weeks now feel very tired
2426,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,8,39948,138,Metformin is helping me drastically in that it controls my insulin resistance First side effects were gas and diarreah and some bad breath but those have gone away I recommend this to anyone who has sugar problems
2427,Metformin,min,10,39941,184,I started glucophage xr on February I can not believe how much better I feel Before glucophage I spent every waking minute thinking about what I would eat next For the last years I stayed under calories a day and my readings were or I was up and down like a yoyo all day and night I gained weight constantly I weighed in at lbs on Feb Now months later on glucophage I have lost lbs and I eat like a normal person I cant believe the difference The first week on it I had some nausea but it went away and I now have no side effects I keep thinking this is a fluke a pill cant make that much of a difference I feel better than I have in years I now have energy because I am eating enough and my readings are amazing
2428,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,39941,30,I was recently diagnosed finally with PCOS I have had irregular periods since I was In the past the only thing that would regulate me was birth control but since my husband and I have been trying for a baby I havent been on birth control for quite some time Just before getting confirmation on the PCOS I was diagnosed with Type diabetes and my family doctor put me on Metformin She said lucky for me pregnancy was a side effect in some cases Im not pregnant yet but I have started getting periods since I started taking it for the first time in years I feel really good about this medication especially after reading everyones comments Thank you all for the great feedback I look forward to the losing weight part too
2429,Metformin,min,6,39940,40,It works great but the downfall of Metformin is it causes you to have diarrhea but it controls my insulin resistance
2432,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,39913,55,I feel like it helps to lower my blood sugar but sometimes the side effects are unbearable I have severe stomach problems I take mg twice a day
2433,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,39898,46,I have just recently been put onto metformin for control of my type diabetes I have been told it shall help not only with my blood levels but aid me in weight loss
2434,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,39891,48,I have been using Metformin for about month and have already seen results Ive lost lbs and have gotten my period on a regular basis PCOS is not fun Ive become very emotional but with the proper medication diet and exercise it makes it a lot easier to cope with
2437,Metformin,min,9,39865,113,I have been taking Glucophage for years I have never had any side effects at all and my blood sugar level is always good
2438,Metformin,min,8,39839,125,I consider Glucophage a successful treatment because it has been prescribed to me for ten years and Ive had no adverse effects at all Aside from favorable bloodsugar results I dont even feel the drug is in my system

2441,Lovaza,Hypertriglyceridemia,10,41041,45,Worked very well Triglicerides went from to in just weeks The only medication that worked for me
2442,Lovaza,Hypertriglyceridemia,1,40745,42,Did not significantly help with my triglycerides Caused severe chest pain and shortness of breath

2462,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,10,42972,0,Uceris has been the best medicine I have tried for my collagenous colitis Everything else did not work or had too many side effects To me this is a miracle medicine They say to take one mg per day but believe it or not that actually made me constipated For me nothing took away the D even when I took seven Imodium a day So I started taking Uceris on a as needed basis It worked out to take one or two a week So for me I rated a with no side effects
2463,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,3,42803,4,I have UC for years I was in remission for a few years and then all of a sudden I had a flare up I have been one this medication for almost months When I first started on it it helped for like a week or so I had swelling in my face and joints and sore muscles and headaches My doctor told me to stick with it so my body could adjust properly and it helped but didnt stop my issues For the last week I have been going to the bathroom times a day Me and my doctor are now trying to figure out the next step
2464,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,9,42792,10,I am now on my second bottle of Uceris It took about weeks before it became effective for my microscopic colitis in other words when my diarrhea stopped completely After becoming effective I experienced side effects first swelling of both ankles that lasted a few days less than a week After that I had no ankle problem at all except for a feeling of pins and needles on both feet which I dont find problematic Second an increase in appetite which I needed as I had lost lb as a result of diarrhea The appetite increase lasted about days Uceris has given me a chance at feeling well and able to live my life

2471,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,8,41817,18,Been using Balsalazide x for years or so with occasional flareups I could resolve with slight overdosing Could not resolve present flare up After a month of bowel motions a day blood diarrhea doc started me on Uceris Next day change to bowel motion no blood slight diarrhea Now wk later pretty normal bowel motion per day with occasional nausea in abdomen I think pretty good for a week But the price is outrageous and even my copay is mo Doc insists on giving it to me for mos

2474,Ethacrynic acid,Edema,8,42240,8,I took this in as a test subject There was an article in Time magazine and they used the phrase wringing out the wet Along with the decrease in what was then called idiopathic edema I have a big decrease in bp winding up with readings of way too low for me I would get this quotstrangequot feeling have just enough time to go uh oh and then have to lay down I felt as tho I would fall if I moved It had all the classic symptoms of a diabetic low the dizziness heavy sweating overall malaise physical weakness However I was not a diabetic then was slim with no sighs of pre diabetes I stopped using it Later I was told it was only used in the hospital for extreme cases of fluid retention Now I see it on this list
2477,Cardizem CD,Atrial Fibrillation,5,41482,50,I was happy with medication as I did not have as many side effect but on day of taking it I developed a rash on my stomach next day chest and lower back third day neck and face It was the only thing I was doing differently so I looked up its side effects Rash was listed and could occur within to days It is a Saturday so as advised online I stopped the medication I hope this a temporary condition and I can begin again or an alternative can be found
2480,Cardizem CD,Atrial Fibrillation,1,40557,48,Been on this for over month AF still happening nearly everyday May last for hours I dont think it does any good Ill see doctor in days Hope he has something else to try
2481,Cardizem CD,Atrial Fibrillation,7,40060,65,I have been on this medicine for two months I have had one attack since I started I do feel a little tired and weak but no other side effects
2482,Cardizem CD,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9,40026,53,I have been on this medication a couple of years for supraventricular tachycardia and hypertension and have not had ONE episode of SVT since being on it I used to get SVT once or twice a month so this medicine has truly made my life better The problem I now face is with my insurance company since they are hiking up nongeneric copays to times as much as before Since there is no generic until I must either forego this medicine and try something else or pay something I cant afford This is frustrating when I know the medicine works
2485,Camrese,Birth Control,5,42621,0,I was excited to try this pill because it would cut down my period to only times a year However the spotting became a huge issue I began spotting during the first pack around the time I would typically get my period I knew this was a side effect but it lasted weeks and became a nuisance I soldiered through the pack and it eventually stopped and I got a very light period months later as scheduled The next pack was worse Again I started spotting after the first month It continued for weeks and turned into the heaviest period Ive ever had and I had to go to my doctor and be put on another pill to stop the bleeding and then switched pills This may work for some but it unfortunately didnt for me
2489,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42591,1,Ive been on camrese for almost a month before I was on lo seasonique which I loved better I switched because I was told it helped better with cramps an lighten your period but omg I been spotting every since I been on it My period was due last week but i just been spotting Im on my last week of pills this week I take my pill every morning on time never miss still spotting smh Im calling my doctor telling him I need to switch back over Its literally like your on your period for a whole month I dont recommend at all
2491,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42585,3,Horrible If I could rate a I would Started having headaches I never ever have headaches got my period for days weeks in bp went from to Missed doses so I followed the directions and upon taking them and my normal dose shit hit the fan I couldnt breathe my heart was racing and my bp went through the roof I was sent to er after my first visits to get checked for a PE have had a million tests done several ekgs and have an spot with a cardiologist I have been waiting for the drugs to get out of my system the half life is about a month and I am light headed have the worst anxiety never ever had it before so it really hard to deal with which is making it worse really jittery and and not happy
2494,Camrese,Birth Control,5,42545,4,I just started using this BC and it has been horrible I was told to just push through it amp that the pain would go away after the first full month I constantly have cramps as if Im starting my period and nauseous every other day Im also starting to develop headaches frequently but not sure if thats directly correlated
2497,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42511,3,Ive been on this birth control for almost years The first month I remember being very hungry all the time but that either stopped or I learned to deal with it I didnt get any other side effects from it The only reason Im not giving it a is because every cycle I start spitting about two weeks before Im supposed to get my period I just end up taking the period pills two weeks early to get it over with and start the next pack My periods have gotten much lighter most days I dont even need a tampon but I get bad cramps on or of the days which I never used to get before BC Over all I would recommend this birth control Although you MUST take it at exactly the same time every day or you will spot earlier
2499,Camrese,Birth Control,8,42493,1,I switched to camrese because my last birth control was giving me consistent debilitating migraines during the week of my period or if I forgot a pill It was too unbearable to experience that every month Im now on my second pack of camresemonth and so far it has been great I enjoy only having to deal with getting my period every months and I havent had a migraine yet Spotting happened for a short while in the beginning but it went away No weight gain I have been feeling more depressed just recently but its hard to know if its the BC or situational Ill be following up with my doctor
2500,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42477,10,This bc is horrible Going into my rd month and I havent stopped bleeding yet So much for the no months
2503,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42430,13,I was on Seasonique for a year or two and then a generic was made available and I switched to Camrese Ive been on Camrese for at least years and it is truly awesome for me But heres my advice to everyone Spotting I spotted occasionally on CamreseSeasonique and yes its normal But what my doctor told me and I have shared with friends experiencing the same is to stop your pill for days Allow the spotting to happen just as if it was a period and then resume your pill Be smart use backup birth control those days I found not always taking at the same time within hours to be the cause of the spotting Ive taken roughly different pills over the past years and Camrese worked best for me But everyone is different
2504,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42430,6,I started with this pill to get off the shot but it is no betterI cant sleep at night I have the worst headaches my cycle is never predictableI can see blood one day and nothing the next I can have sex one day and still bleed amp thats so embarrassing amp disgusting I hate this pill it was the worst choice ever
2505,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42423,8,I have only been taking camrese for weeks and i have been bleeding ever since I was told by my doctor to take it the first day of my period which i did Now usually my periods last days very little cramping if any and usually moderate to light Since taking this i feel like my guts are going to fall out The first few days i started having weird cramps in my upper stomach which felt like contractions when you are going to give birth than when that went away i would get normal cramping which i dont really care about but every other day my bleeding is different One day the bleeding can be very light and feels like its going to stop than later that night or the next i would be gushing to where i have to wear a tampon and a pad
2506,Camrese,Birth Control,5,42421,2,I went on this because I really liked the sound of only periods a year mine are miserable amp heavy I didnt have any spotting on the st pack However on just about every pack since then Ive had anywhere from weeks of spotting Sometimes its just brown discharge other times it warrants a tampon My periods are just as heavy and miserable I also initially had a massive acne flare up when I started Camrese About twice per pack Ill break out badly on my face once during my period and about weeks after that Ill be asking for a different brand at my next visit Been on this for year but hey I didnt get pregnant
2508,Camrese,Birth Control,6,43045,0,I got on birth control for my horrible cramps and to prevent getting pregnant I have had mostly ups but some downs using this birth control you must make sure to take it everyday around the same time because it does effect you when you are supposed to get your period Also I have major mood swings now depression and gained weight with taking this It does help majorly with my cramps and how much I was bleeding
2509,Camrese,Birth Control,10,43016,2,I lost weight and feel a lot less variable emotionally
2510,Camrese,Birth Control,8,42976,4,Been on this for years started about months after dating my boyfriend Occasional spotting but nothing compared to what others have described I am fortunate in that I have always had extremely light periods anyway and there hasnt really been a change except for frequency No weight gain and no acne or hair loss or any of the other things people have unfortunately described The only thing Ive noticed is a significant decrease in libido Like went from to zero within weeks of starting the pill By the time I figured out it wasnt going away I was too hesitant to switch since its the only side effect and any BC is a gamble so I just deal with it
2512,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42976,0,I have a semirare medical condition where I get intense horrendous mood swings due to a horomone imbalance Camrese has been the only birth control for me to solve this Ive taken birth controls that have made me gone into spouts of rage but after taking this for more than six months I can say this is the right medicine for me I have no more mood swings and the period pills have horomones in them so I wont have emotional swings there either I also have PCOS so whatever Its good to know Im still getting some estrogen to counteract the testosterone What is unusual now is that my period is so light that I only need a light pad Im currently days into it and its extremely managable It almost seems too good to be true
2513,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42946,0,Ive been taking this medication for about years now I had chronic migraines for over a year before I started taking this with no explanation as to why I was having such awful headaches every single day ObGyn recommended me on birth control and I havent had a migraine for years now I dont have any bad side affects from this birth control that Ive noticed yet Only having a period times a year is definitely a plus
2514,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42942,3,I am on the rd sheet of pills so about months in before taking i weighed now I am feel depressed just this week started to get brown discharge and thick red blood clots try to take the pill everyday with my coffee but I was an hour off a few times my boobs grew from C to double DD I dont mind but I do feel bloated and have had a couple angry depressed daysnot sure its worth these symptoms but before I had such bad cramps n migraines was in bed every month for days at least Plus I thought only being having early menopause with hot flashes n migraines this would help me not sure yet Staying on for another week or soo see what happens and the weight gain for me is the worst I dont fit in my pants plus need new bras
2516,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42928,1,I have been taking this birth control for about years I originally was taking Lo Seasonique but had to switch to this as it is the generic optionI began taking this in high school after suffering from crippling cramps and missing school due to these symptoms The first three months were full of spotting which I was warned of ahead of time After my first pack my body started to get used to this BCIt is a low dosage of hormones which works great for my body right now One thing I have noticed is that if I dont take my pill at exactly the same time each day I do begin spotting for a day or two There have been a few occasions where I have forgotten or taken it or so hours late which has caused spotting to begin
2517,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42918,6,Ive been on this for about three months now The first month and a half were great No mood swings no spotting or headaches or depression but then I got into my third month and was experiencing breakthrough bleeding a lot and then had several blood clots And I am still having spotting Ive been depressed acne is horrible I have horrible food cravings not to mention awful cramps to where I cant even move I want to continue and try to see if it gets better but I am just having the worst time with this and am miserable that I am over taking this I know for some it has worked and maybe if I stick it out it will get better but I have no interest in continuing with this bc
2518,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42833,4,I have taken Camrese for years now The first few months were difficult as my body adjusted to the new hormones The typical nausea and mood swings However by the th month of taking it I was feeling great I experience no side effects from the pill My libido is high weight gain only lb difference than prepill weight and my periods are more manageable So far pregnancy protection Because I only have a period times a year my life is so much easier No more missing work debilitating cramps or scheduling around periods for travel days and beach fun If you do not mind pushing through the first couple of months of hormonal changes everyone is affected differently then I highly recommend this brand
2519,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42831,1,I have been taking birth control for almost years After switching insurance companies I was also forced to switch birth control I was also placed on the extended cycle birth control to lower the chance of the cysts I just had removed returning This birth control made me have crazy mood swings and feel very depressed I rated it because hey I didnt get pregnant and I dont feel pain indicating my cysts have returned I am approaching my nd month not taking this my skin looks worse than it ever has and I am broken out on my jawline I would never break out there previously My mood however has resumed to its former chipper selfI would not recommend this birth control to anyone
2521,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42816,1,Im weeks into this pill I have PMDD and treat it with other Medication but it makes me sad and depressed even with the other medication The anxiety is through the roof This pill makes me so tired I also have horrible night sweats every night I also cant sleep The insomnia is awful Headaches everyday I have spent the last month trying to figure out what my deal was and its this awful pill I thought I may of had another condition The idea of periods a year is amazing but this pill just isnt worth it I am stopping this pill ASAP and hoping that everything returns to normal in a few days Oh and the fact that I have completely lost my sex drive Yeah that sucks too I just want to sleep and not sweat at night
2523,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42794,3,I was diagnosed with PMDD and it was severe I dreaded my periods every month and there was always one day a month I literally couldnt function Doctors wanted to prescribe Mirena but for many reasons I am against IUDs We tried so many birth controls and I had issues with all of them and they never put a dent in my PMDD Thank goodness for my Dr She explained to me what nobody else explained to me is that all birth controls are different in their levels of hormones some have more estrogen some have more progesterone and I think its even more complex then that anyways Camrese is supposedly as similar to Mirena that you can get in pill form Its been like night and day for me I feel amazing Only complaint is cold sweats
2525,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42774,3,Ive been on camrese for about a year now and its the best birth control Ive had yet All the others I bled for months and had super crazy mood swings The only thing that really sucks about it is that I have NO sex drive But the fact that I only have a period every months makes up for it Every so often ill get some really light bleeding but its not even enough to validate wearing a tampon for
2526,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42754,6,Everything was okay until the end of the first pack Then I spotted for months straight I am now having my period and it is just like how they were before the medicine only with more cramps I usually have awful cramps the first day then they go away Im days in and the cramps havent gotten better I am remaining hopeful for the next month set though
2527,Camrese,Birth Control,8,42737,8,Ive been on the Camrese three month birth control for a total of months now The first three month pack did not go too well which is why I gave it an eight for a rating After the first month I spotted heavy enough to ruin underwear but not enough to use a padtampon up until month three when it was time for my actual period I would have specific periods of sadness as well but no weight gain But I decided to see if it got any better IT DID My second three month pack I did not have any spotting and there is no weight gain with me or mood swings that I have noticed I have fallen in love with this birth control
2528,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42712,1,This is my second time on the camrese lo My first experience was pretty crappy I started spotting the last week of the first pack and didnt stop spotting until the week before my period week I had a easy light period whice was nice I had my dr give me a script for something else just taking a normal day cycle My period was terrible though so i chose to try the camrese lo again So far im in the third pack and no spotting I think my body needed to re adjust or something from the mini pill i was on before Either way im very happy with my results the second time around
2530,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42689,0,The first contraceptive pill that works for me No depression with this pill just a few weeks of heavy PMSlike symptoms cramps exhaustion moodiness at first then it stabilized Trustworthy predictable and not having a period but once a quarter has been nice
2532,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42682,6,My daughter was on this birth control for a few years I lost her to a pulmonary embolism last year She was only Do I feel this pill played some part in what happened absolutely Be careful and weigh your options I took birth control and not for one minute did I think this would happen but everyones body acts differently and tolerates things differently There needs to be a safer way for young girls
2533,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42103,1,I have had horrible acne since taking this birth control All over my body acne I didnt realize it could be the birth control until I read a bunch of other reviews on it My boobs hurt all the time No sex drive what so ever I dont even want my husband to touch me because my boobs hurt so bad Needless to say I sympathize with some of the other reviewers on this birth control I will be talking to my doctor to switch to something else The only good part about it is not getting my period for months
2535,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42052,3,Im currently taking this and the first two entire packs were fine some minimal spotting that went away within a few days This rd pack was fine until the cycle was supposed to start I had breakthrough bleeding for weeks It has finally slowed down but hasnt stopped completely Other than that this has worked decently but I feel there are too many other options for me to suffer like this
2536,Camrese,Birth Control,3,41934,10,Took this for only weeks before having to stop Caused a lump in my right breast sad mood daily constant nausea and NO sex drive
2537,Camrese,Birth Control,2,41912,11,I developed terrible depression taking this medication The first month and a half were fine even energizing I actually slept less and felt more alert the first few weeksThe first two nights I took the pill I only slept hours and woke up sweating and then couldnt sleep the rest of the night This side effect went away and then all was pretty normal for awhile Then I felt myself slowly slipping into a funk It started with a negative attitude towards things I used to enjoy and progressed into terrible depression I suspected the pill and the day after the months ended I felt immediately better and happy again It was like day and night I went back to Nuvaring after this experience
2539,Camrese,Birth Control,8,41857,9,Ive spent months on Camrese and its been great No period my acne and mood swings were under control I had occasional spotting and over the course of the past year Ive gained lbs with no other lifestyle changes which are the only reasons I will be discussing changing medication with my doctor
2540,Camrese,Birth Control,8,41826,5,I liked this medication and stayed on it for almost years However the vaginal dryness was so bad and embarrassing that I had to switch I also think the medication caused hair loss
2541,Camrese,Birth Control,1,41672,31,Taking this pill was an awful experience Everything was going fine until right around the time that I started the second month of it and since then I have had nasty breakthrough bleeding ever since then Not to mention the breast soreness leg cramps and depression Im finishing the pill this week and it hasnt gotten any better or worse So basically Ive had my period for weeks straight
2542,Camrese,Birth Control,3,41610,10,Only on day of this pill and my chest back and face are broken out completely I have bumps literally everywhere Little clusters of bumps are popping up too My breasts are starting to hurt and Ive had bad menstrual cramps today Im also super emotional as well Cried all evening for no reason and got so mad I thought my chest was going to explode So mood swings are definitely a side effect Maybe Ill see some better effects in the next month
2543,Camrese,Birth Control,4,41504,8,I have never been more exhausted in my life while on this birth control pill I was diagnosed with endometriosis and have now been on this pill for months I am still moody constantly tired feel the dull pain in my lower stomach and have had breakthrough bleeding already The bloating is awful and my breasts are so swollen and tender that I cant stand to wear a bra I was on Seasonale before and did not have these side effects whatsoever so will hopefully be going back to that now that this pill has completely changed me as a person
2545,Camrese,Birth Control,2,41079,16,Breakthrough bleeding headaches nausea bloatingHave been bleeding for almost two weeks On the fourth week of the first packet
2548,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42381,2,Was on Seasonique for a couple years it worked extremely well Hardly any breakthrough bleeding Camrese started out okay but within a couple months the bleeding began and would not stop I had consistent spotting for MONTHS I am now just coming off this pill and have started with a new one Hope this one stops the bleeding
2551,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42336,7,Good birth control for preventing against pregnancy However I thought it would be great to only have period sometimes I was wrong I had my period all of the time literally It got to the point where I had it for a full month with only a couple days without it Only take if you for sure have a regulated period with birth control
2552,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42313,6,Been taking this for a year and my body never regulated to it I spotted through almost the whole pack every single time Sexual intercourse became painful for me This has personally been the worst experience with birthcontrol for me I thought it would have been nice having a day cycle but given that I have bled through over days of it it is just absolutley not worth it
2553,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42311,5,I just wish the bleeding would stop Its light but annoying I took Seasonique before and I loved the comfort of having only periods a year I just hope I can make it long enough for this discomfort to end Im on my third month and the bleeding started weeks ago
2554,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42310,5,I was not a fan of this pill It was supposed to be three months noncyclic and I still had a period every month longer than normal And I would bleed in between It also made me gain pounds in weeks while I was counting calories and working out It was impossible to lost weight on it It made me super emotional I was constantly weepy and depressed many days I dont want to take this one ever again
2555,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42310,7,I loved this birth control Ive been on or so different pills but this is the best so far Only complaint is the intense cramps around the time of my period My period last days with normal bleeding and painful cramps The cramps are bad but not strong enough to stop taking them especially because they only occur every months I think the reason for my positive time on the pills was because Ive been on steady birth control for years straight Sad news Ive had to change to non estrogen birth control because of my high blood pressure I miss this so much lol
2556,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42308,5,I am on the third month of this birth control Since I have started Camrese my face remains clear and my breats grew a bit as well And I like the idea of having only four periods a year However the spotting has been an absolute nightmare I had no spotting at all up until the end of month two and the spotting has not stopped since I am nearing the end of month three Sometimes it will seem like it has stopped but then an hour later I will be bleeding again It is exhausting I dont know when it will stop but I hope it will stop soon or Ill definitely switch pills again The spotting is the only negative side affect I have had thus far
2557,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42304,7,I got on this due to migraines I would have when I got my period This medication has been a savior When I first got on it I had some problems I have break through bleeding in the second month that become a full on period so I was on my period for two months but I figured it was my body getting adjusted Im on my third three month pack now No break through bleeding My boobs hurt three weeks before I get my period but other than that these medication is amazing I have my sex drive back no headaches clear skin and no weight gain
2558,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42304,6,This is the generic version of Seasonique I had been on Seasonique up until I Got pregnant which was about years After I gave birth my doctor put me on Camrese For the longest time I thought the terrible side effects were because I gave birth years later I am realizing it is Camrese I have been tired non stop depressed super emotional over the most simple things have gained pounds that I cant seem to shake headaches and my appetite has increased I would not recommend getting this birth control I will be switching back to Seasonique tomorrow it never gave me any problems
2559,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42296,4,I have been on this for over a year and I am sad that it isnt working for certain things I have a very light day period every time no breakthrough bleeding no cramps headaches or anything else My skin cleared up immensely The three biggest problems were the fact that ever since I have been on this I have absolutely no sex drive at all I have been so depressed and down and I gained pounds because of the hormone levels I would still be on it if the couple side effects I have werent so large
2562,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42266,1,So I originally started on camrese for dealing with my heavy flowpainful periods like super painful and when I started I was bleeding for over weeks I hated it it wasnt a lot of blood more like light but it was frustrating as I was not comfortable with having to wear pads all the time so I went other my doctor and she prescribed Junel fe It was terrible I had irritability nausea etc So I asked to go back to camrese and it worked for the first months no problem but then I had spotting again So I asked for a new pill but that made my period twice as heavy flow I then asked my doctor if I could have the same hormones in camrese but for monthly and not yearly but she said I can do that myself I love it now
2563,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42257,2,This birth control made me miserable By the completion of the first week I started to get these crippling headaches nausea and dizziness I also experienced a couple episodes of serious night sweats I was extremely sad the entire time I was on it To top all of that off I never stopped bleeding Thats right Ive been bleeding for weeks straight and counting Finally my mother and husband had to force me off the stuff because they saw how miserable I was The only positive was that my skin cleared up a great deal It just wasnt for me
2565,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42236,0,Ive been on this birth control for six months Pros sex drive is out of control light period period every three months which is wonderful short period Im taking days light bleed no cramps no bloatingCons took my pills before bed and the night sweats are a bummer breakthrough bleeding here and there until month four took awhile to adjust
2566,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42167,4,My doctor prescribed Camrese to lessen my increasing heavy periods presumably due to perimenopause Im at the end of the sixth month taking this drug and have nothing positive to say about it Ive gained pounds in months and am depressed that its summer and I cant fit in my size clothes anymore Whats worse is that Ive had consistent break through bleeding for the last weeks and expecting the quotforcedquot period next week Im wondering if I should just DEAL with the uber heavy periods at least they were predictable and only lasted days There was also weeks of spotting during the first months on this pill Needless to say Im consulting my ObGyn next week to try something different This pills not for me
2567,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42163,8,Literally a miracle drug my first time in a long time not having my extremely horrible period best month of my life no spotting this is my first time using birth control my acne is nonexistent my breast are larger which is a plus for me and Ive lost weight in all the right places Im so happy with this product
2568,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42146,6,At first the Camrese was great It successfully treated my cramping mood swings and acne The first two cycles I did experience some spotting but it decreased and eventually ended For about another months I experienced nearly no problems with the Camrese A little over a year from starting the Camrese I began to get significant spotting and I would take the pill at the EXACT same time everyday I also began to develop an insatiable appetite that would last a week before my period and a week after I started the new pack What prompted me to look for other forms of BC was that my mood swings would occur a week before during and after my period to the point where I was overwhelmed with unexplained angerfrustration
2569,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42137,5,I have been taking this medication for a month No breakthrough bleeding and my menstrual cycle has been a great but the negative side effects have been miserable I experienced severe mood swings depression and I am usually a happy person bloating weight gain increased appetite breast tenderness discomfort and pain in my abdomen and extreme fatigue I have been miserable since starting this medication and will discontinue it and try something else
2571,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42116,5,I love the fact of not having a period for months but there is absolutely NO sexdrive during the whole three months of taking the pill except for the first week after your period I had breakthrough bleeding for about a month but it stopped after I started the next pack I have no other side effects but the whole no sex drive thing kinda sucks
2572,Acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / pseudoephedrine,Cold Symptoms,5,42295,4,Night time Nyquil worked and relieved my stuffiness and allowed me to sleep a full hours However I did awake in the morning with excitability and extreme Hypertension This condition resolved after discontinuing night time Nyquil This medication is no longer for me for this reason after using it for years
2573,Acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / pseudoephedrine,Cold Symptoms,10,41207,6,Great Fell asleep
2574,Acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / pseudoephedrine,Cold Symptoms,9,40167,3,It tastes horrible but really helps and gets you sleeping

2578,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,42305,95,Started Plaquenil months agomg xday to treat Psoriatic arthritis and sjogrens Learned to NOT take it in the morning with my Meloxicam mg because of strong nausea If I take one after a big lunch and one after dinner I have no problems at all Joints and hands wrists are doing so much better One worry is that I am too tired to do anything at all If I do laundry I sweat If I cook dinner or rake the yard I sweat I seem to even have trouble sleeping on my side at night because of trouble getting enough air into my lungs Weird I know I rated it an because I do not feel sick after taking it and it does seem to work The last but not least worry is heavy hair loss I have thin and fine hair anyway but it comes out like crazy
2579,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,42304,108,This medication did wonders for my soreness and pain from Rheumatoid Arthritis but if someone would have told me I would have devastating and irreversible eye damage due to taking it I would have chosen a different drug for sure at least after the year mark when it is known to cause major problems that will be with you for life
2580,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1,42290,34,I started this med as I have both RA and Systemic Lupus It did nothing for me and we added Methotrexate still no benefit Added Enbrel no better My eyesight was beginning to fail so I stopped all of them My weight ballooned up by lbs I have found no mainline meds to help and had to turn to Traditional Chinese Medicine for relief Works great for me I am still hoping to find something in the regular vein of meds to help and not hurt me My insurance will not cover the help of the Traditional Chinese Medicine that is helping Whats up with that
2581,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1,42262,22,I have been taking plaquenil for over weeks to treat autoimmune hair loss My hair and itchy scalp has not improved at all In fact it was even worse for a few weeks Now Im getting sores all around my eyes with a cyst on my eyelid and an inflamed blood vessel I called my rheumy today to ask for a switch Im very disappointed because it seemed like the best out of the bunch for side effects
2582,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,42256,58,I had Lyme disease and a subsequent RA dx I have been on Plaquenil for months mg x a day and now x day It has helped a great dealI was also taking Collagen and a few herbs for inflammation I am doing much much better and able to do a lot of things I thought I never would again I have occasional stiffness but its hardly an issue On the downside I do have bad nightmares not all the time but they are something I am not happy about Anecdotally they may be correlated to Alcohol I occasionally get nausea and headaches as well but the headaches are mild and only once a week or soFingers crossed that the side effects diminish and that this drug keeps on keeping on I am best to you all D
2583,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,42245,50,I live in Uk and having all treatment under the National Health ServiceI have RA fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis blepharitis and interstitial lung disease Blimey I hear you say quite rightly I say it every dayI take hydroxychloraquine in conjunction with methatrexate and etanercept and they seem to work well together However since my methatrexate was reduced due to continual chest infections I have notice recurrance of swelling and pain has increased I am now on mg of morphine MST slow release x per day and oramorph instant effect morphine for breakout pain Docs told me that they know the three meds work in conjunction with each other but they dont know why Who cares give me the drugs Hope this helps
2586,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10,42166,73,I first went on Plaquenil in due to unbearable finger and wrist joint pain for months which was diagnosed as Lupus after a skyhigh ANA test and some other tests and diagnoses I was told it would take ish weeks to kick in and it did right on schedule Almost overnight I went from not able to hold a soda can or open a door to being pain free I was on Plaquenil for years during which time I was in complete remission so in I discontinued it In Lupus reared its ugly head again this time with Pleurisy Got back on Plaquenil and after the requisite waiting time it got the problem under control not maybe I love Plaquenil but my advice to others is to be very patient and give it time to work
2588,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42125,76,I started this medication a week ago and have had very vivid dreams I used to wake up with rib and hip painstiffness I also couldnt relax and lay in bed because my body just felt restless I would say that on day I woke up almost completely relaxed and nearly no stiffness I also started taking Celebrex on the same day so Im not sure if its the combination of the two or one or the other but I feel so much better I am a year old female and mom of a year old
2589,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42115,90,Feel so much better since being on Plaquenil since Always have reg eye tests My inflammation level is only a now and it was Still feel a little tired now and then but I blame it on working hrs a week Hope this drug helps you too
2590,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,9,42046,12,For the past years I have had itching on my head Can be any area of scalp None on face I take mg of antihistimine every day just to keep it mild But it doesnt stop it No redness no dry scalp
2591,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,7,42044,31,I started taking this medication three months agoNovember The doctor told me it would take up to three months to work After the first month the fatigue lessenedI didnt want to sleep all day longI actually wanted to moveSoon after the occurrence of joint pain also loweredIt still hurts when I push myself to hard and onrainy days but the pain isnt consistent anymore
2592,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,8,41959,90,I was diagnosed with Sjogrens Syndrome months ago I also have rheumatoid Arthritis and Hashimotos My rheumatologist prescribed Plaquenil in hopes to control all conditions I would say that Plaquenil has basically given me my life back I suffer from debilitating joint pain fatigue brain fog and extreme anxiety I had to quit working because as a high school teacher brain fog and anxiety are probably of the worst things you should be dealing with when dealing with teenagers I would give Plaquenil a but I havent been on it long enough to see the full effects I continue to have more energy every day Im back to walking as exercise again and my joint pain is very well controlled
2595,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2,41870,37,I experienced a rash over my entire body about weeks after starting taking this medicine I dont really know if it would have worked for me or not
2596,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,7,41843,48,This medication worked great for me except for some stomach upset which was I tolerating because I wanted to stay off Prednisone However three weeks into taking the medication I developed an allergy to it and broke out in hives all over my body So I had to discontinue sadly Very sorry not to be able to take this medication as it seems the best one for controlling my Lupus with the least side effects
2597,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,8,41797,71,I am only on Plaquenil a month now for primary Sjogrens Syndrome having been diagnosed in Jan So far I am feeling much better in that I am sleeping so much better Before taking medication I would wake times a night and found it difficult to go back to sleep now I only wake up once and go back almost immediately This is thefirst thing that I have noticed and I know it is very early days as my Rheumatologist said it can take months before any results
2601,Plaquenil,Dermatomyositis,8,41667,15,I have dermatomyositis Plaquenil along with quinicrine treated my hand lesions which were very painful This took about a year to accomplish Its been about a year and a half now and Im starting to react to one or both of the medications I have a rash all over my body and ulcers and lichen planus in my mouth Im seeing my doctor shortly to see about this
2602,Plaquenil,Lyme Disease Arthritis,9,41656,46,Plaquenil has been great for me It has reduced the stiffness amp swelling in hands amp feet to almost nothing Started at mg twice a day and have since reduced to one time per day I have a complete eye exam once a year to watch for possible retina side effects
2605,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,41457,157,I was told that I have rheumatoid arthritis a few months back I have been on Plaquenil now for almost months It has helped with the pain in my hands and feet I still have swollen fingers but am waiting for the full affects of the drug I do not know how common this is but the side effect that I am having is hair loss I am guessing it wouldnt be as bad if I was a male but being a female I am hoping this stops after my body gets used to the medicine because I am very discouraged with that aspect
2606,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,10,41396,155,Before Plaquenil I would be in bed for days at a time unable to move excessive pain ice cold migraines the whole gamut My body felt ancient At first the rheumatologist thought I had leukemia then Lupus and rheumatoid athritis and finally biopsies started giving us a more refined treatment plan With this medicine I am in much less pain I can walk for an hour at a time I can shop for groceries again I feel like I have a life again I have had brief periods never more than a month without it and I know that life without the benefit of Plaquenil is no life at all Yes I have to see the retina specialist but in all this time my eyes are fine Dont hesitate to try it even though new treatments can be scary
2607,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,41380,139,I had very few side effects with this medicine in the beginning but it didnt provide enough relief on days when I had to be on my feet for a few hours a day It didnt remove all inflammation so I was taken off and tried on methotrexate a lot worse side effects and no relief at all I had no vision changes with Plaquenil and I would much rather have some relief than none I was able to function with minimum pain with Plaquenil
2608,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,41342,121,I have been taking Plaquenil for about months I started out with mgx day along with Prednisone to treat my RA slowly tapering off the steroids Now I am just on PlaquenilI have to say that the pain is still there especially in the morning and late evening Sometimes it is difficult to fall asleep but I gave it a because it is nothing like before when I took no medication Perhaps it works better for others I still have the swelling and stiffness in the mornings but as I said nothing like beforeIt also only gets a because the headaches I get while taking it are debilitating I sometimes wonder if the trade off is worth it They start about minutes after taking it and last until I manage to fall asleep Sigh

2636,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42797,71,I began taking Plaquenil for RA month ago Despite information from my doctor that it would be at least months before I see an appreciable effect I am feeling better than I have in the last year Prior to Plaquenil I tried Mobic amp Medrol both with limited improvement But over the last few weeks I have been able to play basketball with my son again move without thinking or a warm up period return to the gym begin Pilates amp Ive lost pounds I did have some GI upset over the last month but nothing I would consider stopping this medication for I am able to enjoy things again amp live life without discomfort

2641,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42618,89,Ive been on this drug since Before meds I was so sick with RA symptoms Spent hours a day in bed couldnt dress or bath myself Seldom ate Doctor put me on mg plaquenil twice daily and mg prednisone and I got my life back Ive since drop prednisone and am down to mg once daily plaquenil About to go on the generic form of plaquenil A little concerned Is the quality the same My specialist said no RA drugs are so scary Ive had friends die on biologicsand some go blind My advice as geezergirl When you find out what works for you hold on tight to it
2645,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1,42444,27,I was on this medication for one day when I began to gave sereve vomiting minutes after taking it and stomach bloating and uncontrollable gas By day six I called my doctor to tell him I had bilateral muscle weakness in my legs and could hardly walk a straight line without feeling like I was going to fall down My doctor stopped the medication after six days after I began to take it when I presented with a known severe adverse side effect of this medication quot muscle weakness and loss of coordinationquot

2648,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,42430,48,Im and was told I have arthritis about months ago Plaquenil worked after the first couple of weeks but one major side effect is Mouth Ulcers and at times Ive been in so much pain with them I couldnt eat But then the alternative one said it could make my hair fall out and that is not an option at my age
2650,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10,42392,26,I had only had a mild SLE flare about years ago I had plenty of the discoid lupus symptoms but they were easily controlled with avoiding the sun and using sunscreensespecially in the last years I developed another autoimmune problem about years agogluten intolerance or or possible CD I ate the quotglutenfreequot Cheerios when they hit the shelves about months ago and almost killed myself as they were not gluten free This touched off a SLE flare of unbelievable proportions Practically every joint in my body was hurting SO badlyand I had fever and fatigue and did not respond to NSAIDs Placquenil has been my lifesaver Adhering to an antiinflammatory diet for a month helped also The priceworth it
2651,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42391,195,I have been on Plaquenil since when I was diagnosed with RA When I was diagnosed I was in severe pain unable to hold my infant child or drive My rheumatologist injected me with steroids to get me immediate relief and started me on Plaquenil I dont remember my initial dosage but I take mg once per day and have been in remission since and I have had no side effects that I am aware of I have regular eye exams and periodic screenings by a retinologist and my eyes have had no issues at all

2655,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,2,40633,41,I have seen no benefits from this medication after months of use My migraines have increased to almost daily now and have also increased in their intensity
2660,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,40340,166,I began taking Plaquenil weeks ago and I am pleased with it Im now seeing the benefits and my Rheumatologist says that I should continue to get even better over the next months Honestly Im okay with where Im already at The biggest surprise is that Im receiving benefits that I didnt get from mgday of Prednisone The hardest part was when I first began Plaquenil You initially experience side effects without any benefit but you just have to hang in there The side effects start to improve significantly after weeks My side effects were nausea loose stools vomiting and temporary changes in vision full eye exam confirmed that everything is fine I would highly recommend this medicine

2748,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,3,41546,41,Diltiazem for High Blood Pressure Atrial Fibrillation Atrial Flutter I took Diltiazem before surgery and then continued it after for high blood pressure It worked just fine for a while although the hr only lasted for hours in my case Then I started getting toothaches and really bad gingivitis I did have gingivitis already I also started feeling lousy and only by coincidence did I stop taking the Diltiazem Two day later my toothaches were gone and my gums stated clearing up I still thought it was a coincidence I restarted Diltiazem again and the same thing happened again
2749,Mydayis,ADHD,8,43070,2,Ive been taking Mydayis for about weeksI was diagnosed with ADHD yrs ago and took Adderall XR mgs mgs every day Even though it helped me in many ways it also made me antisocial anxious over use it sometimes and very thirsty at all timesFor those reasons I decided to try something else Mydayis Honestly I feel much more motivated my energy increased Im not longer antisocial no crash and most importantly I can focus wellFor about a week I had some side effects increased heart beat couldnt sleep focus well high BP so give it some time to adjust I also read that most people that switched from Vyvanse to Mydayis are suffering from depression Be careful
2755,Mydayis,ADHD,10,43047,5,I was on Vyvanse mg for Bulimia it stopped the binge eating however I could never fall asleep not even with a sleeping pill and I always felt so very depressed in the late afternoon my doctor told me about Mydayis I switched to Mydayis mg which works even better I get a good nights sleep without a sleeping pill The only side effect is dry mouth and an occasional headache If I wait too late to take it Its always best to take it early in the morning I take mine at am I still have remained free from any binge eating episodes Thankful for this medication
2759,Mydayis,ADHD,9,43041,4,Mydayis works great if you are on the right dose I noticed some people on here are not getting the right strength when converting from Vyvanse or Adderall To the person whorsquos doctor switched you from of Vyvanse to mg of Mydayis your getting less medication Thatrsquos why itrsquos not working for you You should be taking mg You will notice a BIG difference
2761,Mydayis,ADHD,4,43014,7,I was prescribed vyvanse chewable mg in the am and at noon I loved it but had a month where I didnt take it regularly at noon Dr suggested this because of the extended release weeks in My sleep is concerning I havent hit rem in days now I have no appetite even in the am before I take the mydayis I have to force feed myself even icecream is a struggle after the rd bite The hours after I take it I feel lost cant track conversations nominimal recall I cant even prioritize After those hours things level out a bit but I dont have the motivation I had with Vyvanse I believe there is link between loss of quality sleep and stuggling to meet my dietary requirements and how the drug affects me
2762,Mydayis,ADHD,5,43012,7,Taking mg right now and was on adderall XR mg I dont understand this medicine since it usually makes me tired and down for about hours after taking it then get an okay amount of focus for another hours I personally cant deal with those hours everyday when I need to be productive so I will try something else This drug may be very similar to the chemicals in adderall but it definitely does not feel like it
2766,Mydayis,ADHD,2,42993,10,Not at all what I expected Have used Vyvanse with success but went back to adderall more flexibility dosing Can take a second dose during the day if necessary or not Mydayis takes an unusually long time to kick in Have found that I am much more irritable foggy and have experienced feelings of being overwhelmed at work doing things that I normally handle day in and day out with no problem I am for the most part easy going everything seems to annoy me since I began using Mydayis Also have experienced headaches during lag times body aches and flu like symptoms A lot of the time I feel worse than I do unmedicated Do not like Mydayis at all Will not be refilling
2767,Mydayis,ADHD,1,42991,15,I wanted this medication to work because I often forget to take my second generic adderral dose on time However Mydayis is not the wonder drug I wanted it to be It takes up to hours to kick in something they hide in the facts and even though I quotworkedquot this drawback by waking up earlier to take it there wasnt enough positives to keep me taking it past week four It lasted about hours before it quickly declined and leaving me with even worse ADD symptoms It was so bad I couldnt have a conversation or focus enough to make dinner without skipping into laundry cleaning or some other distractions Without the use of any medication I have never had symptoms this bad If this wasnt bad enough I had horrible nausea and indigestion
2768,Mydayis,ADHD,1,42991,10,Meh I was on Vyvanse mgday amp switched to Mydayis mgday NOT what I was hoping for Not by a Long Shot While it quotlasts longerquot than VYVANSE was on Vyvanse for years which only gave me about hours in the end it gives me MUCH LESS motivation Makes me depressed Im Very Sorry I did not only get Only a week supply rather than month I have no insurance amp it was about more than Vyvanse Needless to say I will request Vyvanse again at my next appt BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
2772,Mydayis,ADHD,2,42985,7,Not helpful for hyperactivity Lasts a long time but doesnt help much On mg but maybe the dose recommendation is too low
2773,Mydayis,ADHD,1,42981,12,Never had so many thoughts really down thoughts as I did well on this medication Also daily dosage only lasted hours before effect decreased rapidly Generic Adderall lasts longer with no downers This one was not the godsend I had hoped it would be
2775,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,10,40060,31,After my cardiologist tried me on many different combinations of Blood Pressure medications over a period of years Diltiazem worked perfectly Im on the maximum dosage allowed but take it twice a day in different dosages With Hyzaar at breakfast I take mg of Diltiazem With dinner I take mg of Diltiazem I have had no side effects that Im aware of Incidentally when I was put on Diltiazem I was taken off Toprol XL and I felt so much better after Toprol was out of my system I had no idea it was affecting me adversely until I was off it I saw on the review of Toprol that for as many people who said they tolerated it well there were an equal amount of others who had bad reactions to it
2776,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,8,40049,30,Helps my atrial fibrillation Last ECG was normal
2777,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,10,40035,50,I was on Cartia XT when they discontinued it It is the ONLY drug that works for me There was no warning from CVS either I went into fibrillation The doctor put me on four different drugs after that of which none worked One was too hard and large to swallow one had food dye and I am allergic and one made my head ring terribly Another one is on the way but it is twice a day Since I also have fibromyalgia I have to be extra careful
2779,Diltiazem,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9,40026,53,I have been on this medication a couple of years for supraventricular tachycardia and hypertension and have not had ONE episode of SVT since being on it I used to get SVT once or twice a month so this medicine has truly made my life better The problem I now face is with my insurance company since they are hiking up nongeneric copays to times as much as before Since there is no generic until I must either forego this medicine and try something else or pay something I cant afford This is frustrating when I know the medicine works
2781,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,10,40001,66,I use Cartia XT for Afibrillation The only problem I ran into was using generics CVS switched their provider and it did not work as well days of Afibrillation and I went on the real deal What a difference everything is back to normal
2782,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,5,39957,59,I switched to Cardizem from ToprolXL Cardizem tires me for about hours then Im good
2783,Diltiazem,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,39956,72,I have been taking Cartia XT for supraventricular tachycardia for about years This medication has completely controlled the racing heart that I used to get from time to time Ive had no side effects A big bonus is that eating ice cream used to trigger the racing heart beat Now I can eat ice cream
2785,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,6,39926,52,Be prepared for a quotmental health dayquot My first mg dose wiped me out for a full hours I was dizzy and just plain off Sitting to standing was a crash and burn experiment It passed quickly and since nd day was okay
2786,Diltiazem,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,8,39909,24,I have taken Diltiazem for the past week for blood pressure and angina issues pain in my chest I has worked wonders however it does make you rather dizzy at times I take this with Plavix as my cardiologist recommended
2787,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,10,39818,133,Excellent treatment for high blood pressure Been taking for over years with excellent results
2788,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,8,39722,52,Ive recently started it to lower excessive blood pressure It does that I feel more comfortable and relaxed too However it does bring on light headaches sometimes
2789,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,10,39610,152,I am taking Cartia XT MG for atrial fibrillation It works and I have not noticed any other side effects other than being sleepy all of the morning I take it at am and usually could fall asleep without much prompting However Im not groggy and can concentrate fine The heart is in rhythm and thats what counts
2790,Dynacin,Acne,8,39800,10,This drug is very helpful I used to have pus filled acne all over my face and now very few of them It does nothing for white heads and clogged pores but does get rid of the pus filled looking ones
2791,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,7,43056,1,At bulging cervical disks CC stenosis with radiculopathy into my trachea Very strange and unbelievably painful years tons of epidurals physical therapy hot packs and yes pain meds This one is a winner with a giant caveatFirst narco then percocet then oxycontin then zohydro then back to Narco Not funBELBUCA It works well enough You have ZERO euphoria or any druggie feeling you can function and be productive The pain blocking sensation that a true opioid provides is thereMy only gripe is the tiny hr ldquomouth patchrdquo itself This is a disaster and has caused several destroyed patches that refused to insert and stck to finger HUGELY frustrating Will not properly dose unless applied perfectly
2792,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,2,43028,2,I hate reading reviews before I take a med because it does have a placebo affect on you whether itrsquoll work or not If yoursquore doing this stop Just take the meds and see how it works for YOU But I was put on belbuca after misusing Vicodin from chronic pain and disc replacement surgery Vicodin helped but dosage wasnrsquot enough and I abused it But belbuca Never helped my pain Started at and had WDs so bumped to mg and helped WDs but not pain I had break through meds but Belbuca renders them useless I ended up taking more BT meds trying to help pain on bad days but then sent red flags to my doc He didnrsquot seem to get Belbuca did not work for me Withdrawals are GOD AWFUL
2793,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1,42969,7,I tried the mcg no relief and dr refused to give break thru pain meds told me to use OTC meds alternate Tylenol and Advil every hrs for the st month but she finally gave me ten pain pills for st month So the end month I go to mcg and get copay help card well after three days of runaround they tell me the card only works for st month If the pharmacy puts it in right so my script had a copay which I can not afford Tried to ask why they advertise help with copay yet they dont really offer help So instead of paying For second month I had to pay full copay so just make sure you can afford it before you start it Oh and no the film dont actually help as the s actually bunch and not melt so
2794,Belbuca,Pain,1,42951,14,I was on Fentynal patches for year and a half mcg I was needing a little more pain relief so the doctor was going to switch me to Butrans insurance wouldnt pay so he decided Belbuca Ive currently been on it for almost weeks I cant sleep more than an hour a day I have a massive headache all the time and my skin crawls like theres bugs under it almost Ive talk to the doctor he will not listen its not controlling the pain it wears off for hours before the next dose I cant hold food down and I have no desire to drink anything either
2795,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1,42949,38,Dealing with arthritis over years first ran the gamut of all the meds was lambasted when I suggested old fashioned pain meds Finally told nothing more rheumatology could do for me that I should try pain mgmt That equals opioid therapy was a godsend for me years now no problemsside effects take as prescribed rarely asked for increase I take as prescribed responsibly With the climate how it is today theres a stigma if you are on opioid therapy you are addicted BS After years if I was going to have problems they would have happened by now Belbuca IMO is using devious marketing ploys it does not work Maybe a minority but what about honest law abiding patients who benefit from opioids taking it responsibly
2799,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1,42865,42,I suffer from severe arthritis of hips and knees and they need to be replaced My Dr put me on belbuca along with my other pain meds and Im just gonna tell you belbuca is a joke Thanks to all you junkies out there people like me that suffer everyday from chronic pain literally are forced on this drug because all you crack heads want to get high You will eventually start trying to abuse this and they will ban it as well Because you find anyway to abuse something thanks to you all Think of this when you get hurt real bad and need pain meds and the Dr wont give you any because they dont make them anymore Think of that and I hope you finally see for your self but belbuca is a joke

2804,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,8,42792,42,My insurance is not covering Butrans patch anymore so my doctor started me on Belbeca mcg every hours I was concerned about it because of the negative reviews it received about its effectiveness and adhesive not staying put in the mouth I suffer with fibromyalgia and herniated discs in cervical thoracic and lumbar regions and sciatic nerve pain down to my foot I have not had issues with it sticking in my mouth I place a finger inside till it sticks and one outside my check if needed It stays put with no issues It has helped my pain better than the patch and Im taking less tramadol and zanaflex some days I dont need it Past few weeks I feel my pain is controlled Im not waking up in pain and feel alert to work

2834,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,2,42601,18,Ive just had my first dose so too soon to review its effectiveness It is very difficult to open the packaging and apply even after practicing with the trainer they provide This morning I found some things that helped me and I hope they might help others I cut past the suggested lines at least of an inch my shaky fingers barely got the first one open ha Instead of using my fingers I used tweezers to pick up and place the patch in my cheek Good luck to all
2835,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,3,42594,15,After years of chronic lower back pain and spinal fusion a year ago still experiencing chronic pain and now numbness and pain down both legs Doc started me on Belbuca a couple weeks ago at mcg and increased to mcg dose every hrs The little patch sure can be tricky to stick to the inside of my cheek The medication can be difficult to remove from the foil package but Im getting better at it My experience has been some pain relief without brain fog We will see how this goes I still have Percocet for break out pain Also its important to note that even after hrs the patch hasnt completely dissolved Im going to stick with it with the hope that it keeps more of my pain under control
2837,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,4,42576,17,I was prescribed Suboxone buprenorphine for chronic pain in When the patch Butrans came along I was given that but it itched too much Recently I moved to an area that virtually has no idea that buprenorphine is great for pain relief After much suffering I found someone who would prescribe it for such but my insurance also is behind the times and so after a few copays I heard about Belbuca so I tried it After a couple of doses I figured out the best way to open the pouch and for the most part it dissolved fine The problem is its just too weak The highest dose didnt cut it for me I gave it up and accepted the generic sublingual tablets of buprenorphine which are covered by my insurance They are fine
2838,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,8,42574,35,wow I cannot believe the negative comments well i was on many different medications i mean from oxycontin opana dilaudid u name it i been on it I have chronic back pain had surgeries I personal love the medication it works for me and as far as having nausea absoulety none at all Every one say they got nausea maybe u need to start out at a low dose I am on the highest dose and i love it yes the film does stick but its not bad to meso to anyone out there i suggest everyone is different and give it a try idk maybe it works best for different kinds of pain when i was on oxycontin now that made me nausea and felt like i couldt breathe

2975,Reclast,Osteoporosis,10,39535,240,I was given a minute infusion of Zolendronic Acid for post Menapausel Osteoporosis which I had had since I was diognosed with Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis and was taking large doses of Prednisilone and Imuran I started to have stress fractures in ribs and the Vertebrea and lost inches in height I was given all the Bisophosphates and had many episodes of reflux and had dreadful backpainI was asked by a British consultant to try Zolendronic Acid which I have found wonderful
2976,Tiagabine,Seizures,3,42940,0,Was sold this at my local GNC storename on bottle is GABA mg Clerk recommended when I mentioned that I have difficulty staying asleep as a natural supplement to help my brain stay quiet at night Worked for a couple weeks then symptoms became worse than ever so I stopped taking it
2977,Tiagabine,Seizures,3,42603,0,Controlled neural activity for a while but ended up being hallucinogenic thus it could no longer be used
2978,Tiagabine,Bipolar Disorde,10,41455,9,Immedietly stopped my mood swings one of the only mood stabilizers that helps me
2980,Alavert,Urticaria,10,41332,26,I have been taking this medication for years due to multiple allergies I TAKE IT AT NIGHT AS IT CAN CAUSE DROWSINESS ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY I HAVE NOT FOUND THIS TO BE A PROBLEM
2982,Vivelle,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,39967,46,Ive been Vivelle for at least years now HRT pills upset my stomach and were not as effective for me I tried the generic version of Vivelle but it was a much larger patch and did not stick as well The adhesive on the generic also gave me a rash Stick to the brand on this one would be my recommendation Im down to the lowest dose hopefully will be done completely in another year or so But this has saved my sanity and that of those around me
2983,Vivelle,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,39513,59,I have been on the Vivelle Dot for years after having my hysterectomy It is wonderful and has controlled my hotflashes night sweats breast tenderness and dry sking The Vivelle Dot is a much better drug for me than Premarin The Premarin was making my skin literally very dry and shrivel At first the Premarin was fine and after several years it started to have a very different effect on me causing pain during intercourse and very dry skin Changed to Vivelle Dot and all symptoms went away
2984,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Nasal Congestion,5,42978,1,Big mistake taking my first Claritin D at PM for sinus pressure from using a nasal decongestant the day before and getting a rebound effect of clogged breathing passages Didnt sleep a wink all night My nasal passages are wide open though so it works However insomnia is a real pain Its AM and I feel like it should be AM bedtime Ill be struggling through the day today Restless In Philly
2985,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Nasal Congestion,8,42364,5,I started this medication days ago due to post nasal drip phlegm coughs runny nose My doctor told me to take hour As far as side effects I experienced slight insomniaa little longer to fall asleep my head is not quite clear I feel a little foggy when I need to concentrate and a little fatigue No major side effects The medication has helped but has not completely quotcuredquot me So overall its worked but its not a miracle
2986,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Nasal Congestion,1,42251,6,Benadryl is WAYYYYY better Claritin does almost nothing for my allergies Would strongly suggest not wasting your money on this product
2987,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Allergic Rhinitis,10,41273,3,I have been taking this for my allergies for a few years now and LOVE IT The single daily dosage is great I have NO quotdowntimequot between doses However every year the supply runs out
2989,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Allergic Rhinitis,8,40070,12,Works great most of the time The problem is the price is going up and up The other problem is the restriction on the amount that can be purchased at one time I take one everyday but I can only buy at a time and only in a month Its hard to believe that the sale of the medicine has to be controlled On the last day of the month I have to wait until the next day to buy the med so stupid Especially when traveling and I cant purchase some in advance It should be prescription again so I can receive at one time
2990,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43078,2,I took this medicine for only days Itrsquos is the worse antibiotics I took my whole life If I could say anything it would be DONT EVER TRY IT You will feel almost dead After hours without this Irsquom feeling much better not but Donrsquot take this drug Itrsquos a poison
2991,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,43075,0,I have had many bladder infections in my lifetime and twice was prescribed nitrofurantoin Both times I took this medication I got a fever and was really lightheaded had bad diarrhea and was dehydrated severely probably because I had to force myself to eat and drink due to severe nausea on top of the diarrhea My bladder infection symptoms didnt improve eitherThe first time I took this medication I just assumed the symptoms were from my bladder infection getting worse and not improving Either way I ended up passing out at work and being taken by ambulance to the hospital for severe dehydrationThe second time I took the medicationafter I told my doctors it didnt work the first time and they convinced me to try it again same
2993,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,43072,0,I also have really bad nausea when taking these tablets try drinking peppermint tea I found it helped a wonder
2996,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,43068,3,Cant even explain how bad this made me feel SERIOUSLY thought I was dying ChillsSweating throwing upI actually passed out on my bathroom bath My chest pain was so bad I thought I was having a heart attack No desire to eatIve never had a problem with meds like this before in my life Never again I took it for days and stopped Be cautious
2997,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43065,1,Extreme drowsiness Never felt quite this drowsy from taking a medication Irsquom vomiting every hour or so I feel so sick I donrsquot even want to leave my bed It seems to be working for my UTI however so thatrsquos good Maybe itrsquos meant to flush your system out which is why most people puke Who knows
3000,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,43058,4,First Thank goodness I didnt read these reviews or I wouldnt have tried it Interesting that the side effects everyone is describing are the same side effects I had on Ciprofloxicin I was very worried taking this antibiotic because I lately dont do well Also I have gotten hives from Bactrim so I got nervous taking any antibiotic The difference this time Im eating yogurt and taking a probiotic so I wonder if that made a difference No pain at all in body no tiredness no dizziness I dont even feel like Im on a drug Im beginning to wonder if sometimes when we take these drugs it depends on our bodies at the time When I got hives from Bactrim and told the doctor she said I had been on it before Definitely eat yogurt and take probiotics
3001,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,43057,1,Had a painful UTI after about hours on the Nitrofurantoin the UTI wasnrsquot as intense I am extremely sensitive to medications and havenrsquot had much of an issue so far Mind you I drink about oz of water every day maybe that helpsHave had a little headache and I am sort of fatigued otherwise no issues
3002,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,43057,1,I was prescribed this to be taken times daily for days My UTI symptoms were gone by the first day I have now finished the course and my UTI is gone This medication worked great for the infection I did not experience any serious side effects except some tiredness spaced out feeling and on the nd day I did feel very down not sure if that was because of the medication However on the third day I feel fine
3003,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43051,2,I have been so ill for days I get sick a lot so I tried to brush it off but itrsquos to the point I was considering going to the hospital Irsquom vomiting so bad itrsquos painful I think about recently being prescribed this med and notice that oh itrsquos this damn pill that has me so violently ill Irsquom still vomiting violently thatrsquos not even right Omg someone save me lol also tired achy skin blisters feel off like speedy light headed Def no longer taking them
3004,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43050,1,Within hours I experienced muscle pain and spasms in my back and diarrhea Within hours I was experiencing respiratory issues shortening of breath and a nasty cough and the start of a yeast infection
3005,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,43049,1,Was given mg doses to take twice a day for days Irsquom only on my rd day taking these and Irsquom beyond miserable I wake up every night with unrelenting nausea fever and cold sweats The morning after my second day taking these I was admitted to the ER for the symptoms and was prescribed Pepcid antacid for all the excess stomach acids and zofran for the nausea The Pepcid helps a lot but the symptoms persist like I cannot get a good nights sleep due to the fever and cold sweats and initial nausea The zofran tastes so bad when dissolving that I cannot take it Alternatively I found that vaping or smoking small amounts of cannabis small dabs or bowls has helped calm the nausea enough for me to try and tough it out
3006,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43047,3,I was prescribed this for a UTI Took dose mg in the morning as directed and within hours was exhausted and lethargic Later that night I was experiencing chills woke up in a delirious fever like state exhaustion nausea cant eat severe joint pain everywhere especially in my spine and knees tightness in my lungs I feel like crying because the the show must go on and I feel like I have the flu Im hoping by tomorrow hours after dose I start to feel better Ive taken other antibiotics along with probiotics and never had a problem This is an awful feeling Seems like it works for others but must not mix with my body chemistry never again would rather take penicillin and deal with getting hives again
3009,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43025,4,Macrobid did nothing to eliminate my UTI It was a failure just like amoxicillian I was a bit nauseous at first but nothing that affected me I took it for ten days
3011,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,43017,3,I cant remember why I was prescribed this medication I do remember it was because I needed a strong antibiotic This medication caused me to bleed internally and have horrible diarrhea and subsequent dehydration within the first two days I took it I took it as directed and ensured I took it twice a day with meals I went to see my doctor the day after the adverse side effects began and he advised me to discontinue the medication immediately and to never take it again At the time May there wasnt much known about this medication nor its side effects
3013,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,7,43016,1,Macrodantin was prescribed to me to prevent UTI I only have to take one when needed During one month I got four fever attacks with chills headaches and muscle cramps Very much like flu symptoms It goes on for days then I am fine again Eventually I realised that it might be this medication since I took one on a Friday evening and the next day when I woke up I got this horrible symptoms again I read about the side effects and realised that this might be the cause
3014,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43012,19,Awful medication I was only prescribed tablets to take and if Id read on here about them I would have stopped after the first Horrific headaches straight away constantly nausea so much so I could barely eat to take my next tablet drowsiness where Im bumbling about my flat constantly heat sweats skin sensitivity My neck is unbelievably sore making my headaches much worse
3016,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,43006,6,year old female I was not showing any signs of a UTI My doctor tested my urine and quotthought there maybe a possiblity of a UTIquot Therefore as a precaution I was prescribed mg twice a day for days I was extremely tired a bit dizzy at times mild headache Within hrs I had severe chills temp jumped up to sweated out all night Seem to be a bit better this morning temp returned to normal But still very tired and headache I felt better prior as I had NO symptoms Trying to stick it out for another days Sign
3018,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42996,11,This is a serious antibiotic I have never had such adverse sideeffects to a medication than I have with nitro I had a UTI that kept coming back for about month Doc finally put me on Nitro after cipro and everything else didnt work I am on day of a day dose and feel like I am dying I cant get a good rest My lungs feel congested but I cant cough up anything and my cough is dry I get panicky and frustrated very easily I have ZERO energy My hair is thinning I am freezing constantly Overall I feel like I am getting over the flu Unlike those who complain of diarrhea I have severe constipation I am only one day away from the end I just need to tough it out one more day
3019,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42992,9,I had a UTI not too long ago and I was prescribed Macrobid I did not have any crazy side effects Unfortunately I get them frequently and just started a new round of Macrobid and this time has been nothing but bad news I am on day of and I have been extremely nauseous dizzy and tired along with sharp abdominal pain The UTI isnt as severe anymore but I feel like it hasnt been as effective and that its still lingering I made sure to eat a decent meal before and drink plenty of water I think that its just not reacting well with my system I am definitely stopping after today and going to the doctor to figure out a new solution
3021,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42991,21,So Macrobid can certainly have some uncomfortable side effects Most of these are preventabletreatable with headache pills taking it with lots of food and probiotics If you are allergic that is not the fault of the medicine nor is it yours Thats just the way the cards were dealtMacrobid or nitrofurantoin is very good for UTI treatment and the methods it does so makes bacteria unlikely to build resistance to it Macrobid should be the first option before general antibiotics for this reasonMacrobid works very well and usually is taken twice daily breakfast dinner For me I had fatigue and headaches but they left after two days After that I felt fine for the remaining days And it worked
3025,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42978,11,I was prescribed this for a UTI and while it did help with that it ended up giving me the worst yeast infection of my life that I am still treating months later I usually dont have too much of an issue with antibiotics but this was awful
3026,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42977,7,Took this for a UTI that wouldnt let me eat for days got my appetite back although this pill took a little longer to clear it than others Ive been on The only noticeable side effect was neon yellow urine so that made it difficult to tell if I was hydrated enough I read how lots of other people have had a bad experience this pill helped me get back to work
3027,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42976,14,I was prescribed Microbid for a UTI that I had for about weeks I took pills so far mg each I have stomach issues so I took mine with vanilla yogurt and had no nausea or vomiting I highly suggest yogurt when taking antibiotics It works like a charm I have had no bad issues or side effects I already feel better after pills Give the medication a chance its working to kill bad bacteria which can make anyone feel yucky Good luck
3028,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42976,6,Alright so in terms of this medication it did its job One thing I know after having UTIs here and there on occasion that antibiotics are downright AGGRESSIVE Even with other antibiotics I had experience similar side effects But Id say for those who are not big on side effects this is not the greatest Everybodys bodies are different but in my case I had some of the side affects posted hard time sleeping soreness headaches oddly colored diarrhea you name it In general nitrofuranctoin means business and really buckle up for the side affects but it did the job for me and I saw improvement with my UTI in days so far on my th day and no UTI
3031,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42974,12,I had a bladder infection for the first time in my life and was prescribed this medication Worst experience of my life Immediately upon taking this medication I took food with it which is recommended I started experiencing a horrible panic attack followed by wheezing and coughing But that wasnt the worst of it I began feeling nauseous and started vomiting I threw up all the food I had eaten I felt like I had a severe case of food poisoning I had to stay in bed all day in case I vomited again Thankfully I didnt and I must admit that my UTI symptoms disappeared after that first pill but never again will I take this medicationI hope this helped
3033,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,3,42971,14,After having six UTIs in about months my urogyn put me on mg of Macrobid one every night After ten solid months of it I spent days in the hospital thought I was having a heart attack Turned out it was a pulmonary problem Heavy pressure in the chest shortness of breath and tingling around the lips Going back and researching Macrobid I found out that indeed long term usage can cause pulmonary problems I do think if works for short term usage
3034,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42966,9,Was prescribed days of trimethoprim for a UTI and they didnt touch it Im now on day of a day course of nitrafurantoin and I have had terrible diarrhea and stomach cramps My wee has also turned a bright yellow which Im concerned about since I thought it only turned dark yellow or brown on these tablets Anyway my UTI symptoms dont seem to have gotten any better
3035,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42966,12,Worse antibiotic I have ever taken This is the first time Ive ever take an antibiotic and felt worse than the infection
3039,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42956,9,I have a history of kidney infections and a new doc saw me as an emergency and gave me days worth of Nitro and days later I still felt rough so the doctor gave me a longer doseits two days since and I hurt EVERYWHERE I feel like my whole body is shaking and I have had hallucinations and nights sweats went to docs AGAIN just now and been prescribed a new antibiotic as he said that nitro has not worked and my fever is getting higher everyday Stupid pills
3041,Talacen,Pain,9,40976,12,I have rheumatoid arthritis and a few other bone and joint issues Docs have had me on all oxycodone Vicoden Percocet Tylenol None of them do anything to relieve my pain Dr put me on Talacen IT WORKS No side effects
3042,Talacen,Pain,8,39964,19,I have been using Talacen off and on for a year Used for arthritis pain in lower back neck and joints Only use when in severe pain I do not notice any of the side effects Works well for me
3043,Olux-E,Atopic Dermatitis,10,39895,16,I was prescribed OluxE for Psorisis of the scalp I made an appointment with a dermatologist because I was embarrassed by the flakes and condition of my scalp Symptoms were cut in half after two days of use and gone in four I can wear black again It still itches a bit but the flakes are gone Couldnt be happier It is a topical steroid so Im going to stop using and keep some on hand for the occasional flare upSo impressed THANK YOU
3045,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42907,9,Realised I had a UTI after waking up with the symptoms Im sure you all knowso decided to book an appointment as soon as possible First dose I had a bad headache and nausea but nothing unbearable and by the second dose my symptoms were starting to disappear less than hours after starting the medication Nausea is still there about hours after I take a pill but Im nearing the end of my course I understand that some people have bad reactions but in my experience this medication was great at relieving symptoms quickly and hopefully my UTI will be no more in a couple days
3047,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42907,11,I suffer from UTIS alot really severe The doctors give this tablet only when the infection is really high as its a hardcore one hence why they make you feel a little sleepy Just make sure you eat with each dose as if you dont it can cause sickness and tummy upsets not nicebut if you eat and do it right you will be fine and that horrible burning sensation will fade Complete your full course even if symptoms have stopped
3048,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42906,20,After reading so many horror stories I was terrified to take this But my UTI was unbearable so I decided there was no other option I have taken it with food and a few hours later I pop a few good probiotics I am on day and still have not experienced any of the awful symptoms described here I did notice a headache the first day and slight nausea but that went away once I ate My UTI symptoms diminished after hours and I am one happy camper Lesson learned the internet causes anxiety lol
3049,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42899,22,I took this drug after being prescribed it for a UTI I read some reviews after feeling a little weird but figured I would push through I called my doctor after taking two pills and the nurse told me to wait it out and see if it gets worse Things got worse very quick What began as a little bit of nausea ended with body aches leg cramps intense chills night sweats dizziness confusion to fainting twice terrifying to getting a vaginal infection because of this drugMy UTI symptoms have gotten better but the pain from my VI is unbearable and how I feel from this drug is terrible NOT worth itdo not take this drug PS I only got through taking FOUR pills out of my prescribed ten I am going to the doctor today again
3050,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42896,13,After having severe headache and vomiting with a sulfa drug I was put on Macrobid for my UTI I got a little headache after second dose but popped a Tylenol Also made sure I took my pills with food I was able to finish the full regimen and although the UTI took a bit longer to get kicked out the Macrobid worked It really wasnt bad at all to take I have many food allergies too and was able to tolerate Macrobid pretty well
3053,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42895,5,Ive had a few UTIs in the past and Ive always received other antibiotics even though I go to the same clinic They gave me Nitrofurantoin yesterday and after taking the first pill on an empty stomach I was tired after an hour but it didnt bother me at all I didnt have any headaches or nausea just the feeling of an empty stomach My boyfriend said I looked exhausted but I really felt fine Im on my period so I already have some ill feelings from that I just took my second pill this morning and it already feels better when I pee I definitely think this pill should be taken right after a meal because it is strong but it does what its supposed to do In order to prevent another UTI you need this
3056,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42893,16,Awful medicine the worst The side effects outweigh the benefit Headache the first night leg and back pain Sensitive skin just awful Pain got worse and worse I changed my meds to ciproflaxcin I have used this in the past so hopefully it will continue to help I even questioned the doc at urgent care to see if I can take cipro and she offered macrobid Maybe this urgent care and this medication is something they get a deal onstay away from macrobid
3057,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42891,19,I get UTIs pretty frequently so as soon as I felt the symptoms coming on I went to an urgent care The first day of macrobid I got a headache The second day I had severe headache body aches weakness and malaise However I thought it was just my illness because I have never had an experience like this with medication before Day I am in hell and sicker than a dog Severe headache nausea light headed weak fatigued I called in for Bactrim DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION I get that not everyone has this reaction but the risk is not worth it to me
3058,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42891,5,I was prescribed Macrobid nitrofurantoin after my UTI had not gone away with the first antibiotic It definitely took care of my UTI but the side effects were and are enough for me to never take this drug again While I took this I suffered from aches that moved all over nausea headaches my ribs almost felt bruised and it seemed to make my eyes get super tired at night as I was exhausted a lot of the time anyways I stopped taking it days ago and still have muscle aches and muscle tiredness and it still feels like my lungs are trying to recover from it too Im hoping by the end of the week all of these side effects are completely gone I was healthy aside from the UTI before I began taking this Definitely wouldnt recommend it
3059,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42888,12,I was scared out of my wits to take this antibiotic after reading these reviews but I am here to put your minds at ease Im highly allergic to penicillin amp NSAIDs Ibuprofen so I have wicked medication anxiety when it comes to taking anything new I had to take this for days amp I was warned when I received this medication that it would cause dizziness nausea upset stomach and loose stools Which is all I experienced with this pill On the first day I had nausea upset stomach amp diarrhea the second day I had nausea amp dizziness on the rd day I had nausea upset stomach amp diarrhea The every other day of symptoms pattern continued the whole time I took this Make sure you have a full stock of toilet paper at home Pill tastes nasty
3061,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42882,7,Lack of sleep problem sleeping lying down then falling into a void Anxiety Had NONE of these side affects before taking this medicine I slept soundly before
3062,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42881,8,Avoid this medication AT ALL COSTS Although it may not cause side effects for some I was one of the many unlucky ones who experienced terrible problems I have never had a problem with any antibiotics except Sulfa drugs before but this medication left me nauseated vomiting dealing with chills for hours shaking so hard I couldnt move and with a terrible headache I havent taken a dose in hours with my doctors suggestion and the headache is just now going away It took about hours for the shaking to stop At one point it was so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the ER I was only two doses in as well This was worse than the Sulfa reaction I had
3064,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42864,9,This drug put me in the ER last night Ive had UTIs before and have taken cipro etc without issue but yesterday I was prescribed Nitrofurantoin for the first time Approximately two hours after taking it I felt like I was going to throw up and shortly thereafter I became severely winded after climbing just one flight of stairs I sat on the floor trying to breathe for almost a full hour and just couldnt catch my breath Then I began shaking uncontrollably and was told I needed to go to the ER as they thought my windpipe was inflamed and closing up I arrived to the hospital visibly shaking my fever shot up and I spent several hours being monitored and given pills to counteract the Nitro before they let me leave Terrifying
3066,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42859,9,I was prescribed Nitrofurantoin in for chronic UTIs I took it daily for years In at age I began experiencing serious coughing episodes I had no known allergies and no known respiratory issues I went to Health Centre After multiple tests I was diagnosed with Interstitial Lung Disease When I told the doctors about my history of taking Nitrofurantoin for UTIs they informed me that one of the side affects of this medication is respiratory problems They also informed me that anyone should not take nitrofurantoin for an extended period years Therefore they concluded that my lung disease was the direct result of taking Nitrofurantoin for an unreasonable period of time
3068,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42858,8,Been on and off this Medication for two years seems to help a great deal Im back on it due to urinary tract infection again seems since Ive turned I keep getting them Seen an Urologist two weeks ago and was told to keep taking this for the next four months
3070,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42856,9,I took this medication for a UTI Started on a Friday Its now Monday and I was told by my gyno office to stop They told me the side effects I was experiencing were not normal for the medication Have to head to the hospital to see whats up Here is what I experienced Constant nausea Headaches Weak muscles and stiff joints Blurry vision Made it hard to walk up and down stairs started to gag if I moved too quickly Tired Oh so tired If it is the medication then this is awful The side effects are worse than the UTI Ive never had a problem with any other antibiotic medication
3071,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42855,4,Experienced UTI symptoms Doc prescribed Sulfameth on pending results of culture Sulfameth barely nicked the symptoms Started Nitrofurantoin tablets daily one in the morning one at night Seemed to be working with no appreciable side effects Take with food lots of water Have been pushing water for days now Nitrofurantoin ran out on a Tuesday By Saturday night symptoms came roaring back Spent several hours crying in pain This drug ineffectual for me
3072,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42855,30,Had abdominal discomfort burning sensation and blood after urination Urgent care diagnosed me with an UTI They prescribed this for me and after taking one pill my symptoms started to subside I have only experienced slight headache but no other significant side affects My urine however did turn a different kind of yellow but when looking at the packaging this is normal and doesnt warrant concern Great antibiotic
3073,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42853,9,I know this is about nitrofurantoin but I wanted to talk about the other drug I took before Last week I noticed I had a UTI so I called my GP for an appointment they tested a sample and said there was some sort of urine infection so they prescribed me Trimethoprim which I had taken previously before day course this time the drug did not work at all if anything it made me worse this also included vomiting so I called the GP very early this morning and was seen within hours I told them my symptoms and what had happened so I sent off a sample and they prescribed me nitrofurantoin mg capsules for days Ive taken doeses today I have pills a day and I can honestly say it has already started to work
3074,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42849,21,It works great I was prescribed it to prevent UTIs after sex However my urologist took me off this medication because it can cause pulomonary fibrosis Which is a serious lung condition that can be fatal Please reconsider taking this medication There are other options Seek help from a urologist for further workup and treatment
3077,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42845,40,After being prescribed Monurol a single dose powder satchet antibiotic for a pretty nasty Bladder Infection I had to go back to the doctor because I was still in serious pain My family doctor prescribed Macrobid and after taking ONE dose I started to have relief Im pretty sensitive to medications I usually get the full list of sideeffects headache nausea diarrhoea but with Macrobid absolutely nothingnot even the weird possible quotdarkening of urinequot Believe me Im a big baby Id whine about anything this medication was amazing
3079,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42837,42,Before your freak out thinking that youre gonna have the worst experience ever on this drug dont Most people who have good experiences dont come to these sites and write reviews its always the bad ones I have terrible health anxiety and Im sensitive to lots of drugs I also had C diff months ago cured by at home Fecal Microbiota Transplantation so taking an antibiotic again was pretty scary for me The side effects I got were a slight headache and nausea for a couple hours after each pill some gas but no other digestive issues thank goodness I was feeling better on the th day and have one more day to go Take it with bread to make it easier on your stomach
3080,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42830,18,I was experiencing back to back UTIs for months After trying some alternative approaches with my doctor considering surgery she decided to put me on a daily low dose antibiotic Macrodantin It has been over three plus months and it works I honestly am not comfortable taking a daily antiobiotic but I am far more uncomfortable having a UTI No side effects for me
3082,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42817,17,I have been taking these tablets for days now amp Im amazed how quickly my symptoms cleared up st tablets in the morning amp at night I was able to go to the toilet with no pain at all Ive had another tablets today amp finish my course tomorrow all with no side affects at all Im just very relieved to be able to pee again without the horrid pain If i happen to get another UTI then I will definitely take this medication it works wonders
3083,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42816,10,Ive taken antibiotics many times before in my life but with nitrofurantoin I experienced really bad headaches after day one Quit taking them for hrs headache cleared rapidly then recommenced coursesame againvery bad headaches energy loss feeling very weak and nauseous have ceased now and feel better again Now I just have to clear up my UTI Yes reaction to antibiotic far worse than UTI Be wary of this one though everyones different
3084,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42815,7,Tested positive for UTI and was put on nitrofurantoin mg x per day for days No problems the first day evening of second day I started with a frequent dry cough not quite hacking but close Only able to sleep hours per night and coughing got worse each day Called clinic on th day and changed to Bactrim for days No burning some pressure and frequent urge to urinateGoing to doctor for regular checkup today and will discuss this but will not take this medicine again
3085,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42811,13,I was prescribed mg x daily for days I noticed my bowels were unusual more watery Also headaches were common as well Not terrible but annoying My UTI did in fact go away I recently have been having reoccurring UTIs with not being treated This was my first treatment for my UTI Im hoping they no longer continue to frequently occur So overall it gets the job done with very manageable side effects
3087,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42804,11,I was a bit scared to take this due to a bad experience years ago but the doctor said its the only anti biotic that will get rid of my current bacteria First hour I took it I was nauseous but I kept myself distracted and its been a few hours and the nauseous has gone The best thing is to drink a lot of water and eat well even if u dont have the appetite Its only been a few hours so my symptoms are still there but Im feeling quite positive that Ill be back to normal in the next couple days due to how strong this anti biotic is
3088,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42801,7,I used to have recurrent UTIs and had no problems with other antibiotics I hadnt had one in around months but am in week of my second pregnancy and theyve returned I was given nitrofurantoin mg times per day The first and second dose made me incredibly nauseous all day delirious and with a fever but freezing hands and feet The rd and th mild nausea Im on day and there are still mild cystitis symptoms and again the st dose in the morning made me nauseous and delirious Im too sick to leave the house to change my medication and have had to miss work but I will definitely be asking for something else if ever prescribed this again
3089,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,3,42800,8,I was prescribed a low dose of it for prevention if UTIs and it gave me diarrheawhich for someone already dealing with IBS Im on top of constant UTIsis not helpful at all Aside from that no side effects Still stopped taking it though and was prescribed methenamine hope it works
3090,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42799,11,Never taking this again Day of taking this antibiotic for UTI and I have never felt so ill Constant feeling of vomiting bloating and loss of appetite I rather have UTI than these symptoms Horrible
3091,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42798,46,My dr wanted to give me Cipro or Bactrim but since I have a pill complex I asked for something smaller He prescribed Macrobid and I came to this site to apparently scare myself before taking it Well Im here to tell you that this antibiotic was GREAT As someone who has colitis and constant headaches both triggered by virtually anything neither were affected by this drug I experienced zero side effects I took mg twice a day for days I would take capsule right after breakfast and capsule right after dinner so it was always accompanying a meal days later urine culture came back negative This worked great for me I didnt start feeling pain relief til day though Hang in there and take with meals
3092,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,42797,8,Ive taken two doses after my gall baldder surgery The first one left my lips swollen and a bit numb In about hour my face felt hot and looked flushed I felt tingling in my legs The second time I took it which was today after hr I felt my face really flushed again and it was red My chest broke out in a rash Now I feel flu like symptoms and I have a slight fever I feel aches all over Im calling my doctor on Monday to change antibiotics Im not taking this anymore
3093,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42797,5,Been taking nitrofurantoin for a little less than hrs and already I feel anxious nauseous and heavy depression But to be fair I havent been taking them with food in me considering I have a loss of appetite due to my UTI This is my second UTI and I dont remember me having severe side effects like the ones Im experiencing with this pill Im gonna give it another day and if my symptoms dont get better then Ill be calling in for another prescription
3095,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42950,2,I love this drug A previous horrible experience with Cipro severe diarrhea dizziness lethargy extreme weight loss and an inability to digest any of my normal foods for about years left me really afraid of the consequences of taking antibiotics again I went in to the dr refusing to take Cipro again He gave me nitrofurantoin I had NO side effects NO stomach upset NO problems whatsoever I just felt better within a day I will say that I did need to take a second day course to fully rid me of the infection but it was so easy that I did not really care If I need this drug again I will ask for a longer course next time And it is CHEAP
3096,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,42950,29,Please please please dont use this drug Was put on it for a bladder infection that I didnt even know I had and have been nothing but miserable When I first started taking it mg twice a day I noticed that I had severe nausea even though I took it with food Then body pains and head pains came My head would feel so heavy that I could barely hold it up and my ears felt as if they were full of fluid Then came the vision problems and trouble balancing and basically walking I had to take time off work because I have been have a mental breakdown because of this drug I am constantly crying or in full on panic attacks I feel like any day could be my last Please dont take this pill its not worth it Im praying this wont be forever
3097,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42948,9,The day after I started taking this I started having major leakage and had no warning I also had diarrhea but thought it was something I ate I have been off of it for days and still peeing while I sleep while I walk Its annoying Plus I still have the UTI Not a fan of this medication
3106,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42935,24,EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT I had a great experience with Macrobid I am actually allergic to a few meds so I was relieved to have one for a mean UTI I got over the last few days I actually started taking it Macrobid MG twice daily for days BEFORE coming to this site to read the reviews Firstly it says to take it with food or milk so many probably didnt follow those directions bc it will give you nauseavomiting if you dont The only side effect Ive had is drowsiness But my doctor also prescribed me with metronidazole mg taken twice daily WITH the Macrobid to offset symptoms that can bring on a yeast infection etc I only get UTIs once or twice a year but this one reared its ugly head and Macrobid worked wonders for me
3110,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42929,13,Before I started my antibiotic course of nitro I read all the reviews online about it and was terrified to take it But after being on Bactrim and cipro and neither clearing up my infection I was equally scared my infection would never go away so I took nitro anyway and was expecting to have terrible side effects However after just pills I noticed my infection was FINALLY going away I am so happy The only side effects I have is muscle aches Just remember side effects are temporary guys I am grateful for this antibiotic so far
3111,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42928,11,I was given this medicine for the nd time yesterday I have had it before no issues but this time not the case I took my first dose at night and this morning my feet and hands are burning and itchy I keep rubbing the bottom of my feet under my desk to see if it will stop I am dizzy headache and my pain is actually worse I get UTIs all the time and usually use other meds but the CVS Minute clinic gives this one for some reason I will NOT be taking anymore and will be going back to get a different medicine
3112,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42924,15,I took Macrobid a few months ago for my UTI Worked great No side effects This time after getting a UTI again I was prescribed Macrobid again but this time Im getting all the side effects Fever chill body aches fatigue nauseated etc etc I will probably stop using it now My UTI does feel a bit better though
3113,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42923,7,MOST people who write reviews here are those who have had negative experiences which can all scare you away from taking a medication so I decided to write a positive one for a change Id had symptoms of a UTIbladder infection for several weeks and all my urine tests came up negative for UTI but my MD decided to put me on this anyway based on my symptoms Id never taken it before amp Im VERY leery of taking new meds but I didnt have any real problems with it I had some mild wooziness and headache the first day and that was it no other side effects However Im only giving it an because it doesnt feel like it completely got rid of my symptoms
3114,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42921,11,Before starting on this drug I was going through a nasty cycle of UTIs amp thrush I would get a UTI due to intercourse amp after taking antibiotics to treat it I would then develop thrush The cycle happened about or times over the course of a year even though my husband amp I were taking every preventative measure possible and following drs advice wash before and after pee within minutes drink lots of water etc I even saw a urologist to try amp get to the bottom of it I couldnt break the cycle until I was prescribed this I dont take it daily after we have had intercourse I take one as a preventative Since starting this medication I have not had one UTI I have no side effects It has greatly improved my quality of life
3115,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42916,17,This is the third antibiotic in weeks used for a UTI Yes the drug has been effective in healing the infection However It would not be my st choice Ive had muscle pain in my legs and feetExhaustion Insomniagrotesque nightmares Weakness unsteadiness walking Nausea dry mouth with a taste of metal in my mouth
3116,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42916,13,Macrobid immediately helps get rid of my UTIs and I am prone to very bad ones because of some preexisting conditions Once on a trip I happened to luckily have a spare one floating around in my toiletries that I took when I realized that I had developed a UTI and in spite of not having a full regime it still got rid of it HOWEVER I do have an EXTREME reaction to Macrobid It gives me the most EXCRUCIATING body pains a couple hours after taking it The best way that I can describe it is like acid in my veins or my nerves spasming nonstop I vomit cry and cant even stand bend or roll over in bed without exacerbating the pain making me nonfunctional After about hours it goes away but it is awful until then
3117,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42911,6,I was prescribed pills for a bladder infection I got after a surgery I took the first dose pill on Friday evening Everything seemed fine until Saturday afternoon By this time I had taken pills A severe headache settled in so I took some Tylenol I started to noticed I was getting really gassy The medicine also started working at this point It was no longer painful urinating the entire time but rather only as the bladder became empty Took my rd pill and went to bed Woke up around am feeling like I had the flu Skin was hot body aches and I had chills Headache was also back ten fold Now the gas has turned into painful gas cramps I wont be taking more until I talk to my doc Monday morning
3121,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42793,24,I started Macrobid yesterday and I felt okay but today Ive had the most horrible painful stomach cramps and the weirdest constipated diarrhea I have ever had I am constantly feeling like I need to throw up and the bowel movements and pain are what prompted me to do some Internet digging I have taken four of mg pills in two days and I refuse to take another At work today I nearly tripped several times and I was disoriented felt sick and had difficulty walking straight There are other meds out there and while I know that everyone reacts differently to medication I seriously would not wish this stomachabdominal pain on anyone it is incessant and keeping me from sleeping I pray for alleviation tomorrow but fear it may take a few days
3122,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42793,44,Please dont be scared to take this medication I read the reviews and was horrified but honestly the drug was very tolerable I went through other medications for UTI before I was prescribed this one First it was Bactrim which a few hours after taking rd dose I got hives Second was Ciprofloxacin Hcl mg and I ended up with tendinitis in both legs Thirdly is Macrobid mg x a day for days My advice is to take it with a full meal Only side effects I get is slight drowsiness and nausea close to the hours mark of my next dose Eat large meals before taking Macrobid and then snack throughout the day and drink lots of fluids Youll be ok
3124,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42788,6,My first day of being prescribed with the medicine I thought everything will be ok I took my first pill at pm at night when I finally got home from work everything seemed fine However at am I started getting serious abdominal pain and couldnt go to sleep I started throwing up and had diarrhea my body was so weak that I started crawling on the floor This have to be the worst pain ever and I refuse to take it again
3125,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42783,21,After days on Cipro my UTI did not clear up Pressure frequent urination and passing gas through my vagina yesFrontal fartingAnyone else have this Im on my th day of Macrobid and have not had any unpleasant side effectsJust some loose BM and gas
3126,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42783,15,I went to the ER and they determined I didnt exactly have a UTI but it was a possibility so they started me on Macrobid I had never taken it before Within two days I was hysterical I had such intense migraines that I fell multiple times and couldnt see straight My stomach was a mess I couldnt go to the bathroom I wanted to sleep but I couldnt fall asleep because my head was pounding too hard I called my PCP who checked the ER records and told me I had never had a UTI to begin with and to stop the Macrobid ASAP Once I stopped it the migraines went away I stopped falling my gastrointestinal system has now days later returned to normal
3127,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42783,14,Only hours after taking this medication for a UTI I had severe pain in my chest I thought it was gas and it wasnt until day four of having extreme shortness of breath and lethargy I decided to research what the side effects of this medication are It looks like many other people have experienced breathing issues as well from taking this I am stopping it asap and never taking it again
3128,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42779,4,Horrible horrible horrible I was prescribed this as I interact with most antibiotics It got rid of my UTI but I was sick had a degree temperature major shakes I still feel lethargic and sick so for me the cons outweigh the pros I did finish complete the course as it was only for three days had it been a seven day course I would have stopped taking them
3130,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42776,44,Both extremes of Macrobid are accurate Ive had a lot of UTIs to the point of having Macrobid prescribed with refills as needed I never experienced any symptoms and this stuff was like a miracle Took hrs to kick in and felt great I didnt get a UTI for years and then just got one I took Macrobid and it has made me feel horrible I feel weak have no energy am always dizzy have headaches diarrhea bad pain around my lymph nodes and always feel like I need to throw up Fortunately Im a sahm stay at home mom so Im able to deal with it at home but I had to have someone take my child to school because I couldnt get out of bed Also it feels like it hasnt completely started working So it can be great and horrible even with the same person
3131,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42776,3,My experience was HORRIBLE I was prescribed this medication for a UTI minutes after taking the first dose my mood changed for the worst I became extremely irritable and suddenly super hungry My appetite eventually went away completely but my irritability did not I went into a psychotic rage at one point when my mom was yelling for no reasonlike always typical mom and was provoking me and hadnt seen my texts of me telling her I was having a bad reaction so she didnt know Then before bed I felt like I was deathly ill my body was aching major headache chills racing heart I have anxiety so this medication caused my heart to race even more I then began crying uncontrollably and felt overwhelmingly sad Never taking again
3133,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42775,5,First off I have a history of having UTI This past one has been a real doozy and the medication was changed four times The last antibiotic prescribed is macrobid mg xday The first day I was nauseated and delirious with bad nightmares It was a sick flu like feeling along with bad chills I kept taking them as I thought what else This sick feeling calmed by third day and two more pills left I feel better but my bladder has been through too much with so many infections with wrong medications I really wish my Dr would focus more on preventionMacrobid definitely gave me bad side effects compared to any other antibioticsbut it seemed to clear the infection hopefully it doesnt return
3134,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,4,42773,16,Started nifurantoin on Friday After fifth dose started headache chills flu like symptoms Then severe low back pain and I thought this moved to my kidneys Took two more doses and went to my Dr on Monday with insane low back pain and joint pain down my body I thought maybe I had the flu When I told the nurse my symptoms she said quotits the medication your urine shows no infection now quot Dr confirmed and changed the medicine after telling me her patients that react this way look and feel like they have the flu Today is day five and I still have bad low back pain I wonder how long it will last because its horrible Drs should warn their patients
3138,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42770,2,Just taken of tabs really dont think can face another day feeling like death Husband woke me in the night to check temperature said I was panting He does not normally panic Cant eat If I sweat it stinks presumably of chemicals Splitting headache Extreme lethargy Basically went to bed and slept as much as I could Terrible stomach cramps belching and wind Best of all I dont even know if this drug is the correct one for me as lab results not back until Monday Never again for me
3139,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42767,4,Had ORANGE urine from to Went to Dr Got urinealysis They said it was fine and call them if it comes back It did every days or so for weeks Went back to the dr Got blood work and another urinalysis My blood is fine She said I have bacteria in the urine tho called it a UTI and put me on this medicine Only took doses so far and have no side effects but I urinated orange again twice today So Im wondering if it should be working by now And also like the other stories Im hearing from you ladies I have NO other symptoms Zero Has anyone had a UTI with no other symptoms Maybe its not a UTI And also has anyone ever had this orange urine but me When its not orange its fluorescent yellow
3140,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42761,8,years old and developed UTI after flu On the medicine for just days and will stopDeveloped scary pounding heart beat Need to stay around a while longer to see younger daughter wed
3141,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42760,7,I love this drug I have chronic UTIs I get them at least once a month the first time taking this medication I felt better within a day I did feel a little sick to my stomach but I would much rather feel a little nauseous than having the burning sensation and constantly needing to Pee every seconds I currently have a UTI now and I took with food and have not felt sick to my stomach whatsoever this medicine is a lifesaver
3142,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42760,6,I was instantly sick to my stomach after first dose Now I wonder if it was just exhaustion from being up all night with the PAIN I am on day and feel so much better that I may be back at work in the morning I havent had a UTI since I was very young and sort of forgot how dreadful it can get My Dr said usually hrs and one is over the worst and I think the side effects for me are extremely minimal
3144,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42758,6,Although I think I might have kidney stones instead of a UTI due to vast amounts of blood in my urine and no pain when I urinate my only side effect is nausea I cant say if it actually helped with symptoms because I still have side and belly pain after days of being on it Just because one person might have one side effect or allergic reaction doesnt mean the next person will Everyones body is different and what doesnt work for one person might work for the other
3145,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42755,5,I will NEVER touch this medicine again A couple hours after my first dose I started to feel nauseated Things quickly devolved from there Severe chills body aches fever splitting headache Like when you first get the flu X My skin hurt and I couldnt relieve my paindiscomfort in any way The next hours waiting for the drug to leave my system were a complete nightmare
3149,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,4,42748,9,Ive never reacted to any antibiotic so I had no idea what I was in for with this I made the mistake this morning day of taking pill I had no appetite yesterday and was very lethargic and agitated Really out of sorts but functioning Today has been a nightmare of nausea chills body aches and joint pain exhaustion headache ear and jaw pain etc Thats not the full list Doc pulled me off and moved me to Augmentin but I have a LOT going on the next days and I came here hoping to figure out how long it will be before the side effects are gone I cant get anything down nothing helps the pain Im essentially useless Also hasnt anyone heard of Pyridium You dont need to suffer OTC and numbs urinary tract
3150,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42746,16,Ive had a few UTIs recently and the antibiotics has worked every time but this time I was prescribed Macrobid and after one pill I felt pretty horrendous The symptoms of my UTI went away but it was replaced with really scary symptoms I took the second pill not thinking it was side effects considering Ive never had a bad experience with an antibiotic but woke up during the night feeling like my breathing was so heavy I wasnt sure if Id need to go to hospital The headache was unreal I ached all over and walked about feeling like I was going to fall down any minute and like I was drunk or something Called the doctor who told me to get an antihistamine and not take another I felt poisoned Still not fully recovered
3151,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42743,10,I suffer from recurring UTIs Its not uncommon with post menopausal women who are still sexually active This drug has been amazing Taking one directly after intimacy can prevent the UTI from occurring but when it does I feel relief after the first dose and in a few days its gone Since Im allergic to the standard treatment of sulfa based drugs Im grateful to have this Keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to any medication While one person tolerates it well another cant So dont dismiss it without trying I have never had the slightest side effect with nitrofurantoin
3152,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42742,19,It says ON THE BOTTLE to take this medicine with food This is probably why you are experiencing nausea and fatigue Its a great medicine and a great alternative and preventative if youre like me and suffer from chronic UTIs
3153,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42738,22,It has been my personal experience in dealing with urinary tract infections that Macrobid is a godsend After having my youngest child I came down with a UTI which stemmed from the birthing unit nurse improperly inserting a catheter prior to my cesarean section delivery Within about a week I began noticing some tenderness in my lower pelvic area but thought perhaps it was because I had a tubal ligation and c section and returned to work upon my discharge from the hospital yeah not the most health wise move but childbirth doesnt stop the bills from flowing in I was put on antibiotics that didnt work ended up admitted with severly infected kidneys and macrobid was the only thing that cured me and to this day is the only antibiotic that works for my UTIs
3155,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42737,7,On Christmas Eve I felt as though a UTI was starting and took Trimethoprim which I had ordered from an online Dr It seemed to dampen the symptoms but didnt get rid of them completely I was prescribed nitrofurantoin on New Years Day I was in a lot of pain Started taking the pills at am and had three doses during the day plus nurofen No improvement during that day but I slept well and woke up the following day today with very little pain Symptoms not completely gone but vastly improved No noticeable side effects Am taking the antibiotics with food as advised I give it a rather than because it has worked a little more slowly than treatments I have had in the past but I am not complaining
3156,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42737,4,Ive taken exactly pills and I will not take one more no fever or chills but I have a rash all over my body I have never been allergic to anything in my life and now this rash is horrible back legs arms stomach Its itchy and just plain annoying Also my urine had cleared up before taking these pills now its back to a very dark color I am not taking another pill as for my UTI I will try some parsley tea and see where that gets me
3157,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42736,20,I used to have many UTIs a year but no more with this drug I have taken it every day for years and have never had a sideeffect Sorry for those who do
3159,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42733,30,I have a history of UTIs and kidney infections because my urethra is abnormal However with every UTI i have been prescribed several different antibiotics None that are accompanied by side effects but every person is different With every UTI I have had I have always experienced head ache nausea body aches and fever All went away with the UTI When I asked my doctor he said the antibiotics take between and hours to start taking effect on your body You may be experiencing some effects of your infection
3160,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42731,23,I am only taking the time to write this review because I see so many negative ones Id hate to see someone not take it and risk an infection getting worse This drug does work cleared up my UTI in days There are some not pleasant side effects Nausea Ive been feeling this one all week body ache and chills only on the first day In my unique case Id take any pain in the world over having a strong urge to use the restroom every seconds and intense burning Ive taken this drug once before and felt fine Talk to the dr if youre concerned there are other medications out there
3162,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42725,11,Effectively killed bacteria but I had an extreme adverse reaction to the antibioticfever of headache body pains sore red rash on calves Adverse reaction developed after about days of taking medication the first time Adverse reaction developed several hours after taking st dose of medication the second time it was prescribed for me
3163,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42724,10,I was prescribed macrobid mg two times a day for days for a pretty severe UTI The first day I took it I felt like I had a fever and I had chills and body aches I figured it was just my UTI causing the symptoms Today I am on day last day and I am going to the doctors for a different medication because after taking one of the pills last night I developed what I thought was the flu severe body aches fever chills I really considered going to the ER cause I was that sick Woke up this morning feeling better then last night but I refuse to take another pill As far as cleaning up my UTI some days I have felt normal and other days I still have the burning and frequency
3164,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42723,29,Macrobid cleared up my UTI in only days I was afraid to use it based on the comments on this site but keep in mind most people who take time out to comment are those with negative experiences Usually people with great experiences like myself dont take time out to talk about how well a medication worksthey use it and go on with their daily lives Its been over a year now and no reoccurrence of UTI I had zero side effects
3166,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42722,3,After being in SEVERE pain on passing and after passing urine saw my GP who prescribed nitrofurantoin as Im resistant to the preferred prescribed Trimethropin After doses of mg same evening I woke in the night feeling like a total zombie felt like I could barely move or breath like I was almost comatose Carried on the next day tho as felt I would put this down to the infection in my body urine dip showed something I took every hours and feel snappy and lethargic but my main worry is the feeling of a fluttering racing heartbeat and pressure rising into my head I have felt a little short of breath too as if cant quite breath in Bladder still feeling sensitive and urgent even tho finished course earlier today
3168,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42716,11,The reviews on this site scared me so much so that I almost didnt take this prescription Ive only taken two doses so far and both times I took it with food but I have nothing strange to report No drowsiness no racing heart no headaches and I might add that headachesmigraines are very common for me Im already staring to feel some relief from my UTI symptoms I know everyone is different but Ive not experienced anything out of the ordinary this far
3170,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42713,8,I know a lot of people seem to have quite bad side effects however this was not the case with me I had been suffering so bad from a severe UTI went to the docs and got a prescription I took my first dose at am around pm that same day my severe symptoms were now non existent I continued taking the medication for days in total which is what my doctor advised and didnt have one side effect Maybe Im lucky but honestly this medication worked perfectly for me

3193,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42674,13,If I had seen this site before taking Nitro Id have chosen to avoid it However Im glad I didnt I get UTIs without fail every time I have sex sometimes I just got them for the sake of getting them or drinking too many fizzy drinks it got to the point it was almost constant I thought I was just cursed and that there was no escape and was debating urethral dilation with my Urologist However he recommend I try this before going any further It has changed my life I have no side effects and am free of UTIs as long as I take a pill post coitus the hassle of doing so doesnt phase me as it is nice to be able to enjoy my life with no risk of UTIs I recommend this to everyone who struggled like I did
3194,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42673,11,I was on holiday and prescribed these by the Dr at the walk in centre after a week I still have faint burning still urinating frequently coldflu symptoms headaches I rarely suffer with headaches sharp pains in my stomach and still feeling sick even after not taking them for days Back to my own Drs tomorrow This drug is horrid
3196,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42666,2,I have been talking nitrofurantoin for days and I have a severe stiff neck Is this normal
3197,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42665,10,I went to the doctor because of a slight UTI yesterday I took one dose of the medicine last night and felt nauseous and developed the worst migraine I felt it all in my face and neck I took extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep I woke up this morning perfectly fine and it was time for my nd dose in less than an hour I was soooo nauseous and weak and it feels like I have a lump in my throat This feeling keeps coming and going I called off from work because Im afraid if I start moving too much then I might pass out or throw up I normally never get side effects from medication but this one is different I dont recommend it at all
3198,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42664,25,I was diagnosed with a UTI and kidney infections They started me on Macrobid two days ago and yes death on a doornail set in When your body utilizes this drug to flush your system it doesnt just run to your bladder and ta da Your body handles this infection with all its defenses so you SHOULD expect to feel really icky for about a week I am floored at todays rush in society to get everything done right now or right away Every body needs time to heal and recover Allow yourself the precious gift of rest and recuperating it needs and unless you begin to spike fever or experience allergic reaction hang in there and know its okay to take some time off to nurture you
3199,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42664,16,I dont know why this medication gets such terrible reviews Im taking mg twice a day yellow and black pills second time theyve been prescribed to me and Ive never had troubles Mild gas mild urgency to use the restroom but nothing insane like heart racing or sweating I slept like a baby after I took my first one and Im about to take my second before my bed time now I honestly didnt know I had a UTI till my doctor told me but this is my second time and these pills have never given me an issue Take them as instructed with food stay hydrated too this medication works wonders Antibiotics are some of the only drugs I take as I believe in holistic approaches but this is one that makes me happy when I do have to take drugs
3200,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42663,18,The first time I used this medication it was great Just now I was prescribed Macrobid again It took care of the bladder infection symptoms in two days Next day fever was l headache Fever high only one day nausea fatigue high pulse stomach pain neck pain muscle pain lack of appetite Stopped taking this med after days and will never take it again
3202,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42659,22,I have suffered from frequent bouts of acute cystitis which have had me sitting on the toilet for hours in the middle of the night in tears The only thing which works to clear the infection is nitrofurantoin i find it works quickly and have never experienced any side effects other than my urine going slightly more bright yellowI am writing this because the other reviews are very negetive and could easily stop people taking this drug if i had read them i would probably not have taken the medication i do not doubt that some people suffer very bad side affects but that applies to all medication i would like to say that i really depend on this drug to cure my cystitis which would otherwise make my life very miserabletry them
3203,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42659,14,I have taken this on occasions over the last four years mg times a day for days and was scared to take it on each occasion after reading some of the reviews form others I also have a phobia of taking medicine which made me more anxious then mostI have always ended up taking it eventually because my symptoms worsened and would like to report I had zero side effects and felt better within days I also think that some of the reported side effects others have mentioned maybe the actual infection itself as I have left my infections for up to weeks without treatment and had the symptoms others have mentioned without me having taken the medicine
3204,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42659,5,After days out of twice a day I quit taking it for two days and then resumed once a day I had developed severe lethargy and dizziness and red splotches on my hands Weakness disappeared within a day but then returned when I resumed There must be an alternative out there
3208,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42655,16,I woke up feeling a nasty burning sensation so I went to the walk in clinic today to be prescribed with macrobin I must say in the first hour after taking it my extreme pain and irritation was gone but as time went by I started to feel like I was going through chemotherapy Only one pill and I feel extreme side effects I wear corrective lenses and my vision is getting all messed up My body is super weak my heart beats very fast my stomach is in knots my abdomen is cramping up like nobodys business I have a headache Never ever taking this again I would not recommend this antibiotic to anyone Yes everyone is different therefore you will react differently to antibiotics but this one is absolute agony
3209,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42654,8,This was prescribed to me a couple of days ago by a doctor for a suspected urinary infection as due to being pregnant i cannot take the usual antibiotic that would be prescribed ITS HORRIBLE I wish i had never taken it and have spent the last hrs tired and sick with nausea passing out diarhea blurry vision my body feels sick and poisoned I have no idea whats in this but its terrible and hasnt helped at all I am having shortness of breath just moving around is such a struggle Have stopped taking and will be going back to doc for something alternative when i can get up and actually get there safely without passing out Will never take this again

3211,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42652,11,I had a minor UTI I just couldnt seem to clear it out of my system so I got prescribed with Macrobid The first day I took it I felt a little drowsy but nothing major The second day dose two I began to feel very drained and had no energy I thought maybe I just needed sleep so I tried to nap but I just lay there in discomfort and exhaustion I began to have cold flu symptoms I became very dizzy and nauseous I felt like I was spinning I was bed ridden and cried from how bad I was feeling It did help my UTI symptoms but I am not sure if its worth it
3212,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42651,4,Had a mild UTI and was prescribed this drug I had no problem with the first dose and was feeling better by the second dose I took both with food Shortly after the second I was feeling dizzy and unwell Within a few hours I was severely nauseous and vomited I looked up side effects and read these reviews Although the drug did work quickly I chose to call my Urgent Care doctor and she prescribed a different drug Hope that one gets rid of the problem with fewer side effects
3213,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42648,21,I cannot overstate how much I despise this medication It may be effective in getting rid of bladder infections but I never got that far I used this medication twice I gave it a second go thinking my previous experience mightve been an anomaly Wrong Within days each time I had severe flulike symptoms They included chills mild fever muscle aches all over sharp pains in my stomach severe nausea vommitting pounding headache amp extreme fatigue I was told to take with a meal and drink lots of water I felt like I was drinking gallons a dayuntil I couldnt drink or eat anything without throwing it up I stopped taking the second time after pills and it took full days amp lots of Tylenol for my symptoms to subside
3214,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42646,12,Im allergic to sulfa and penicillin so my doc prescribed Macrobid The first time I took this medicine I felt fine besides some nasty nausea I didnt take the last pills because of it but my UTI went away almost immediately This time I feel horrible I felt good after the first doses but now after I take it rd day I am weak I feel like its hard to breathe and my stomach burnshurts so bad I cant stand it It also makes me very tired and out of itwoozy The burning during urination has went away but I feel worse than what I did with the UTI I hate to stop it early but I fear I may end up in the hospital if I dont Its not a bad med just hit or miss side effects I say try it out though Its worth that much at least
3215,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42646,14,First I noticed my computer screen got too bright and then I had to let less light into my room After One Week being on Macrobid I really got worried as every thing I normally could see such as my wall clock was blurry and I could not even see the numbers I saw my eye doctor and it was determined after many tests that Macrobid was really degrading my vision and it happened quite rapidly It took about a good full two weeks before I felt my vision was returning close to normal Yes when your vision goes bad one gets really shakenIf you notice that things start to get too bright after two days of being on this drug See you Doctor and fast I had a vision test two months later and I am happy to report all was once again well
3216,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42646,8,Will NEVER take this again I took this for three days and ended up being hospitalized for days A kidney biopsy was done and determined to be a sever reaction to the drug After the diagnosis I was in dialysis for weeks A very traumatic experience

3220,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42589,1,My month old daughter was recently diagnosed with her nd urinary tract infection With her st one the dr prescribed Sufrax oral suspension We didnt have any issue with it and it cleared up the UTI quickly This time she was prescribed Nitrofurantoin oral suspension She is exclusively breastfed but will take a bottle of breast milk if offered The Nitrofurantoin is so sweet that she wont take it from a medicine syringe or hidden in a bottle of breast milk Either way she spits it everywhere even if shes hungry My question is why TH would they add so much sugar First kids dont need the extra sugar nd you can add flavored sugary syrup at the pharmacy for if a kid wont take it otherwise Way to go idiots
3221,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42589,9,I was prescribed for a very painful UTI After days I felt no relief The th day I began to feel better but very fatigued The th day I developed a rash on my scalp I thought it was shingles I woke up the th day with extreme itching and discomfort The rash had spread to my shoulders and eventually down my chest and to my waistline I went to my doctor who took me off Macrobid switched me to Cipro for another round of antibiotics and prescribed a shampoo and topical ointment for the rash I wish I had changed antiobiotics that th day This is miserable red itchy welts everywhere and low grade fever
3222,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42587,6,Took the pills for days and it made me so much sicker fever migraine aches in my bones and complete exhaustion felt like I was dying Called my doctor and now trying ciprin
3223,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42587,18,Honestly I was pretty scared taking this medicine after reading these reviews but I took it and did not have one problem what so ever also cleared my UTI right up Started off taking bacterium and had The WORST side effects headache dizziness my body tingled Super sick so they switched me to macrobid for days and had no problems ate with a healthy meal ever time I took it and drank lots of water throughout the day Everyone is different so I guess I found the one that works best for me
3225,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42582,19,The first few doses made me feel like I had been hit by a truck Things improved and now I am in the third day and fine Burning urgency leaking GONE so I will finish my days of medication I had Cipro for days previously and after I finished in three days I had symptoms again
3227,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42580,4,Increased my anxiety gave me upper back pains terrible nausea and chills I do not recommend this if you are sensitive to medication I took it just in case for a mild UTI and definitely should have stuck with homeopathic methods

3229,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42580,15,Ive take this before with no side effects This time the doctor recommended me to take it for days milligrams once a day for recurring UTI By the second dose I am in the bed feel like I have the flu a virus at the same time and vision going Not going to take anymore of this microbid Wish I had only filled days of meds instead of day Spent to much money on something I cant take Take with caution
3230,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42579,10,Started four days ago with a UTI Started taking Nitrofurantoin MonoMac mg twice daily Ive been taking it am and pm for two days Today I woke up feeling absolutely horrible Burning clammy skin chills without fever bad pain in left side of lower back Pretty much cant get out of bed Ive had UTIs before and can still function These meds are risky Went to Doc this morning and he confirmed that its most likely this med Just wanted to put my review out here to help if someome might feel the same
3231,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42578,13,by end of day one doses I felt very tired Day two I woke up weak fatigued achey but was advised to stay on Macrobid as the UTI symptoms had improved As day wore on doses I became increasingly tired no energy headache sensation of heart racing nausea Another call to provider and they suggested I switch to Cipro Before I could do that an episode of nausea sent me to the bathroom I passed out hit my head and ended up hospitalized I would be very afraid of this medication considering the other options
3232,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42577,12,This drug is fine for me It makes me feel foggy tired and just out of sorts for a few hours but i can still function The headaches are the worst part Im on day so Im sticking it out
3233,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42577,10,I started taking mg of macrobid twice a day on Wednesday evening It is now Tuesday I have two pills left One for this morning and one for tonight I cant wait to be off this medication My uti symptoms were gone between day one and two but I was told to take all the medication even if it gets better I take this medication at am and pm From about pmpm I am extremely nauseous its horrible Then I also wake up off and on from am because of nausea I always take the pill with a meal so I dont know why Im still experiencing the nausea Thats the only bad side effect I have experienced so far Cant wait to be done with this medication
3236,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42572,4,Ive had a recurrent UTI for the past month and no other antibiotics had been working Doctor prescribed this one mg twice a day every hours for five days After my first dose my urgency to urinate had subsided a lot Nevertheless by the second dose severe nausea constipation and fatigue began I have been a zombie at work and just the thought of food makes me want to puke even though Ive been forcing myself to have at least three full meals a day particularly when I take the medication Have two more days to go and I just wrote to my provider to see if I MUST finish it The UTI symptoms are gone at this point yet the side effects are decreasing my quality of life by the minute
3238,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42569,26,Im on day so I have taken pills and I feel absolutely horrible nausea I have aches all over like the flu and pains in my stomach sharp ones I can barely keep my head up I am stopping them and going back to the doctor tomorrow I have never felt so bad also very explosive diarrhea Im thinking of going to the hospital I feel as if I have been poisoned
3239,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,7,42563,5,So I get constant bladder infections and honestly they ruin my life I have to take time off work which I dont want to do I sit uncomfortable for a good of my life its horrible I would take anything to stop constant bladder infections I have to say I have been on this tablet twice now last two times was g four times a day and it literally got rid of my discomfort in about two hours I had mild headache but never put two and two together But now Im on g twice a day and I read these reviews and like clockwork I felt instantly awful now more days off work its the worst but is it physchological Or is it because the change in dose I feel awful my head is foggy and I feel anxious tired and sick
3240,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42559,17,I am currently on day of macrobid x daily for days Pharmacist was sure to emphasize to take macrobid with food to prevent nausea So far I have no nausea but have developed a terrible headache I must say that pain of the UTI was gone within two hours of taking my first dose which is worth it to me So Ill be sticking this one out and hope the headache doesnt worsen
3241,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42559,47,After reading a lot of bad reviews I was hesitant to use macrobid as a treatment for a pretty severe bladder infection However I didnt experience many of the side effects that I read about Although it did make me rather fatigued I made sure to drink lots of water and took my pills with a nice healthy meal I also took my mg pills twice a day at the exact same time as to get my body on a routine Almost days off of it and feeling back to Would have no problem using this antibiotic again
3242,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,42558,16,I took this med once before and had the same symptoms so I dont think the first time was a fluke After taking just one pill within a few hours I was nauseous to the point I could not lay down My head started to hurt and then within in six hours I had body aches all over I also developed a cough and it was hard to breathe It has been over hours I am just now starting to feel a little better This medicine is awful Dont take it
3244,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42640,8,This drug should be banned from use Im in agony with cramp in my stomach Last night I thought my head was going to explode and Ive not been able to go out today Feel so low in mood tearful and lethargic
3245,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42639,27,I am weeks pregnant and ended up with my first UTI I was prescribed Macrobid because I am very allergic to Sulfa antibiotics which landed me in a hospital a few years back Upon reading the reviews I was so incredibly terrified to take this medication but I had no choice Ill consider myself lucky but so far I have found that Macrobid is actually quite tolerable Ive been a bit more tired and achy than usual and had some mild nausea but nothing too severe I have found that taking with a full meal is critical and drinking TONS of fluid waterGatorade helps with side effects But for me this is really a reminder to take reviews with a grain of salt you really have no idea how your body will react until you try it yourself
3246,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42637,74,I am finding it VERY hard to believe these bad reviews of MacrobidIm thinking these are the apple cider vinegar DMannose and cranberry juice people NONE of which cure UTIs I have been battling reccurent andor relapsing UTIs for a few years despite being celibate Up until now Bactrim worked yes it gave me a headache and made my heart race but it worked Then I tried monurol worked a few times expensive beyond then stopped yesterday I tried Macrobid first timeno side effects Had I listened to these reviews I would have killed myself before taking it It seems to be working It doesnt kill your gut flora Its considered one of the SAFEST of the UTI drugs All I can say is do not be afraid to try it
3248,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42634,12,Had a UTI and went to urgent care The doctor there put me on this medication and while it does work within a couple of days the nausea is so bad Ive been feeling so sick to my stomach since taking this medication I cant seem to focus on anything and the headaches are really bad as well I know others may have completely different experiences I am only sharing mine
3249,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42626,0,weeks pregnant got told I had a UTI I was prescribed this medicine take it every hours for days It did not work at all Still dealing with all UTI symptoms
3250,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,6,42625,20,Had bad stomach aches after taking the medication Also dizziness and nausea After a while the side effects lessened
3252,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42620,17,This medicine works like a dream No side effect what so ever I was taking augmentin and I hated it I asked for macrobid instead days and I was feeling a whole lot better

3414,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42320,7,Works great for getting rid of a UTI or as a prophylaxis for UTIs But the accompanying nausea is hard to bear I would have to take an antinausea pill at the same time along with a little food or I would not make it Best time is to take before bed

3421,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,4,42222,4,I was told to take this four times a day for three days but after taking just two I started having side effects The first day I had to go to bed as I had a throbbing headache upper stomach pain and feeling sick I have been advised to carry on taking it and have two tablets left While on this medication I have felt so so tired I have fallen asleep on the sofa midday a few times Not to mention a constant headache throughout Neon pee too which took me by surprise Cannot wait for this to be out of my system However my UTI symptoms have almost gone

3428,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42189,1,This did NOT suit meI was given mg twice a day After the first dose suddenly Blood Pressure and pulse rate shot up in a spike I have been having high BP and Pulse already So took those medicines and the parameters came down to normalSecond doze was in the night It didnt cause that trouble but after sometime started getting hot flushes However I tolerated that After taking the pill next day after lunch after say minutes heart started beating God damn fast This time the discomfort was times than the previous one BP and Pulse were even higher Took the pills for BP Pulse and double dose of tranquilizers to slowly pacify the effect I was about to be taken to ERGot to discard them
3429,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42188,35,I have reoccurring utis every couple months and I have taken every antibiotic Cipro and keflex did not work for me and bactrim I had horrible side effects Macrobid is the only one to cure my utis every time Of course it depends on which bacteria is causing yours
3430,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42185,52,I have been prone to utis for years I have been put on every antibiotic under the sun For me this is the antibiotic I would choose every time because it works and has minimal side effects The only side effect I have experienced is a headache I will take a headache any day over horrible bladder infection pain Also this antibiotic helps to clear up the infection within the first day of use which is a plus for me so I am not in pain as long I have taken cipro which made me throw up and cry bactrum didnt clear up my infection and monurol which made me very sick as well It is important to remember to make a quotpill sandwichquot with this antibiotic You eat a full meal take the pill and then eat some snacks after the pill
3432,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42182,12,This is terrible drug I took it for days and after I finished all of it I broke out in a bad rash had fever hurt all over Ive been off of it for over a week and had to go to Dr twice This should be taken off the market I just hope permanent damage was not done to my organs
3433,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42180,22,Macrobid has to be the worse medication I have ever took in my life It should be banned I got an extreme allergic reaction that lasted at least month I was put on prednisone and Zyrtec to stop my body from swelling I had red marks and rashes throughout my body even while on prednisone and Zyrtec after using marcrobid Initially I placed on marcrobid for a uti I took all prescribed pills One week after finishing the macrobid I experienced extreme swelling throughout my body I feel as if my body still never recovered from the reaction years later I recommend cipro over macrobid it is dangerous And should be banned
3435,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42178,8,Prescriped twice a day for days and it started working after the second pilli can say it has helped the condition greatly but I have been fatigued sleepy with some backache Have two days to go and cant waitit does get the job done so the side effects are worth it
3436,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42176,29,I have been taking macrobid for two days now and my UTI feels better but today I woke up with terrible back aches where my kidneys are located and pains on my front sides I have been so sleepy also today like cant even keep my eyes open with bad headaches

3439,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42163,14,Took first pill with no food No stomach upset Had mild chills st night min Feeling great on rd day No other side effects
3443,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42157,12,I gave this medication a for effectiveness because my UTI symptoms subsided completely after the second dose Im still taking this medication and have two and a half days left Since starting my doses I have experienced nausea extreme fatigue and muscle weakness shortness of breath sensitivity to heat and a loss of appetite I cant wait till its over After reading all the reviews it seems this medication makes everyone sick It did seem to clear up my UTI though which was worse than these symptoms but not by much
3444,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42309,17,I have been taking micro for days and I feel worse than the UTI my stomach hurts really bad heartburn is terrible and chest pain very bad gas pains all and all I feel like crap I stopped taking it and lets see if I feel better never again will I take this my neighbor took it and ended up in the hospital almost died

3447,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,3,42308,24,I had this tablet prescribed to me to take for three days twice a day to prevent bladder infection The tablet made me go yellowvomit lose my appetite and generally made me feel really bad I still have a bladder infection so I wouldnt recommend it
3448,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,3,42301,21,I took this medicine for a bladder infection and took it for the full five days prescribed The first day I felt immediate relief and reduced discomfort of about However with each day that followed my relief did not increase and within hours of completing perscription my symptoms were back by So either the dose wasnt strong enough mg or the prescription wasnt long enough No way of knowing if either or both of these conditions were changed I would have experienced more success with this particular antibiotic
3449,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42300,15,Im usually skeptical about these posts and the crazy side effects so I didnt take them seriously when I was prescribed this medication I only took doses and although my symptoms are gone I had the worst splitting headache Ive ever had intense nausea and foggy brainnot feeling myself I skipped my th dose and felt completely better within a few hours I felt worse on this medication than I ever did with a UTI
3450,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42300,22,After never having even a urine infection in my whole years after having a baby I got utis in months Keflex for the first That worked well Macrobid for the others It does make me a little drowsy and have mild sort of quothallucinationsquot but it does work for me quite well After the nd dose all of my symptoms are gone For me the benefit outweighs the side effects
3452,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42294,40,This works fine for me Im allergic to most of the antibiotics out there but not this one thankfully I get utis frequently because I always have to be cultured sometimes that waiting period helps the thing really get going Normally its a day course I do not get headaches or any of the side effects others have had Everybodys body is different the only way youll know how you will react is to take it yourself
3453,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42294,10,My mother is years old and took this for a bacterial infection that kept causing UTIs We have both taken many different antibiotic pills and medications over the years for various illnesses but never have I seen a reaction as bad as this one My mom was complaining of a headache and then she was so weak she could barely stand She had chills a fever and was curled up in a ball in bed for the next hours Now she has to go to the hospital and get an IV with a different antibiotic to treat the infection This drug is incredibly powerful and watching its effects was extremely scary
3455,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42292,10,Will never put another pill in my mouth Painful muscle aches fatigue nausea fever chills night sweats tired the list goes on I have been off it for days and the muscle aches and fatigue are still here Never never again
3456,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42291,12,Just came back from ER I have started doing self cath in severe pain frequent urination I have taken this med before many times for UTIs with excellent results doesnt usually cause yeast infections or c diff I cant believe all the bad reviews I never had any side effects at all just hope Im on right med waiting for culture results only took pill so far

3459,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42285,41,Ive been suffering from UTIs o amp off for the last year During this time I was prescribed a Sulfate antibiotic which I discovered I was allergic to within hours I developed hives amp blisters all over my face amp body So Cipro was prescribed every time for the UTIs that subsequently followed It seemed it took about days before the symptoms to go away but I never felt fully cured because even though the urgency and burning went away I was having a hard time holding my urine if I had a close to full or full bladder Then I would have about weeks of feeling ok only to have the UTI start all over again I was at my wits end I was prescribe Macro I felt relief in hours with absolutely no side effects I hope this is finally the end
3460,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42283,41,I have been suffering on and off with UTIs for about years now my mother and grandmother are prone to them and I see to have inherited that unfortunately and I mean SUFFERING My symptoms get to the point of missing work and making trips to the ER This past infection was the first time that I was put on Macrobid and I have nothing more to say than that it is a miracle drug Within hours of taking the first dose the urgency of needing to urinate had diminished tenfold On day two now fourth dose and all of the pain is gone I am on many more medications and the fact that my doctor could find an antibiotic that wouldnt interact with anything I was currently taking including birth control was incredible Will use in the future
3461,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42282,21,Had either a urinary infection or intestinal New to macrobid in one day after taking the medicine I ran a fever was nauseous and hurt all over Ran a fever off and on till I got off the med and started cipro Began noticing fatigue brain fog and constant headaches weeks later Ive been diagnosed with hypoxmia and am starting night time oxygen therapy Already have RA Sjogrens and Sarcoidosis didnt need this drug complicating my life Macrobid should be taken off the market
3462,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42279,21,was prescribed this medication for a UTI Never had this pill before OMGI was nauseous with chest pains and only took it for days Also gastro issues and feeling like you are in a fogI always got CIPRO for this type of E coli infection Dont know why my doctor gave me this horrible medicine Called today for different medication because I am not sure if the infection is cleared up Pain is gone but that is all Wouldnt recommend this
3463,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42277,3,Prescribed by doctor since I am allergic to sulfa meds Developed horrible mouth soreness that is so bad I cant drink or eat much like I was eating hot peppers Urine on treatment day hadnt changed
3466,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42275,8,I took this for a bladder infection It took hours for me to notice any improvement I am on day I had minutes of mild nausea one day but that was the only side effect Not as bad as others like doxycycline Surprised to find this didnt make my yeast infection come back or cause any other unpleasant side effects
3467,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42275,13,Was prescribed this for an ecoli UTI but had never received this in the past BAD choice of color of pill It forewarns issues Had what I thought was the flu this weekend Twelve hrs then the fever broke Did know know that flu symtoms could be a side effect Have had head aches top of head since beginning Now have vaginitis of some ilk Now dont know what route the Dr will suggest Worried in pain and not sleeping waiting for the drs office to open I will always put macrobid in my medical records as an allergy Took in generic form to keep costs down Still expensive and now must start over with another drug delaying both the cure of the UTI and causing the vaginal discharge
3468,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42274,68,Was so traumatized to take this med based on other reviews Im and quot and get sick and nauseous from even one tynenol regular strength I got pedialyte to prepare Took the pill and waited And NOTHING happened except my uti going away Do yourself a favor and dont read the Internet Trust your dr
3470,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42088,16,Prescribed this medication for urinary tract infection since I had cdiff last year and cannot take the stronger antibiotics right now Could tell difference in bladder pressure and pain within two days however dealing with the side effect of headache being sleepy and muscle aches makes me ready to get this all taken
3471,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42086,23,This medication made me feel awful I woke up everyday with a bad headache experienced nausea dizziness and extreme tiredness throughout the week everyday I dont think I can finish the full week as I need to resume my life I wouldnt take this again However the infection seems to be gone so it worked for that
3472,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42086,37,Made me sick Ran a fever and was very dizzy and disoriented for days
3473,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42085,4,Im and have had a number of bladder infections before however this time it was worse I was prescribed nitrofurantoin and only found it worked at helping ease my kidney pain but I still had a burning sensation when I urinated and also had pain in my lower abdomen which didnt clear when taking the tablets even for a few days after I had finished my prescribed dosage I found I was still in pain I would recommend for very minor and less serious infections
3474,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,3,42075,29,Havent had a UTI in probably more than years Have recently been diagnosed with in the last months Had Macrobid both times The first time I ended up with fever and chills but thought I was unlucky and had picked up a virus Symptoms went away by the end of the treatment When UTI came back I was given the same medication Within hours of taking the first does my fever and chills became so bad that I almost went to urgent care Advil reduced the fever temporarily but I wont take it again
3475,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42071,33,My third day on it no side effects and not having to the bathroom every hour I will definitely take it again
3476,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42071,20,Headache nauseous on day one left arm tingling day Nightmare and neck pain day and more days to go
3477,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42070,13,I took my first pill of macrobid last night and it caused nausea and it made me exhausted I noticed when I was nauseous I felt better if I ate something Its like I constantly needed something in my stomach but I felt miserable I also had chills so Im guessing I had a fever Im about to eat a heavy breakfast and take my next pill hopefully this second dose goes okay Otherwise my doctor is getting a phone call first thing Monday morning
3478,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42064,53,Third day on it and I feel like I have the flu but without respiratory symptoms Tired muscle aches headache dizziness nauseated Still better than having to pee painfully every ten minutes
3479,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42063,27,It made me very sleepy and dizzy I also got chest pains and it made my heart race My urine was also a very bright almost neon yellow color I stopped taking it after it days and then I was fine And I always took it after I ate The one time I took it on an empty stomach I vomited and was nauseous for a few hours
3480,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42048,63,After reading the reviews of Macrobid I was terrified to take it As a person with severe acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome I was scared that I would have all these terrible experiences that people were describing However all of my doses were taken with a COMPLETE meal and I did not suffer from any side effects except for a slight headache
3481,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42044,38,Tried this medication several times and was not effective UTI had only worsened Side effect of diarrhea also
3482,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42043,5,I was given Nitrofurantoin as two previous antibiotics hadnt helped to shift my kidney infection I take a day for days and Im halfway through my suggested dose I have improved being on this medication but I cant feel the benefits as the nausea vomiting and tiredness are too severe too notice the change I feel constantly sick and occasional vomiting and extremely tired I think its the side effects of the tablets I have barely been out of bed for a week I hope to pick up soon
3483,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42037,68,I was prescribed this based on my symptoms and prior to the lab results coming back My first dose was at pm and the second at am By lunch the blood in my urine was gone and the pains were subsiding I took as scheduled with no side effects and when my cultures came back it was confirmed a bladder infection This medicine is fantastic
3486,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42022,50,Ive been on this medication more times than I can remember and it always works wonderfully The only side effect is some sleepiness but make sure to drink enough water and have a little caffeine
3487,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42022,58,It is the only antibiotic that works for my urinary tract infections and I havent ever had any of the side effects I generally feel better already after the nd dose
3488,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42015,49,Dont take on an empty stomach Always works great for me
3491,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,41988,11,It doesnt work for me one bit
3492,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,41980,74,At first it wasnt working but the closer I got to finishing the pills it was clearing up I made sure I ate before I took the pill to avoid getting sick It made me extremely sleepy though
3493,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,41948,35,Taking mg xs daily for urinary tract infection On day of with limited side effects I have a severe allergy to many medications but thankfully no severe reaction to this one I noticed the nausea is alleviated if you drink a full oz glass of water with each dose and continue drinking water throughout the day I work long hours so not sure if the drowsiness is caused by the medication or not Some vaginal itching and discomfort but so far no vaginal infection Doctor recommended I eat yogurt daily while on this medication and I am following doctors orders I have felt some dizziness but it isnt constant
3495,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42268,3,Dr gave for UTI and mg twice a day for days first day took oneand night had terrible pain in the stomach next day took and that nightmy throat swelledthat was it and I read the side effects I had twothat was enough for me since I had spent three nights in ICU at hospitala couple of years earlier for swollen tongue from allergic reaction to Lisinprol forblood pressureI did not want to take that kind of chance I am sure there is other medicine out there but he felt I didnt give it a chanceIt looks like you can have different reactions at different timesmeaning it doesnt bother you one time you take it but it can the next time side effects deadly
3497,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42264,5,This was effective in treating my UTI Mine started on a Wednesday I went to see my GP on friday I was diagnosed with a mild UTI and I started taking nitrofurantoin mg from Friday evening The only reason I deducted stars is because it took days to ease the pain and some side effects like nausea during afternoon and mild discomfort while sleeping after taking this pillI took plenty of water and used to take the dose on time for days
3498,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42263,5,Do not take this medicationI feel as if I have poisoned myself I was prescribed to take one pill twice a day for days After the nd dose I began vomiting and had an awful pounding headache I called the doctor to ask if I could be given something else and he said no and to continue taking the medication After the rd and th dose I am not taking it anymore I feel nauseated constantly my body aches and I feel like I am sick and the worst part is my chest hurts really bad I have a constant painpressure in the center of my chest and if I laugh or cough it feels like my entire chest cavity hurts I have read that is one of the more serious side effects and its freaking me out How can an antibiotic make your chest hurt like that
3499,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42257,24,I was prescribed this medicine for a bladder infection and would never recommend anyone to take it Obviously it depends on your body type but I usually have a high tolerance Im needing to head to the doctors now because Ive been experiencing painful headaches everyday sharp stomach aches muscle pain chills hot to brutally coldfever type symptoms tingling light headed nauseous eye aches my urine went from neon green to dark brown and as gross as it is I havent been able to take a proper poo but every time I pass gas on the toilet watery diarrhea like stuff comes out and Ive seen some blood when I whipped This medicine definitely didnt go well with me and is a painful experience
3501,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42250,9,This medication was prescribed for a UTI I was given capsules to be taken a day for days The WHAM hit me shortly after the first pill Within hours I became totally lost I shook with chills my head pounded with a horrible headache my eyes just wanted to stay closed and I spent a very unrestful night When I had to go to the bathroom or to get water I dizzily stumbled into furniture I had absolutely NO appetite but made myself eat enough to take three more pills before I QUIT The list of possible side affects on the package read like a checklist of my issues I realize each person can experience different sideaffects but I think any responsible doctor should discuss these before prescribing DO NOT EVEN TRY
3502,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42250,6,Im one of those female twenty somethings that always have UTI issues and most antibiotics make me nauseous but this one is nausea plus maybe like a little headache Like the kind you get if you dont drink enough water but like whatever It normally kicks in after days or so
3503,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42247,15,The only side effect I had from this medication was diarrhea and frankly I will take that over having to urinate every mins It took days to get relief and I may ask for another round just to make sure its gone since I am going on vacation soon I realize I had a really bad infection and maybe thats why it didnt work right away I did not get a yeast infection yet which shocks me because I am diabetic and get everything like that
3504,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42246,17,Almost died Severe lung scarring and severe hypoxia saturation months of continual oxygen fortunately I recovered
3507,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42241,3,I take this medication with food per the instructions I was given yet I do experience a very very severe headache with this medication that does not get better with pain medication such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen I even tried my Sumatriptan that I normally use for migraines hoping it would help but it very sadly did nothing for my headache The severe headache is the only symptom that is really a big issue for me and otherwise I find this medication very effective I just wish there was something I could do about the head pain as it is very difficult to get through the day with a throbbing migrainelike headache that cannot be treated with any type of pain medication
3508,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42240,5,Im I day of this medication Its pretty good at clearing up the UTI but it does have some side affects Ive had pain on my left lower stomach towards pelvis for many days off and on It feels almost like cramps I also have had a tingling tounge and possible thrush though hopefully notsymptom havent progressed I cant take a lot of abx so Im thankful that this has worked but looking forward to being DONE
3509,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42238,6,Stomach pain nausea feel like could get sick after complete doses shortness of breath chest pain
3512,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42231,5,I took this medication for days I feel like it cured the UTI but ached the entire time while taking it Approximately days ago had severe pain in my left hip Hip feels better now but have fingers on right hand that are swollen and feel like an extremely bad sprain Now having the same pain in my left hand My neck is stiff and hurting as well as my back Have to take Ibuprofen around the clock I am just hoping that the pain will start subsiding now that I have been off the antibiotic for hrs
3514,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42230,3,I took one dose and I felt nausea the next night I took a second dose and woke out my sleep and my tongue had swollen up I had to be rushed to the hospital but the UTI went away serious terrible scary situation never again
3515,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42229,6,I dont do the best on any medicine Ive fought UTIs for years Im pregnant and was terrified to take another medicine But UTIs can be serious and the pain I was in was horrific Im on mg x daily for weeks no issues Day Urine is neon but UTI had it discolored anyway No issues so far Minimal headache could be from the other infection I have too and no discomfort Im pleasantly surprised This is working well for me and my medical needs
3516,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42228,3,Horrible I tried this once and it worked Second time allergic reaction rd time my Dr prescribed it anyway and I almost died Woke up after nd dose unable to breathe Fever of Bone and muscle pain Crushing chest pain Blue hands Swollen tongue and face Rash all over body This is the worst drug out here Do not use Macrobid Its a nightmare
3518,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42226,1,A horrible drug Macrobid should be banned I feel weak and I have had two anxiety attacks because of it Im super tired and depressed I am sensitive to antibiotics anyways I called CVS and they told me to continue it Ummm hell no Whether you take it with or without food it is horrible for your body I felt pins and needles in my back from this on the third night Buhbye
3520,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42152,11,Im on day two of taking this I have had very mild side affects Slight headache and sort of feel tired and out of it for a little bit but it seems to go away I have not had the bad side affects that others have mentioned and always take it with some food and have been drinking lots of water to flush my system out Everyone is effected differently by meds If you have not had this antibiotic before then I would not let others reviews scare you If you have problems after taking it then call and talk to your doctor about it Even though the pharmacist said I could drink alcohol moderately I plan to stay away as that could aggravate the side affects and it also dehydrates you which will do nothing but aggravate a UTI
3521,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,7,42151,8,I have taken nitrofurantoin before from different manufacturer and Ive never had symptoms as I have now while taking Macrobid I constantly feel nauseous the temperature keeps rising I also have symptoms like cold nose is congested voice is cracking chest is heavy and sometimes painful At times its hard to breath However I felt better after just capsule so at least the pain of UTI has gone One problem down and I hope all of the above will disappear as soon as I finish the course
3522,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42151,8,Was prescribed this for uti and started feeling nauseous after the second tablet by the second day I was vomiting and struggling to keep even fluids down Was getting cold sweats and just feeling generally unwell Went back the drs and they changed antibiotic Also dr retested urine and infection was positive Didnt do a thing for me just made me feel awful
3525,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42148,40,Rx paperwork does not say Take with Food even tho it is very important to do so My UTI symptoms were gone after taking the first pill I only have to take it for days but I am experiencing some side effects I feel achy and very sleepy Just have no energy in general I had diarrhea after the first dose but not terrible I just dont want to get out of bed I still rated this med a because it did take away my UTI symptoms almost immediately Just remember to eat a full meal before each dose and it makes all the difference in the side effects Two pills to go I can do this
3526,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,42148,14,Started having symptoms of UTI called my Dr and they sent in an rx I started taking it Friday morning That evening I didnt quite feel right Took my second dose before bed on Friday Saturday was the worst day of my life I took my third dose that morning even though I was feeling pretty rough I didnt think it was the nitrofurantoin monohyd macro mg Every joint hurt From my ankles to my neck I had shortness of breath splitting headache and a fever Chills that became sweats I slept in a puddle of sweat The sheets are soaked My fever went from and spiked at I woke up on Sunday feeling much better When I looked up the side effects on this drug I stopped taking it
3527,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,42147,23,my daughter was put on Macrodantin to prevent kidney infections and after months was struggling to breath while playing football tests showed that her pulmonary function had reduced by and she had developed an irregular heart beat I would think carefully before taking this drug as you may be damaging your lungs to save your kidneys
3528,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42143,10,This medicine started to work from day one which was a huge relief I took it immediately after main meals with a full glass of water and drank lots of water during the day and had no stomach issues with it whatsoever It had some unpleasant side effects headaches most days wooziness tiredness in the evenings and some weird ones neon yellow pee but it also was effective against a really nasty UTI Id take it again if the condition returned
3531,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42130,32,First day worked fine although will say my pee was neonwasnt expecting that Second day however tired all of the time with a killer headache that doesnt seem to go away and very cold and achey Good that I can finally sleep after three nights of not being able to great bank holiday that was and pain went after the first two tablets were taken This is the second time ive been on these would definitely take again
3532,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42130,54,Taking Macroboid has saved my life I have been prone to UTIs since I was sexually active and have had bladder infections by whole life I have tried everything from Cipro makes my feet swollen to Bactrum doesnt cure amongst many others I was very surprised by the other reviews so felt the need to write one because it has been the best medication to help prevent me from getting another UTI as long as I take food with it I am fine
3533,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42129,13,Developed interstitial lung disease and hypoxia
3534,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42125,21,I started this medicine for my UTI I always ate a meal with this pill I really did not experience any sickness I was on it for days I have trouble anxiety but it was not too bad but it seemed like this medicine made me more anxious at times then on my last few days I felt a little weird at times then on my last day taking the medicine I woke up with my throat scratchy then by evening I had a fever and bad chills I didnt take the last pill because I felt so bad my head kinda hurts too I dont know if its this medicine for sure or if Im catching a virus
3535,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42123,11,I decided to do some research to make sure that I was prescribed the correct thing I had never heard of an antibiotic starting with Nitro After reading the scary reviews I contacted my doctors office and they assured me they have multiple patients that have been prescribed it and with good results I was prescribed pills a day for days and I wouldnt even know I was on it other than a change in the color of my urine I feel completely normal and have no side effects and it is getting the job done I felt better after one day
3536,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42122,40,Prescribed macrobid for a UTI I took my first pill last night with rice and bread felt fine Woke up this morning to get ready for work and had to sit down in the shower I got so nauseous Couldnt even finish washing out my shampoo and had to lean over the toilet because I thought I would throw up Held it in and almost passed out walking back to my bed Slept another three hours then got up to try to make toast and got too nauseous and dizzy to even wait on the toaster The UTI already feels much better after one pill but I have never felt so miserable am missing work and have called my doctor to try to get off this medication
3538,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42115,14,I have a longstanding history with urinary tract infections I was getting them x a month and one instance it was so bad I even went to the ER At that point my doctor prescribed nitrofurantin mg as a preventative method which works However this time around when she prescribed it to treat a UTI mg x a day for days it was one of the worst medication experiences ever The side effects were TERRIBLE I have never experienced such bad nausea in my life I had splitting migraines could barely open my eyes amp felt like I was going to vomit Lasted the entire day in waves I also took on a full stomach with water and it still didnt help Also only slightly dimished UTI symptoms the first day providing moderate relief
3539,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,42111,34,This is the second time I have been prescribed this drug and it has done nothing but prolong my pain There has to be something better than this for UTIs it was not a shock for me to see all of the low reviews on it
3541,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42105,19,Every single time my doc prescribes this I beg for something different The side effects for me start right after the first dose and continue to get worse Extremely nauseated splitting headache muscles aching especially in my neck dizziness loss of appetite and just an all over feeling of being sick My daughter just came over to help take care of me and just named several other medicines that are very effective for bladder infections without the side effects
3543,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42096,37,On first day severe nausea headache and vomiting Couldnt get out of bed and had to stop taking
3544,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42093,20,I had flu like symptoms when I first started taking it Now every morning Im throwing up The urinary tract infection is getting better but this medicine is awful
3545,Arnuity Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,9,42700,10,My Dr gave me this medicine as a trial when I was diagnosed with adult onset asthma I tried Qvar first and that gave me chest pain and tightness This medicine had no side effects at all and worked great The only downfall is my insurance doesnt cover this so I have to switch to something else
3547,Altabax,Impetig,10,41185,8,Used free sample Will get some next time I get impetigo in the same recurring spot I have had it my whole life Altabax worked better than any other antibiotic cream Ive tried

3549,Altabax,Acne,9,40685,4,Hi I get pimples on my face nose area especially I use Altabax when I first detect any sign of pain under the skin If I catch it early enough it dries up overnight If I catch it after the pimple has a chance to harden a bit under the skin it takes longer If I waited too long Ill go for the Doxycycline too
3552,Altabax,Acne,8,40366,2,I was prescribed this after not having luck with Duac to treat and prevent adult acne It took about a week of twice daily application before I noticed a change I have been using it for over a month and it has completely cleared one problem area It appears that other areas around my neck are now being affected but I think with continued use it will also cure those problems and prevent further breakouts
3554,Altabax,Impetig,8,40323,7,Only day one but I think its starting to work But I had to write in this medicine STINGS like crazy on any type of open sore Takes an hour or so to calm down It works great

3618,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42011,31,Expensive but worth it My uric acid was in the range and I was having several severe gout attacks every year I tried allopurinol but didnt work so started on Uloric mg about months ago Had a few minor attacks during the first months but since then I can eat or drink anything and doesnt cause any flashes Doctors office just called and the uric acid level was
3622,Febuxostat,Gout,10,41570,58,I have had Gout since I was I am now I tried everything and nothing seemed to work My body would not accept Allapurinol no matter how long I stayed on it it caused bad flare ups Uloric has been a Godsend I almost forgot what it was like not to be in bad pain everyday My uric acid level is now down below and I take mg of Uloric daily I reccomend Uloric to anyone that has gout A truly great medicine that is priceless to me
3623,Febuxostat,Gout,10,41499,49,I have had the gout since I was am now I took allipuronol mg for many years it worked My doctor has changed me to Uloric for about months and have had no side effects my blood tests are well in range I am very pleased with this
3624,Febuxostat,Gout,10,41409,37,Ive been on Uloric for about years now Have NOT had flareup since and its also lowered my uric acid level in my blood Ive been on the A amp C meds for gout and they did nothing to help Uloric is a miracle in my opinion Very happy with it They also have a discount coupon for it which will lower what you pay for it
3625,Febuxostat,Gout,7,41120,42,I started mg Uloric about weeks ago just to lower my Uric Acid level which was over I had no symptoms within two weeks my uric acid level was around which is great however I had a flare up and it has not gone away for the past two weeks I am on Indomethacin and Prednisone it helps but I was just told not to take them together but the Indomethacin is hard on the stomach It is expensive but the makers of Uloric do have a coupon that helps with the cost
3626,Febuxostat,Gout,8,40865,55,I have taken Uloric for about years now and has done very well at controlling my gout I originally started with the mg pills but still had minor attacks about once a month My doctor increased my dosage to the mg and I no longer have attacks The price is way to high
3628,Febuxostat,Gout,9,40367,67,I have been using Uloric mg x a day for just about months It has been working very well but I was off it for two days and pain started up quickly again in my toe and hand joints Went back on it and is working again Colchicine works but the diarrhea is terrible Also my uric acid level was just above at start but now is very low and normal
3630,Febuxostat,Gout,8,40110,68,I started using Uloric mg on My uric acid was Blood work done it was down to BUT I developed a rash on one side of my face cutting back to mg every other day and using an ointment to see if the rash improves Couldnt tolerate any of the other medicines available for gout
3632,Onzetra Xsail,Migraine,10,42915,1,I was having my followup appointment with my neurologist and she gave me a sample of this because the oral tablets were not working and the nasal solution was taking a while to work for me This was my miracle drug for me one evening I felt my migraine coming on and I tried my sample pack I was very nervous about blowing something up my nostril but this wasnt bad at all and within minutes I could feel my headache start to calm down I did not have to go into my dark room I am really impressed and you dont taste the medication going down your throat as much as you do with the solution Thank you
3633,Onzetra Xsail,Migraine,1,42763,4,Went to see my neurologist for usual migraine check up med refills treatment While there he suggested Botox another story DO NOT DO IT I am in horrible non stop pain since I was in the middle of an episode I got a Toradol injection and this NEW Onzetra Nasal Not a fan of anything going up my nose should have went with my gut instinct You put one opening in a nostril the other in your mouth and blow Like blowing up balloon blowing powder through out your nose soft palette and throat It felt like sucking salt water up your nose the pain was immediate eye watering dizzying nose pinching nauseous pain I coughed gagged cried wanted to scream days later am worse than ever pain shaking incapacitated Not worth it
3634,Febuxostat,Gout,10,43061,0,My uric acid was after use Uloric went down to Ive had no attacks after started taking Uloric I stopped taking it and the uric acid went up but the pain was still coming back not exactly gout attack but I know the kind of pain on my joins so I started to take it again Now after taking mg regularly Ive got no pains or attacks No side effects good medicine but the price is just too high
3635,Febuxostat,Gout,1,42965,3,I started on uloric due to having an allergic reaction to allopurinol Well the nd day on it I broke out in a small rash not very noticeable and the rd day I have a burning painful rash all over my body My face started swelling and the slightest touch feels like someone is ripping my skin I was told to stop immediately and now its the wait game for the reaction to go away now
3636,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42941,0,Been taking Febuxostat for months or so Prior to doing so I had major agony gout attacks every two weeks First year the tablets activated all the stored crystals and I was in agony but not as frequentanyway I stuck with it and have had minor not too painful attacks in the last monthsafter yrs I should have cleared all the joints and wont have any further attacks Im running and in the gym for the first time in nearly years so feel better all round Stick with it is my advice The only downside has been a reduction in libido but Ill take that over the agony of gout
3637,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42892,5,My doctor told me for a few years that I would have to take a pill everyday for the rest of my life to avoid it I refused and fought it off with the regular pills when it flared up After struggling with gout for several years it had reached a chronic condition leaving me on crutches every other week It had become so bad I thought bones were breaking Turns out it was just even more intense gout attacks Finally I raised the white flag of surrender and agreed to take a pill everyday for the rest of my life After some research I decided on Uloric I have been taking one pill a day every day for the past years and I have not had a single gout flair up
3638,Febuxostat,Gout,4,42883,5,I have been on Uloric for the past months I have taken a pill every day mg with colchicine Unfortunately my attacks have become more frequent and more severe My doctor keeps saying I will get better but I am running out of patience and plan to go to a different doctor and possibly a different drug I need an honest second opinion it does not help that my Rheumatologist is closing his practice due to an impending lawsuit
3639,Febuxostat,Gout,5,42881,4,I have been on mg Uloric with colchicine for the last months I used to get attacks about once every months while only taking colchicine now with Uloric I get an attacks almost every month It took about months for my purine levels to fall to a normal range but still attacks I am saddened by the results My doctor says to continue and he expects it could be another year before I dont get attacks I dont believe him and am seeking a second opinion My attacks typically are in my feet and last to days I presently have a rare attack in my knee and I can hardly walk without severe pain I have an insurance plan that basically covers this
3640,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42870,6,Went on Uloric about years ago cleared gout up quickly but after months quit due to cost Have found that Gout attacks are too much to handle so have gone back on Uloric But have found that in Mexico you can buy the same drug for per month Thanks US healthcare
3642,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42848,3,I had gout for years and allergic to Allopurinol Overall my gout has been poorly managed Last year I had back to back debilitating attacks Radically changed diet with zero effect over many months Researched BP meds and was taken off Ramipril Immediate reduction in flare ups but UA still to After going onto mg Febuxostat UA was within days Took Colchicine during months As predicted had flare ups when starting as UA came out of joints With the worst ever gout attack Now all is fantastic and taken up exercise again My arthritic knees even seem better Dont know if this is coincidence Fortunately in UK this medicine is free on national health
3644,Febuxostat,Gout,8,42693,7,initial use caused flare up Regular use has been very effective at preventing flare ups Side effect for me is that although it doesnt seem to be be the cause of rashes it seems to exacperate an reoccurring eczema like skin condition on my hands Stopped use of Uloric to see if skin condition on hands would improve and the eczema was less severebut then I had a gout attackNo cost to me in Canada with a benefits plan
3645,Febuxostat,Gout,3,42558,11,Over priced medicationsProbably government sponsored at tax payers expense and then billed for profitShould be bucks for days
3646,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42523,21,Was diagnosed with Chronic Gout in early after over a decade of periodic attacks Suffered for straight months when subscribed Uloric As one should be quotgout freequot for some weeks before taking having Chronic gout wasnt possible so started off along with Cochicine Over years later Have never had another gout attack and best of all I can eatdrink whatever I want again Even Shrimp and Beer that were the worst causes for attacks My doctor commented he has never seen such dramatic drop in Uric acid levels in my blood tests although not many patients he has uses it due to the cost not all insurance companies may cover No side affects that seem apparent Life changing for the better
3649,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42399,17,Ive had gout and now tophus gout for years My UA is normally With Uloric Probenecid and Colcrys the combination of all three meds brings the UA down to great for getting rid of the tophiHaving a lot of insurance problems as they will not approve Uloric They keep saying that they have not received the doctors faxes though we have proof that they have received them etc so much for coverage of the elderly
3651,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42323,15,Still have short flareups of gout but less painful and pain only lasts a few hours
3653,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42232,27,Suffered for years Uloric a life changing drug No flares for the last years One mg tab allows me to eat and drink anything I want Blessed with Cadillac health coverage day supply only Would gladly pay anything for this type of relief Tophi build ups completely dissolved
3654,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42197,19,Started taking uloric after allopurinol gave me neuropothy in my feet and kept me up at night First drug to get uric acid below so happy doctor Im and have only had major gout attacks and never want to experience that again The expense has driven my drug costs into the quotdonut holequot and cant use the discount card due to the many restrictions Way to expensive but dont want gout again
3655,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42173,0,Smoother than alloprinol Long term side effects still not known but works very very well
3656,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42075,6,Had my first ever Gout flare in Since then had about attacks till but uric acid was always more than some times more than In I got flares in a year Thats when I started Febuxostat Worked like a charm Im taking mg daily Uric acid is maintained at mgdl since then I was drinking water like crazy before to maintain uric acid didnt help Now Im careless about water intake still uric acid levels are fine My doctor is very data driven so we took baseline SGPTSGOT liver enzymes test before starting the medication Measured uric acid and liver enzymes again after month and then after months No side effects on liver enzymes but uric acid level went down drastically So I love it
3657,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42069,30,Suffered for a few years with painful gout attacks Tried a few different things but nothing really worked for me A doctor had a trial bottle of Uloric mg and it changed my life It did take a couple of months before it brought my uric acid levels down and the attacks stopped In fact it was probably worse for the first month But I stuck with it and turned the corner I can now enjoy all the foods I used to eat without the consequence
3658,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42061,27,Worked well had attacks times a year bad ones Havent had an attack in years but really messed with my mind My dreams became so vivid and colorful fall asleep too quickly now Hard to wake up Starting to worry about memory loss so am going to switch out for awhile doctor agreed

3716,Fioricet,Headache,9,42418,34,I have received great relief from this medication It says discontinued because the acetaminophen dose has been lowered to MG per tablet It IS still available Great medicine for headaches Take with food though
3717,Fioricet,Headache,10,42390,14,Good
3719,Fioricet,Headache,10,42378,37,This is an old medication that I hope will never be removed My grandfather used to take it when it wasnt a prescription My father took it and I take it It kills the headache with just one dose within minutes Sometimes I may get sleepy when it takes effect but I also believe this happens due to the possibility that I hadnt slept well and is why that particular headache came on When I first started taking fioricet I did feel some light nausea and dizziness but I do not get those side effects any more I also am sure I eat a couple of saltines when I take it I have been on many other medications for my headaches and have not had the possitive results that I get from the fiorocet
3720,Fioricet,Headache,10,42365,34,I get migraines out of days This is the only medicine I have found that works so well I get sick my head pounds horribly like someone if hitting me hard with a bat
3721,Fioricet,Headache,9,42318,21,Have been prescribed this for plus years for migraines I only have them a few times a year and as long as I take fioricet as soon as I start getting the visuals before the migraine pain kicks in then the migraine is not bad at all The headache is very light if at all as well as the nausea
3722,Fioricet,Headache,10,42317,50,Ive taken this medicine for nearly years for debilitating migraines I am not addicted to Fioricet I do not get rebound headaches When the pain is gone its gone I have bad arthritis in the neck causing a combination of migraine and cluster migraines Ive taken every possible anticonvulsant combo and tried all kinds of migraine relief drugs and OTCs Nothing takes the pain away like Fioricet I take zonsiimide as a prophylactic now along along with Fioricet as needed The frequency of headaches have decreased with age but nonetheless still occur Fioricet will now not be covered by insurance company This is appalling Really Because of what Addicts Why are we penalizing those who need it by making them pay full price
3723,Fioricet,Headache,7,42226,29,My doctor prescribed Fioricet as a firstline treatment for my headaches Im still not sure whether theyre migraines tension headaches or something else but they always happen during my period Fioricet definitely works albeit with some side effects I react poorly to sedative drugs like butalbital in that I get awful rebound anxietydepression after only a couple doses All the more reason to use this medication sparingly Theres a definite euphoric effect that lends itself to abuse The combo of caffeine a sedative is a strange one but it works when all OTC stuff has failed I much prefer it over something like Topamax
3725,Fioricet,Headache,5,42185,21,Was prescribed this for tension headaches It does something but it makes me dizzy and light headed It seems to start working nearly immediately reduces the pain by like but after not too long the headache will start slowly creeping back over the course of the next few hours I actually have a headache Ive been attempting to treat with it right now and so far Ive taken pills over the course of hours and its still here
3726,Fioricet,Headache,1,42182,15,I had a spinal tap recently and unfortunately was in the small percentage of people that have spinal headaches from this procedure Ive had migraines forever but a spinal headache is by far the most debilitating experience I was prescribed fioricet and was taking every hours it did nothing I was back hospitalized the next day So this may work great for migraines but anyone prescribed this for spinal headaches it does not work
3727,Fioricet,Headache,10,42146,27,This Rx works wonderfully I love that it doesnt make me jittery or nauseous It works of the time for me Luckily I was able to have my tablets coated having a migraine and the bitter taste of the pill wasnt a very good mix There are times when I have a migraine that comes in too strong and too fast and this tablet doesnt workThats when I take my Maxalt Although I hate the after affects of Maxalt
3729,Fioricet,Headache,10,42093,35,I have suffered from migraines for as long as I can remember Tried everything then my Dr Gave me Fioricet and I love it gets rid of migraines when Im out I will use Ibuprofen as I AM a recovering Addict and dont want to rely solely on this medicine to get rid of headaches No more ER visits for this chick
3731,Fioricet,Headache,10,42065,41,Like many others have suffered from tension andor migraine headaches since I was a child age or so My mother and father both had histories of tension andor migraine headaches I was prescribed initially fiorinal around age and then changed to fioricet by my neurologist due to upper gi problems gerd Until I had this medication prescribed my life was controlled by my headaches I can remember as a teenager feeling that I couldnt be away from home for very long due to fearing a headache would come on No child or adult should have to feel that way I wish that all the physicians who are uncomfortable prescribing this medicine would read these comments Thank you
3732,Fioricet,Headache,10,42015,65,MAGIC I never leave home without at least two pills in my purse Ive suffered from migraines since I was now not that long but long enough and have been on almost everything Ive been basically turned away by two neurologists because they have nothing left to try with me I refuse to take any kind of heavy narcotic unless I am forced to go to the ER and I was finally prescribed Fioricet and it worked like no other Instead of having to drop everything I was doing when the migraine started to lay in a dark room I was able to take pills depending on the severity and go on with my day like nothing had happened Its absolutely amazing HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
3733,Fioricet,Headache,10,42012,31,It is the best medicine that really works control my tension headache One tablet is enough to make the discomfort go away in a matter of minutes It is taken only when necessary However not all doctors recommend this med because it could be habit forming and might damage the liver At times there are doctors that over reacts even though you tell them that you only take it as needed and that you were careful On the other hand there are the smart doctors that prescribes it PRN as treatment for headache
3734,Fioricet,Headache,9,41968,37,This works well if I take it when the Migraine is just starting It will stop the migraine but I may still get a head ache but it wont be debilitating
3735,Fioricet,Headache,10,41927,47,I just took this medicine for the first time I have had severe migraines for years I cant believe how well this medicine is working already I have chronic sinusitis degenerative disc decease and TMJ I also have braces and just got them tightened so I havent even wanted to get out of bed lately I am so excited I found this medicine I cant believe I was never told about it before
3736,Fioricet,Headache,1,41924,27,Didnt even touch my migraine Ive tried just about everything for chronic severe migraines including daily propranolol Imitrex Maxalt narcotics etc Only Midrin has helped Ran out and tried this Didnt help Didnt notice any side effects
3737,Fioricet,Headache,10,41912,87,Fioricet is the only medication that will quickly and effectively get rid of my migrainetension headaches Ive tried multiple other medications treatments without relief Without them Im totally incapacitated in bed no lights nausea and frequent emergency room visits So far without signs of dependence withdrawals or addiction However I despise the looks or comments at certain pharmacies like youre an addict Obviously these people have never experienced severe headaches
3739,Fioricet,Headache,7,41874,46,This medicine helps I would say it knocks the pain down of a migraine from a to a very quickly Not sure what I would do without it
3740,Ogen,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,40312,13,Ive been using Ogen for the past years and really cannot live a normal life without it I had a total hysterectomy at years of age was on Premarin for about years knowing the ingredients then on Estratest for about years before going cold turkey without anything for years Those years were hard I just wanted to go to the top of a building and jump off I tried other natural things but they didnt work I finally went to a Doctor in Canada to get an prescription for Ogen Now I discover that it is no longer being manufactured Someone needs to start remanufacturing it PLEASE
3741,Ogen,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,40213,15,I have used Ogen for over years following a hysterectomy at years of age It is absolutely wonderful I have experienced no side effects I take the name brand because generics dont work for me Following Hurricane Katrina when my doctors office was destroyed and I didnt know where to contact her I went without my Ogen for three months I then learned just how beneficial it was to my quality of life healthwiseI am distressed to learn from my pharmacist that Ogen is no longer being manufactured At least it isnt available in the Jackson Mississippi area Im going to try the generic brand as a last resort
3742,Fioricet,Headache,9,43019,1,Effective for migraine and tension headaches can cause slurring of speech and over anxiety especially on maximum dose
3743,Fioricet,Headache,1,43018,1,Was given foricet at ER for Tension headache and I suffer from severe anxiety I immediately had tachycardia fast heart beat after taking this drug it got rid of my headache but it left me miserable with my anxiety never taking this again
3744,Fioricet,Headache,9,43013,2,I started getting severe headaches months after starting a new job I loved I was only getting between hrs of sleep a night after being on my feet hrs a day Artificial lights were like swords in my brain during the day and towards the evening were intolerable Noise was also making my head hurt worse to the point where I was throwing up from the pain I was given Topamax and had great results for a week Then tapered to better results than not taking it I was still getting the headaches daily My doctor prescribed Fioricet PRN along with Propanalol to take with the Topamax as a preventative measure What a relief What a difference I had a Doctor of Osteopathy who immediately knew what to prescribe via my symptoms
3745,Fioricet,Headache,10,42987,9,I have had a pounding throbbing migraine for days a terrible throbbing pain on the left side of my head I tried everything under the sun imitrex over the counter everything the only thing that worked for me is fioricet it took away my migraine in an instant I suffer from anxiety so that caused my tension migraines this medicine puts anxiety at easy and your migraine completely gone Please dont be in pain anymore go to your doctor and get fioricet I feel for all the migraine sufferers I have been dealing with it for half my life dont be in pain anymore this medicine will really work also if you have moderate to severe anxiety like I do hope this helps
3746,Fioricet,Headache,8,42950,8,It helps to knock out the pain and reduce the tension in the head and eyes associated with migraine but it appears to be somewhat of a controlled substance or at least one that theyre wary of so Im not sure what else I can do to be migraine free Ive tried Botox twice I now know that does not work for me I tried Effexor as a prophylactic Not working This is hormone related so theres not a heck of a lot I can do here but just keep asking for more pills Not ideal but worn out My eyeball hurts right now just looking at this screen
3748,Fioricet,Headache,10,42896,13,This is the best medicine for tension headaches bar none Big pharma has tried to get it banned for years because it is so cheap and effective which is a treat to their vastly over priced dangerous and ineffective alternatives IF YOU HAVE HEADACHE OF ANY KIND I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO TRY THIS MIRACLE FOR ME MEDICATION
3751,Fioricet,Headache,9,42866,4,I take this almost every days due to my unbearable tension headaches This past time I am Rxd tabs every hrs I took my entire daily taking which is what max and I took them all but staggered and I ended up in the ER with a shot of Naloxone from overdosing on the butalbital Not sure naloxone works on barbsbut they gave it to me anyway I was so out of it I couldnt see or talk right Im someone who takes benzosor used to that is so I can handle that type of feeling BUTat the end of the day this medication DOES work for tension headaches and helps me sleep the caffeine in my opinion is cancelled out by the butalbital I take the non scheduled no codeine version although I wish I was id cut back on em
3753,Fioricet,Headache,1,42850,13,I was prescribed fioricet for migraines Not only didnt it help the migraine fioricet caused my heart rate to skyrocket due to the amount of caffeine it contains and gave me an absolutely WICKED rebound headache the next day In fact the rebound headache was worse than the original migraine Needless to say I threw the rest of the pills down the toiletFioricet is also EXTREMELY addicting if taken more than times per month Astonishingly I was prescribed to tablets EVERY hours for migraines with NO WARNING whatsoever from my doctor about how addicting this medication is Thank God it didnt work for me or else Id be a fioricet addict facing withdrawal whenever the drug isnt taken It should be taken off the market
3755,Fioricet,Headache,6,42815,4,Yesgreat medicine for migraines However the barbiturate in this drug can be bad Before I knew I was bipolar I took this medicine It made me go mentally insane for about a week out of the month Something in my brain did not like it
3757,Fioricet,Headache,6,42735,10,I have a constant headache with migraines as well I use this when my headache gets really bad and this brings it back to tolerable level and helps me sleep I only use this as needed Average less than a week

3762,Fioricet,Headache,8,42591,22,I was first prescribed fioricet for hormonal headaches during my pregnancy It was so effective and helped ease the pain It did make me drowsy I still use it for chronic headaches asneeded The only thing I wish for is that it would work a little more quickly It takes minhr for my headaches to ease off Great help allaround though

3772,Fioricet,Headache,10,41507,44,Have been using Fioricet when required for years I always go too long before taking it for tension headaches Usually one pill does wonders and I can get on with my day Will continue to use it as needed

3783,Fioricet,Headache,10,41274,66,Ive been taking Fioricet for years Ive had migraines for years I was when it was first prescribed for me before that my life revolved around my headaches Fioricet changed my life for the incredibly better Im third generation migraine sufferer so I suppose theres an argument for a genetic predisposition Up until I was headaches were an almost daily occurrence since I was very young lasting from hours to days So many things triggered them that I wont even begin to make a list I am careful about the acetaminophen component which seems to be the main potential negative health issue Rebound headaches can also occur but its nothing compared to the life enhancing benefits at least for me
3785,Fioricet,Headache,10,41159,41,Im new to the throbbing headache life Went to emergency yesterday after having had a headache that would not go away after it started days from then Chiropractor exam and such checked out Eye doctor checked out Was alternating between two pain medicines during that week in order to manage the pain ER doctor prescribed me Fioricet Im keeping a log of it as I gostarted with one pill so far to see how it went Took first pill at am and hour later the pain was numb enough to make me comfortable This morning I took it again at am since the pain was starting again minutes later the pain is gone Im really liking this medicine so far

3788,Fioricet,Headache,8,41010,26,My son has suffered with severe migraines since the age of when he was diagnosed with seizures For the better part of the next yrs I had to watch him suffer because we were told there was nothing to be done other than diet etc No one wants to see their child suffer At last we found a wonderful doctor who first prescribed Midrin which really helped but then of course insurance didnt want to pay for it anymore and suggested Fioricet pills at the most and I have my happy son back
3789,Fioricet,Headache,10,40984,29,I have been suffering from headaches and shoulder strain for years I finally found a medicine that works For me it is like taking Vicodin without the grogginess It takes the pain away and helps me relax Finally a medicine that WORKS
3790,Fioricet,Headache,10,40977,14,Im a migraine sufferer and allergic to the triptans what is generally prescribed for migraine relief ie Imitrex and its family so my doctor prescribed Fioricet and it works great for me I no longer have to rely on Excedrine and taking six of them to find relief Two Fioricet and Im typically good to go The Tylenol content doesnt bother me because I was taking a lot more with the Excedrine Im also on mg of Topamax twice daily for control which is all Ive ever found to work and Ive been quite the guinea pig there
3792,Fioricet,Headache,10,40931,22,It is the best medicine for headaches caused by TMJ and degenerative disc diease I usually never have to take the secound dose I did at first but now I dont Dont take it everyday only as needed Works good for leg aches also
3793,Fioricet,Headache,9,40882,16,I am yrs old I started getting headaches when I was about yrs old This is the only medicine Ive found that will help my headaches
3794,Fioricet,Headache,10,40792,27,Fioricet is truly a wonder drug Im had migraines since I was now and if you take it right when the headache starts lay down for minutes youll feel rejuvenated BUT Fioricet can cause rebound headaches headaches that one gets when they are used to taking a medicine for a while so while it may be hard to just take one pill when your head is throbbing and you have things to do it will pay off in the long run So try to alternate with other medicines in there so your body doesnt get used it Because I rebounded from Fioricet which means I have chronic daily migraines no fun In conclusion great medicine
3795,Fioricet,Headache,10,40779,6,Helped tremendously with headaches but I am wary of how much Tylenol is in it My doctor said no more then a day I take one because I worry about liver damage It really takes my headache away but when it returns I wont take another one

3834,Fioricet,Headache,8,39627,55,I used Fioricet for years to not only treat my headaches but to help with tense aches and pains in my shoulders It was the only thing that worked and allowed me to continue with my daily routine I did notice that after taking it for such a long time I experienced some of the withdrawls I would reccomend taking it but follow how your doctor says to take your dosages even if you think you are starting to have a quotheadachequot it might just be a rebound reaction
3835,Fioricet,Headache,9,39616,45,I have been taking Fioricet as needed for about years I love it If Fioricet doesnt help nothing does I do not find it to be habit forming at all I do find that if i take it for too many days in a row it is not as effective and then I suffer from rebound headaches

3863,Bismuth subsalicylate,Indigestion,10,42624,0,Ive found pepto Bismol really useful for when I get acid reflux It really helps to calm and cool my stomach Anytime Im feeling nauseous its the first thing I go toI also take pepto bismol when Ive eaten too much as I do have a binge eating disorder It helps prevent the reflux before it startsI only take it when Im experiencing symptoms
3864,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea,9,42413,8,As a college student with moderate IBS symptomsoverly sensitive stomach sharing one bathroom with four people can REALLY be scary Instead of having to climb out the window and run into the woods or bang on the door begging for mercy popping a couple Pepto Tablets can REALLY help relieve the symptoms of impending doom Mellows my stomach out within minutes of taking doesnt taste bad and gives me a sense of safety Sometimes your stomach still gets upset much later which at that point is completely fineit has to come out sometime right Generally speaking its usually great and I never get the upset stomach I recommend to anyone its saved me many times and can do the same for you
3865,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea,9,42371,6,Excellent stomach flu remedy Stops symptoms quickly For bad digestive issues such as the stomach flu the max liquid works better than caplets or chewable tablets Gives fast effective relief
3867,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea Chronic,2,42060,5,Terrible yes it will stop your diharea but it will just hold everything in amp make you nauses amp after the pill wears over Diharea again
3874,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,9,41247,35,Wonderful prep Had slight abdomen pain towards the end It did exactly what it was meant for It really was not bad at all The only reason it didnt get a ten was because it was a lot to drink I chugged some Sipped it And it took hours to finish but I like this because you do it at your own pace And once you are empty No more loose stools
3875,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,40904,18,I had stomach cramps within minutes of starting my first glass of Golytely and started my first bowel movement before I could even finish my first glass Aside from the nasty taste and the stomach cramps I have to say this really works I think my colon will be completely clear for the colonoscopy tomorrow morning at the rate Im going and thats saying a lot since Im disabled and have zero control down there in that area
3876,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,10,40770,40,I had been constipated for roughly days after quitting drinking this I foolishly upped my fiber intake by way more than I should have and got myself backed upI went to the doctor and he prescribed me GoLytely which is a terribly ironic name for such a medicine I already have passed stools and feel a lot better The taste is awful though Its like lemonade made with one lemon no sugar and salty well water
3878,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,10,40172,14,Worked very well
3881,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,6,42902,15,I wouldnt normally review this type of thing but I had read every horror story on the internet before I took it It didnt taste quotgoodquot and everyone is different but it was nowhere near as awful as I expected This is not medical advice but as other people have suggested chill it so its cold when you drink it use a straw As per my doctor I rinsed my mouth between glasses with ginger ale Based on what Id read I ate a low residue diet for the days before toast bananas jello yogurt applesauce and was done with the process in hours Do some stretches to move your stomach aroundMy problem turned out to be revealed thru the endoscopy not colonoscopy But this wasnt among my top worst experiences in life
3882,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,42899,7,Had to do my prep before the doctor had to go mining I chose the unflavored Used water at room temperature I would recommend this Taste a little like salty water Dont refrigerate it or you will get the chills It will clean you out I felt great I believe from the Go Lytly alone Felt great getting the pipes cleaned
3883,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,7,42860,8,I have to drink two bottles of this stuff day cleanse and this is my second night I started drinking it with a lemonade powder I LOVE lemon anything lol anyway to me it tasted horrible with the lemon so I tried it by itself and it taste like baking soda and water Last night at the beginning I felt a little bloated and a very little nausea after things started moving my stomach settled down I am drinking two jugs because my first test I used something else and did not work as well as it should have I pray this will be the last time for a long long while It does do the job
3885,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,2,42787,5,This cleanse was actual living hell The taste is horrible I do suggest mixing it with powerade or gatorade and it masks the flavor slightly You feel so bloated and shaky and it took forever to go to the bathroom Up all night with the shakes and going to the bathroom Also makes you gag and dont be fooled because the first taste isnt that bad Avoid this drug at all costs
3886,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,42709,4,wow this stuff will clean engines inside and out ha ha nasty taste but very effective wont do it again i can assure you that
3888,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1,42677,8,Its effective but it is horrible Terrible taste and too much to drink Highly recommend Suprep instead taste is not bad and only ounces at night and ounces the next morning
3889,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1,42641,9,Man this is disgusting the flavour is from the depths of hell
3890,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,8,42604,16,If you have problems for the taste I would recommend getting some Gatorade and mixing with it instead of the flavor pacet and water Tastes times better and the electrolytes help
3891,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,3,42595,17,This stuff is SO gross Ive managed to drink down the Gallon so far and NO bowel movement It tastes so hideous I feel like i might puke Not sure how I can keep drinking this
3893,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,42560,12,I know many people have trouble with the whole colonoscopy experience but I really dont know why To me it its a very comical experience Drink a glass every or so minutes and soon youll be timing for the bathroom about as frequently I liked the added note on the GoLYTELY to jiggle your tummy to help remove extra poo I have to admit after the whole GoLYTELY experience I wanted to watch what the whole fuss was about Watching the scope do its thing was amazing Now that I have to do it all again I will not drink quite as fast I wasted some by projectile vomiting some of it back up also comical but I will dance and jiggle my bowels about to get them as clean as I canMy biggest concern is what flavor to get Pineapple NOT
3894,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,8,42550,10,I was told I could add the little packets of crystal light lemonade to the Golytely to make it more tolerable I would put a packet with the glass you are drinking to measure the strength of the lemon flavor
3897,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,9,42458,76,After reading all the horror stories I wanted to cancel procedure so thought Id share my experience Honestly NOT THAT BAD Took as directed added nothing for flavor Tasted very salty just a swig of Apple juice after each oz dose every mins Had no side effects No bloating No gas pains No discomfort Had only broth on prep day Had only a chicken omelet afternoon prior to prep No cramping with bowel movements Procedure was a breeze without the quotwindquot Hope this helps ease someones anxiety
3899,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,3,42267,23,Horrible Just finished the first half and I am dreading literally dreading the second half I threw up half of it and feel sicker then a dog with a splitting migrane
3901,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,7,42150,37,This was much easier than expected First I went on low fiber diet two days before taking it One day from mednight before procedure I went on clear liquid diet with no solid food Then took GL at about PM No reaction until seventh ounce glass of GL Then it did the job its designed to do No pains or cramps The solution was cold and I got each glass down as fast as comfortably possible Taste I didnt notice anything bad about it and did not add any flavoring Its like drinking a lot of water Maybe they should have a beer flavor to make it go down even easier
3906,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Clostridial Infection,9,40031,19,I have had quite remarkable relief of severe bloating and sluggish bowel motility This had continued for three full months without relief I was even begging for surgery to find out what was wrong My abdomen was so distended that my lung capacity per spirometer was to of normal I got winded just climbing stairs at home and I could not sing Im a choir director I could not sit upright in a chair or car and I felt about months pregnant I had been on antibiotics for several weeks before this problem started Within days of starting prescription strength lactobacillus I was back to wearing most of my regular clothes was able to do a full day of errands without stopping and could sing again and dropped pounds
3907,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,43063,0,I have type diabetes and because of high blood sugar levels I used to suffer from yeast infections at least twice a year A friend told me about acidophilus pills and I am forever grateful I take them by mouth a couple of times a month to prevent yeast infections and if I ever feel one coming on or just generally feel any kind of irritation I will break a pill in half and wet it a bit so its more comfortable and insert into the affected area You definitely need to get comfortable with yourself to do that but its so worth it It wont completely break down and might come back out after a couple days but it works Taking too many by mouth gave me a little bloating and gas but Ill take that over the painful infections I hope this helps
3915,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,42486,72,I suffered a year battle with BV I tried several prescription medications numerous antibiotics oral amp vaginal suppositories Whatever doctors said I did with no success After lots of research I came upon acidophilus and its amazing curing benefitsThe chronic BV went away and stayed away I just purchased over the counter store brand acidophilus tablets Nothing fancy or prescribed I inserted acidophilus tablet pills vaginally for days then tablet for more days and had immediate relief and results After the st week was completed vaginally I then started taking one pill daily orally to maintain a healthy PH I would highly recommend this to any woman suffering with BV
3916,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,9,42459,12,Worked quite well no side effects took half a caplet X daily to equal the recommended dose of caplet per day to try and avoid any stomach discomfort
3917,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Constipation,8,42286,7,Acidophilus is now the only supplement medication I take to manage constipation which is a sideeffect of opiod medications which Ive been taking for a number of years Prior to my adding acidophilus capsule form to my regime constipation was a chronic problem causing me constant concern and trying various remedies none of which worked until I came upon acidophilus This has truly worked wonders
3918,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1,42222,2,Miserable bloated abdominal cramps
3919,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42211,4,YES LAcidophilus is excellent for IBS particularly for the weird somewhat abstract and oblique stomach uncomfortableness However I find that taking two capsules to times a day preferably on an empty stomach is the best way I use LAcidophilus as an adjunct to my onceaday regular more comprehensive probiotic Always store refrigerated
3920,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Diarrhea,1,42161,8,Terrible quick negative response with loud stomach growling and rd Day Evening blast of Diarrhea keeping me in bathroom with gas bloating Very uncomfortable physically No choice but to stop Disappointed hoping so much for help regulating system and regular daily normal functions
3921,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42110,7,I first saw this on TV adds for yogurt I bought the pills and after just a few days I feel great I used to get pain in my lower back not any more I havent even told my doctor yet This stuff is great
3922,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42104,43,I have suffered with constipation for years after having a major surgery The pain would be in my lower back and made it difficult for me to stand particularly in the early morning I have been taking over the counter acidophilus pills times a day with meals and I dont experience the excruciating pain anymore I carry my pills in purse I highly recommend these tablets
3924,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,41749,46,I have used this for years Women tend to have a hard time with yeast infection during the time of taking antibiotics Well taking this times a day will keep it at bay Also taking it once a day on regular basis helps to keep the yeast in the vagina from growing I have used this for oral thrush also Eating yogurts will take care of that
3926,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,8,41303,55,Having yeast flares monthly for months Nothing clearing it completely however Acidophilus placed vaginally really relieves symptoms Taking a probiotic orally really helps as well Hoping to stay on top of it this time
3927,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,41104,21,The last year I have suffered greatly from colitis I began researching other treatments and medicines because whatever the doctor gave me did little to combat I was miserable diarrhea nausea cramping especially in the mornings and EVERY time I ate Could not go anywhere without an episode After one week I noticed a difference After weeks nausea and cramping very minimal After weeks I am off ALL other medicines I SWEAR by this
3928,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Clostridial Infection,9,40807,3,Works great
3931,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,40662,96,I have been on metrinidazole metrogel and varies creams for Bacterial vaginosis and nothing controlled my BV like acidophillis The best brand that I have found is Pectin each capsule has billion good bacterias in them BV is no fun this has really helped me
3932,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,43057,2,I was taking mg of Seroquel XR for months The best part was being able to get a good nightrsquos sleep I had only been getting hrs rest each night My mind would race and it was a struggle to stay in bed I would get up and start cleaning Additionally I would spend hours creating plans to organize my life I had not actually followed any of those plans and I was depressed I took Latuda for a short period but it made my inability to sleep worse Thatrsquos when I was switched to Seroquel I loved the way it helped me feel normal The bad I gained lbs in months I asked to be taken off and started taking Geodon Once again I cannot sleep I am going to ask to go back to Seroquel XR and focus on following a healthy diet
3933,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,43045,3,Ive been on this for years and it is my rock It literally helps me so much I couldnt have made it through high school without it Honestly its what helped me through my suicidal phases I still get them but its not as intense and I dont try and act on it anymore
3934,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,3,43005,3,I had the worst sideeffect from this medication I was originally prescribed it about a year ago for insomnia related to my Bipolar It worked to get me to sleep but eventually I started to have enormous amounts to rectal pain so I went off of it when I stopped cycling I was put on it again this year when my cycling started again and I again had the same pain It was absolutely awful So I am off of it now and never want to be put on it again
3935,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42964,9,I have been taking this drug for a year and a half and it has changed my life Ive tried various drugs and lifestyle treatments over years of great instability and desperation going between breakdown after breakdown Finding the right dose and preparation slow release has not only lifted me from crisis but improved my wellbeing to an all time level It took a little while to adjust In particular it guarantees me a good night sleep and I can up the dose slightly if things slip It has done wonders for my anxiety and given me the stability to really be what I want to beI feel it is important to note that the drug is one part of the picture and mindfulness exercise socialprofessional support etc are important where possible
3936,Seroquel XR,Schizoaffective Disorde,1,42963,1,I have been taking Seroquel XR mg for almost years Before this I was taking low dose regular Seroquel for many years It really helps me manage my schizoaffective disorder I am also taking a doctors prescribed antihistamine hydroxyzine mg because I get hives while on seroquel XR I have noticed male breast growth and hard glandular breast tissue build up under my breast during this year I am also experincing breast pain I am on a calorie restricted diet and have been exercising and lifting weights regularly for the past years and have gained lbs to lbs in weight I have low body fat and can do push ups in a row easily so its not body fat
3938,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42923,6,Great med weight gain yes lbs over months started working out at the gym and watching what I eat and feeling good and hopeful for the future down lbs does feel little of loss motivation at mg trying to lower dose to mg update later
3939,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42909,6,Recently able to get the XR in generic form This has been a complete life changing medication for me It has improved all areas of my condition to a point I am fully capable to manage life without any other assistance
3943,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42882,16,This drug is a wonder drug After years of brutal bipolar symptoms undiagnosed untreated which destroyed my whole life I now take mg at night and now I can have a normal life free of anxiety mood swings bipolar symptoms etc I hold down a responsible fulltime job healthy relationships and friendships I have hobbies I never had any of that before my bipolar destroyed my whole life Seroquel gave it backI hear of people wanting to go off Seroquel Im the opposite I would go to any lengths to make sure I never have to go off it Ill gladly spend the rest of my life on it because it gives me a normal life and I wont risk that for anything Ive been on it years no side effects
3945,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,42875,10,I was on this medication for around years at different doses anywhere from mgs to mgs It was a very good medicine and helped a lot with my anxiety and depression and really calmed me down and was very helpful but the weight gain was a killer I would try to go off over and over and would have to keep going back to it because I would be in such bad shape without it I had a lovehate relationship with it I became prediabetic while on it I finally was able to go off and stay off at one point Its a great drug but the side effects are horrible as far as weight gain
3946,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42868,13,SeroquelXR has changed my life for the better I am currently on mg once daily I also take klonopin before I go to work For the last months I have not had to call out sick from work which was a monthly occurrence before Seroquel I have not had to take a leave of absence in the last year I used to have to take six week leaves a year I feel much more positive about my job and my life in general It has been a game changer for me The only down side is the weight gain It seems to slow your metabolism down and increase your appetite after taking it making it difficult to loose weight I am currently not overweight so the weight gain is a small price to pay I do have to exercise regularly and watch more carefully what I eat
3947,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42854,12,I dont understand all the negative reviews For me this pill has worked well Its calmed me right down and has been blissful at moments Its expensive unfortunately As for weight gain Ive noticed that its pretty neutral Granted Im weaning off of Zoloft as well so who knows but I find with medications with weight gain as a side effect just trying your hardest to eat a well balanced diet will prevent it Its too easy to give up and say oh well Im gonna get fat its very much not the case Dont give up if youre bipolar like me theres a chance you can do a lot with your brain so give it a shot and take your life back I think much more clearly and am more productive The overwhelming tiredness subsided after one week
3948,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,42845,7,I have Bipolar most the time being on Seroquel has helped settle my racing thoughts helps me sleep at night and helps me regulate my moods At times I still get the highs and lows but not as severe without Seroquel The side effects that I get is dry mouth dry skin increased appetite and High Cholestrol Most of the time this medication helps me out
3949,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42836,8,I take this medication for bipolar but it also does wonders for generalized anxiety disorder I have suffered for DECADES with anxiety and panic attacks and SSRIs have stopped working for me When I started taking seroquel it was like I finally saw color in the black and white world I was living in My moods are completely under control and my anxiety is controlled for the most part This medication definitely has side effects Its a tranquilizer It makes you very tired It also made me gain a significant amount of weightbut I would rather deal with the side effects then deal with the horrible anxiety I was living with everyday I take it before bedmake sure youre able to get at least hours of sleep so youre not groggy the next day
3951,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42809,12,Im yrs old have severe RA and been talking seroquel XR at milligrams a night for nearly a year I was diagnosed bipolar years ago but had so much trouble finding a psychiatrist who was caring enough to listen to me like a psychologist AND work as a psychiatrist pill pusher so my diagnosis went treated and untreated on and off for a while BUT since Ive been seeing my doctor regularly and she seems to genuinely care Ive trusted her judgment with her diagnosis and what she thought would help me most besides the weight gain honestly I feel much more stable amp I can deal with the world around me as I see it and havent had any serious depressive episodes or hypomania This medication has worked wonders for me
3953,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,42760,26,I have depression with anxious disitressMy extremely racing thoughts would typically whip me up into a panicky state sometimes with outbursts of irrational anger Seroquel XR works fantastically to ease that racing mind to a more normaland useful pace Side effects are virtually absent the XR doesnt floor me like immediate release Seroquel did I can function and think well Seroquel XR is a good medicine It also helps with my depression

3957,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,42648,42,I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder with psychotic features I was put in intensive out patient care after going to the Emergency Room for intense auditory hallucinations that were so malicious I feared for my own life Lost my job and everything Seroquel has given me hope as well as lorazepam for my anxiety To me seroquel is a miracle drug for its antipsychotic features as well as depression Im having to up the dosage lately because my voices are creeping back in Searching for further pychiactric help but right now Im stable and I thought that would be impossible Sharing a good experience Thanks for reading
3960,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42605,21,This med is pretty wonderful for my bipolar mania and my bipolar depression Only set back is the sedation but at the same time Ive always struggled with anciety so this side effect is okay with me as it helps the anxiety Really saved my life
3961,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,42597,38,I have only been on Seroquel XR for about a week at mg My doctor prescribed it as an adjunct to Remeron to treat anxiety depression paranoia and insomnia I also take gabapentin atenolol and Xanax When the Seroquel XR works it WORKS I can feel it sedating me two hours after I take it Ive been sleeping eight and nine hours a night which has not happened in a very very long time Its effective at neutralizing both anxiety and depression BUT it doesnt last hours for me it only lasts about Once it wears off my anxiety and depression return with a vengeance Makes for a very rough or hours until I can take it again
3962,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42567,20,First of all let me start by saying that I hear that this is an expensive drug because of how new it is Luckily for me perhaps lol my insurance considera me catastrophic due to my checkered past and pays the entire price because they want me to take this medication and stfu lol Since taking Seroquel XR my life has improved so much and I really have never felt more stable in my life Ive tried anticonvulsants and other antipsychotics and they have not worked for me This medication really does to my surprise The only downfall is that Ive gained pounds taking it but any antipsychotic will do that Strongly recommend Seroquel XR
3963,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,4,42527,15,I really noticed a negative difference when comparing the XR version to the regular Seroquel It took longer to kick in and made me so drowsy at work that I felt like I was drunk I think I was taking mg When I went back to regular Seroquel mg put me to sleep fast and made a difference in stabilizing my mood without me feeling too drowsy to function the next day
3966,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,7,42469,15,I was prescribed seroquel xr for Bipolar depression My dr started me on mg and I am gradually increasing the dosage its been about weeks and I am currently taking mg I will agree that it has helped the hopelesness feelings and suicidal thoughts Which is a plus but the zombie like feeling and dry mouth are tough I have a job that requires constant activity its hard to keep up have to definitely slow down My Dr advised me that these side affects are all normal and eventually I will get used to it cant wait for this to happen
3967,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,42459,23,It was mainly prescribed as a sleep aid in addition to its antidepressant qualities I was on regular Seroquel and now on XL as I have trouble staying asleep Its slightly better Im getting hours of sleep a night I am not usually groggy or snowed by this maybe once per doses Im ok with it Only downside is cost XL is brand
3968,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42452,13,Been on Quetiapine MR for around months mg at night Found it far less sedating than Olanzapine Its been a miracle for my Bipolar absolutely no depression and no manic episodes Yeah I put on weight but the effects on my mood and mental health have been incredible
3970,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42441,20,OK its only early days day to be exact on mg morning and night Its amazing After reading all the horror stories of the tranquilliser effects zombie like statescravings Its an understatement when I said I was petrified what effect this would have on me First day within an hour of taking it I slept for six hours woke up feeling fine refreshed even Then dosed up in the evening at again asleep by slept like a baby am Woke feeling energised lighter happier No drowsiness or brain fuzz I feel so much more positive about life in generalI feel so blissfully normal Day still napping within hrs of dose for hrs max but I could push through it And still sleeping all night
3971,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42390,33,This medication has been a real lifesaver I had struggled with heavy depressions interspersed with hypomania for a few years before I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder for which I was prescribed this The initial mg did nothing except be an overrated sleep pill but the boost to mg for bipolar depression helped begin to mellow me out and a few weeks later I was starting to experience a life free of devastating mood swings Ive read horror stories online but I experienced nothing of the sort actually lost weight in the past few months Its a shame theres risks with longterm use I would happily take this forever otherwise these past few months have been nice and happy and productive for me thanks to this
3972,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,2,42388,13,Im currently and a male My depression has only worsened since and before my initial diagnosis of depression and generalized social and quotacutequot anxiety years ago Ive been in a major depression for at least five years tried to kill myself twice and am unable to take care of myself Ive lived alone since I left for college in I still live alone here Ive been on any SSRI I can think of so this was a last resort med Seroquel has made me much too tired to work or do anything else The only stars I gave it relate to the reduced anxiety when Im ACTUALLY AWAKE Other than that Im more numb than I ever and are at risk of losing my job
3973,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42373,11,I was on citolopram celexa lithium mg daily and olanzapine mg and a lot of benzos A state run mental health clinic opened in a local town so I stopped seeing the private psychiatrist and started to attend the public clinic The psychiatrist was revolutionary She immediately stopped the antidepressant because it was elevating mood into mania She dropped lithium to one dose at night to aid kidney wear and tear She stopped olanzapine because I was still having mild persistent psychosis and put me on mg of quetiapine seroquel The first week was tough I was very nauseous and sleepy but once my body adjusted it was much better The mix of quetiapine and lithium is really working for me
3975,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,42362,64,Ive been on Venlafaxine mg along with Quetiapine Mirtazapine and Pregabalin for Major Depression for around yearsAugmentation therapy works for me Its not perfect but this level of Venlafaxine along with the other meds has kept me alive Im not getting better but Im certainly more stable and not going downhill and not suicidal So in conclusion dont be scared of meds they may just save your life
3976,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,10,42360,19,Absolutely amazing drug Has quite literally saved my life Pity I need to lie to the Australian government about having bipolar to get it prescribed No doubt this is stopping many thousands of Australians from getting access to it Seriously I went from suicidal for severalmonths to absolutely normal in one dose One dose Talk to your doctor about this if anti depressants are not working for you Understand it may require you to lie about having bipolar
3977,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,42319,41,My experience on Seroquel nearly cost me my job as it turned me into a ZOMBIE Since going off the drug I am fully functional My head is clear and I have energy to do thingsI cannot believe my Dr prescribed me an antipsychotic drug such as seroquel Colleagues observing me thought I had undergone a major personality disorder I have been off it for a month now and not missing it one bit
3978,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,42318,51,I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder months ago i am but I do not have that Instead I have BPD and depression I was taking olanzapine which took away my entire life I could barely do anything but for the past days with seroquel it has almost the opposite effect Together with Prozac I have felt more motivated and less suicidal Also Im able to control my anxiety and I have more control over my behaviour I also have trouble focusing but this has helped me focus on therapy a lot more Sleep not great but Im only on mg I only sleep for about hours and then wake up and keep going back to sleep This is the first drug thats given me hope
3979,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,1,42302,7,This was the absolute worst medication i have ever taken What a nightmare To begin with I was taking Duloxetine mg x a day Wellburtin Xl mg x a day Valium mg x a day morphine mg x a day oxycodone mg x a day I was doing just fine or do I thought I had a change of Doctors due to the fact that my Doctor left this practice Not sure the reason for this medication Never Again After starting that medication once it really got in my system my worst fear came to reality I totally went outside my mind to the point my daughter was so scared of my behavior she called the EMS Upon arrival at the ER after blood work was told I was overly medicated Never Never Again Awful
3980,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,42297,6,I use Seroquel XR in addition to Tegretol XR and Geodon It is sort of the adjunct to these primary medications But it does its job at keeping me stable when the base medication mix falls short
3981,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42285,16,I have been taking seroquel for a little over a year and a half now and it has been the best thing for me I started off at mg when my mania was insanely uncontrollable But after months I was able to go down to and ever since its been perfect because I dont fight the drowsiness in the mornings and get a great nights rest I did gain weight only pounds but I have always been extremely athletic sport collegiate athlete and it didnt really affect me at all Just as long as it keeps the manicdepressive episodes on lock down I think I can handle a curvier bodyI seriously reccommend this if you can handle a little weight gain
3983,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1,42822,13,I have taken Risendronate for only weeks and have severe bone pain in my hands I cannot bear the pain I also have burning sensation in my throat I was given alendronate to start with and they also made me feel so ill I wont be taking any more I really dont know what to do as I dont want the injection or infusion
3984,Risedronate,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1,42768,9,Took first pill morning of Oct amp that night went to turn over in bed amp felt the most excruciating pain in my lower back radiating through my chest that it took my breath away In tears went to my regular dr who prescribed muscle relaxers amp home from work for days I also experienced flulike symptoms a recurrence of my acid reflux tiredness increased insomnia amp just felt lousy Reluctantly took the nd dose in Nov didnt experience the back pain but still have episodes of that back spasm but very slight but did experience all the other side effects Im so done with this med and now my gyno wants me to take Prolia Reading forums and its side effects I am scared to death especially since its a sixmonth dosage

3992,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,10,42091,20,I am allergic to Fosamax My doctor gave me an Atelvia sample to try and I found I had no side effects from this medicine I credit this to its timerelease function
3993,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1,41992,28,My doctor gave me samples to use while I awaited my insurance to approve After taking the first dosage in approximately hours I was in the hospital Side effects for me were extreme bone pain indigestion Doctors thought I was having a heart attack
3994,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1,41980,59,Took this medication for months From the start I had problems tolerating the medicine It made me nauseous The worst side effect was the bone pain
3997,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,8,41585,27,Good result
3998,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,3,41520,82,I took Actonel as directed for four months Each time my body ached so badly that I could barely walk and had to take time off from work I took myself off the medication because I just couldnt function I go back to my doctor tomorrow Im sure Ill be scolded

4001,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,4,40671,103,I took Actonel for months Im yrs young and active One day each month after taking Actonel I had flulike symptoms for months and then it got better however I experienced esophagus burning
4003,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,5,39986,93,By the end of the first day I was very lethargic and had abdominal cramps and bloating followed by diarrhea Throughout the night and all through the second day I experienced flulike symptoms relieved slightly with aspirin but continued with abdominal tenderness and discomfort as well as very lethargic By the third day the muscle aches were gone but the abdominal tenderness continued Appetite did go down Hopefully there is truth to the first dose being the most difficult in regards to side effects
4004,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,4,39926,91,First day no symptoms Next day a bit achy But the next day felt bloated and nauseous The achy flulike symptoms were gone but for the next week I felt sick constipated and had no appetite

4006,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,42279,57,I have taken it for PTSD at night for a long time Im able to sleep without having horrific nightmares There is weight gain but that boosts me to eat healthy and exercise which helps my depression klonipin to help with daytime anxiety and Seroquel before bed are the two drugs that keep me sane and able to live a normal life
4008,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,42242,33,Hate this med Constantly sick on it Stomach pain severe diarrhea passing out severe dizziness and unable to wake up Hungry for food all the time Nasty taste in mouth Thirsty all the time Cant motivate myself to do anything This was on the lowest dose available Wont take it ever again dont care what my doctor says No way
4009,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,2,42235,10,Took Seroquel XR for about months experienced help with sleep issues for about a week before that wore off Gained at least lbs in this time frame due to increased appetite and general weight gain due to the drug Never really seemed to help my bipolar disorder the other medicines I take do that
4012,Seroquel XR,Depression,3,42208,20,In the beginning I was on mg of seroquel not extended release for years Got pregnant they took me off I moved provinces they ended up putting me back on a smaller dose mg sleeping wise I would go to sleep right away and stay asleep all night For the past months they decided to put me on mg seroquel xl now it takes me hours to fall asleep and I wake up constantly throughout the night and have a hard time falling back asleep I feel like xl does not work near as good depression wise and sleeping wise
4013,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42197,44,This medication completely changed my lifeMy diagnosis is mixed rapidcycling bipolar disorder with psychotic features Before my regimine I would suffer a week of depression followed by a day of dangerous mixed affective episode followed by a few hours of euphoria before the process wouls begin all over again I had ruminating and intrusive thoughts panic atacks anxiety extreme guilt dissociation and suicidal ideation and a few nearattemptsBut within weeks of the therapeutic dose my mood stabilized my anxiety dropped off my obsessive and intrusive ruminations relinquished their hold and unexpectedly I gained a spectrum of emotions I didnt even know I lacked and that was the best thing of allTruly lifealtering
4014,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,2,42176,13,I went from talking mgs of Cymbalta to taking mgs of Seroquel XR just over one year ago I fortunately did not suffer from any if the initial side effects that Ive now researched amp have learned are really common when starting this medication However month ago Im not sure why but I ended up missing nightly doses What I experienced was nothing short of being in hell literally I physically was incapable of movement getting up to simply get to the restroom was near impossible every muscle in my body was weak amp near useless I couldnt do anything but remain in a fetal position curled up on my side for the duration of over hours My head was cloudy confused amp unable to process any thought After this experience I want off
4015,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,5,42142,19,Not bad but the weight gain and how tired it made me eventually led me to go off of it
4016,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,7,42109,7,I lost touch with reality for quite a while I mainly use this as a sleep aid but I am a paranoid schizophrenic As far as symptoms of my schizophrenia it helps However whenever its about time to take my dose I notice my condition worsening a lot If I take it late I am loopy and a bit delusion but I hold a steady job that requires us to work late some days Also if I am just having an overall bad day it seems to not help my symptoms at all I am pretty sure I would be a lot worse without this medication My insurance doesnt cover it but I got a card from the doctor making my prescription only cost around bucks If I didnt have that card it would be about bucks with my work insurance or something with none
4017,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42102,23,For years I took seroquel in various doses throughout the given day I was prescribed Seroquel XR about years ago for Anxiety and Bipolar l Since then it has been very effective I did not gain weight at all The only drawback is it does cause dizziness and sleepiness Therefore I sometimes opt to take it later than prescribed pm instead of
4018,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,42100,21,At first I hated this medication made me really tired feelings of non reality and weight gain The doctor who put me on it said to wait and give it a chance Im glad I did I use it to sleep at night at some point I will reduce it but its great for now I have very restful sleeps but am unable to remember my dreams I am bipolar and although I am on other medication for it I believe that Seroquel has been key in my mood stability I take mg every night and mg PRN for anxiety if needed Although I get tired on it it does slow down my thoughts
4020,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,9,42066,5,Works great for me
4021,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,42055,91,Seroquel XR worked very well for me with a combination of Seroquel and Zoloft together Ive been well for over years now Usually I would fall in to a depression with in a year just taking an antidepressent Because my body would build a tolerance to the medications I know this medicine isnt for everyone but Ive had a very good experience and Im stable and happy
4022,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,9,42012,22,I have been taking this for five years and have never been better I think you just have to find what works for you My Psych Doc is the best
4023,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,7,42000,10,When I was I was put on mgday before bed time and within months I gained pounds It worked super well to get rid of my hallucinations including the tactile ones but it made me extremely zombielike My grades slipped at school and I slept as soon as I got home till the next morning The first day I slept hours This medicine made me so hungry all the time and no matter how much I ate I was never full
4024,Seroquel XR,Schizoaffective Disorde,6,41985,2,Unfortunately after more than a year pervasive stuff like weight gain increased lipids diabetes all started to be present Great for a while but I started toned more of it to deal with psychotic symptoms and the sedative nature of it got in the way Swapped to paliperidone ER which is more focused on the psychotic symptoms and doing well without the sedation
4025,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,41971,64,I was prescribed seroquel mg for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I could only take it for two days I took it as prescribed before bedtime I almost crashed my truck several times on my way to work and I had to pull over on the shoulder to sleep on my way home from work Day was a Saturday I slept for hours I cant function at all on this
4026,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,9,41971,22,Seroquel for depression isnt heard of much Im on it and yes at first it was horrible Head spins and just like motion sickness But I was advised to stick it out and did Approx weeks it settled down I take it for BiPolar the racing mind no sleep or little sleep With Seroquel I sleep a nights rest My mind isnt active at all Im on mg A bit tired of a morning but if you are up early which can be hard the effects wear off sooner I wont swap to any other I tried Zyprexa but Im sticking with Seroquel
4030,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,5,41905,15,Worked but made me drowsy and put on weight
4031,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,41844,55,Ive only been on Seroquel for weeks but I have had a largely positive experience I have had a diagnosis of depression for about ten years and was using Cipralex Lexapro I came off Cipralex twice and both times I became very depressed Even on Cipralex my mood was constantly changing so I went to see a psychiatrist who thinks I may have Cyclothymia or bipolar so started me on mg of Seroquel Initially I was very groggy but have gotten over that Ive also gained a stone in weight But my mood has really stabilised for the first time I feel happy confident and passionate I no longer have a million thoughts in my head so can focus better Hopefully this continues

4035,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,41677,111,I am presently in hospital and have been put on Seroquel XR As previously commented the low dosages cause lethargy and sleepiness However I am not nearly as suicidal as I was I have hope for the future and have not been on for more than a few days I am optimistic that once I have reached the proper dosage that I will once again enjoy life as I once did Paxil Effexor and a number of other antidepressants worsened by symptoms over time andor never did do much for the depressive symptoms in the first place This medicine is worth trying if you are extremely depressed or suicidal
4037,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,41611,66,Works like a charm It was prescribed for me for Bipolar I disorder as part of my cocktail of meds especially for symptoms involving lack of sleep I have been struggling with sleep problems for so many years and this works great for me at mg It even helps with depression and anxiety temporarily I feel a lot calmer which is definitely needed for me especially at night It helps with racing thoughts and voices as well No more quotnoisequot in my head at night for most part
4038,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,41598,70,I have had Bipolar DisorderPersonality Disorder and severe depression for about years and have tried just about every medicine there is A recent setback had me in hospital my Dr decided to put me on Seroquel XR mg along with my other medicines In the beginning it seemed to help me as time went on my symptoms of low mood suicidal thoughts etc came backmost important to note was the WEIGHT GAIN In under a year almost lbs for no real reason Extreme fatigue and sleepinesshard to get out of bed in the mornings Am now reducing dosage to slowly get off it as per Drs orders and switching to an alternative I am hoping this will work
4040,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,41588,29,I took regular Seroquel which did help somewhat I would rate that at a out I found about Seroquel XR when people told me to see a pdoc this was in because I was bipolar and couldnt get it under control on my first visit with pdoc I told her my situation and Seroquel after my visit she gave me samples of Seroquel XR which was only out months at that time it has been a huge help with mania and depression I take mgs at bedtime when I wake up I take mg Lamictal that helps a great deal for me with the racing thoughts and impulsivity along with mg of clonazepam that has been a life saver it took many years in and out the psyc hospitals to finally get it right
4041,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,9,41552,34,From the age of eleven to seventeen I lost touch to reality no doctor could figure out what was wrong with me cause I didnt tell my real problems I was living in an imaginary world At the age of seventeen I was finally able to express some of my problems and got started on Seroquel XR day by day I had the feeling of becoming normal again and regained the control over my own life I still have issues from all the problems that involved my past but I can truly say that I got control back I truly think Seroquel XR saved my life
4043,Seroquel XR,Schizoaffective Disorde,9,41504,21,I take this medication for its side effects primarily It works great if you have severe insomnia This medicine makes you very hungry when you take it It also helps to relive anxious feelings and help calm feelings of stress Again my doctor prescribed this medicine due to weight loss insomnia anxiety This is not what the medicine is exactly made for but I have tried dozens of medicines and this is the only one that has helped with my problems
4045,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,41431,97,I have had depression since I was a child but I didnt start getting help for it until I was I have tried Prozac and Celexa which did nothing for me and then my doctor asked me if I have ever heard of a medicine called Seroquel XR I started out on mg and then worked my way up to mg The only side effects for me were weight gain and drowsiness but the drowsiness went away after a couple of months of using this medicine Overall I really like this medicine It has helped me tremendously
4046,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,41424,116,After taking Seroquel for months at mg I recently upped it to mg at nighttime This has resulted in me being able to drop my Ativian from mg to mg and still get a great sleep I am much more productive think clearly and feel positive I feel like my personality is coming back Coincidence I think not
4047,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,7,41403,32,I take this medication for Bipolar II and it has been amazing at stabilizing my moods I no longer feel filled with rage and irritability and no longer have issues with impulsive thoughts The big problem that I am having with this medication is horrendous weight gain I exercise at least three times a week and eat well yet I have gained kg pounds in the months that I have been on this medicine Another issue I have is vivid dreams But I think this is just a sign of getting deep and sound sleep something I could never achieve prior to taking this medicineIt is amazing but a nightmare all rolled into one
4048,Seroquel XR,Depression,7,41394,47,I was put on mg of Seroquel at age due to major depression I agree with the previous comment made even on such a low dose I also feel Im in a chemical straight jacket I have trouble thinking straight I cant concentrate for over minutes my sleep is average its extremely hard to wake up I also find Im so much more angrier and impulsive I stutter and cant form words as well as shaking uncontrollably in my legs when I get anxious I also get headaches or even at least twice per week However my family and close friends have noticed a considerable improvement in my mental health eg suicidal thoughts have almost stopped completely and an increase in more happy Emma daysSuch a strong powerful and dangerous med
4049,Seroquel XR,Depression,7,41387,58,I have been on a few antidepressants for years with only fair results My Doctor started me on some Seroquel XR mg at bedtime over the last few weeks This medication not only has helped me with the terrible side effects when you come off many of the typical SSRI but I am sleeping and my depression has improved from a out of to out of ten Sometimes SSRI medication side effects are stated as minor but they can be very severe at times More Doctors should know about Seroquel XR and the great results when stopping antidepressants
4050,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,41341,42,I was diagnosed with bipolar II about yrs ago and Ive tried everything on the market nothing worked for me except Seroquel Right now I take mg twice per day and Im so stable Im loving it problem though with Seroquel is that its a major weight gainer I would stop taking it on and off when I felt better but then would use other meds to bandage my symptomsget back on then off againuntil one day I decided to stop with the denial and allow someone to help me for real Ive been on it now faithfully for monthsbut Ive put on lbs It makes me eat after hours in the middle of the night Im depressed because of the weight gain So I workout at home at times trying to be more consistent You have to work this medicine
4051,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,2,41293,20,I was one of the unlucky ones whos prolactin levels skyrocketed I was only on mg with a plan to ramp my way up to over the course of weeks which was obviously vetoed when my chest started swelling quite noticeably Lactation isnt worth whats essentially only a sleeping pill at ltmg doses

4056,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,1,41201,22,I have had a negative experience on Seroquel I do not want this to deter anyone from taking it as everyones reaction and experience on this medicine is subjective I just want to put this out there for anyone who might be experiencing similar symptoms and reactions and may be hesitant to say it and to just relate my own experienceI am Bipolar and have untreated ADHD due to the ADHD medicines causing manic episodes I started Seroquel months ago when I was having a bout of insomnia I should state that I was on Wellbutrin Lamictal and Paxil and was feeling good I was productive during the day and upbeat I was prescribed Seroquel for the insomnia and taken off all the other except Lamictal I am now a quotzombiequot depressed sleepy

4059,Seroquel XR,Paranoid Disorde,9,41099,25,Seroquel XR worked for me better than the Seroquel From my understanding the XR is an extended release vs the regular Seroquel My paranoid thoughts have completely gone away except for the normal paranoia that everyone has of people sometimes talking about them It also gives me a lot of energy during the day and I do not have to take naps I have tried Abilify and other medicines but none seem to work as well as the Seroquel XR
4060,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,6,41086,36,My Dr gave me a sample of this medicine to try and it works good however it takes me a while to fall asleep and it gave me a hangover effect the next day Liked the sleep it gave me but I had a hard time waking up the next day
4061,Seroquel XR,Post Traumatic Stress Disorde,10,41057,45,Within three days basically all my anxiety is gone and I feel fantastic FINALLY a doctor and psychologist worked together to treat what they said quotuniquequot problem I had anxiety all the time but wasnt depressed So Im one happy lady and Im sure my kids are loving there old mum back
4062,Seroquel XR,Post Traumatic Stress Disorde,8,41055,38,A little tired some mornings which can occasionally last during the day As a medicine it is amazing makes me strong mentally and relaxed
4063,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,41010,41,Was taken off Geodon because of nighttime anxiety and put on Seroquel XR I feel so unmotivated Sedated I no more feel better by afternoon when its time to take it again I dread the next dose Havent felt this depressed in a while
4065,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,6,40977,26,Seroquel was the only thing that knocked me out Ive been on it for months but have gained lbs which I have attributed to Seroquel Not to mention that diet and exercise arent cutting it to lose the weight Wish I could find something that could make me sleep as well as Seroquel without the weight gain
4066,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,10,40955,29,Put me to sleep for over yrs the best sleep I ever got I just cant take it anymore because it raises my blood sugar
4067,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,40941,123,Ive had depression since I was a young teenager I didnt decide to get treatment until I was I felt like I was unraveling I didnt want to get out of bed I lost interest in all the things that I once loved to do I had problems with drugs and alcohol Sleeping problems The whole nine yardsThe medication that my doctor decided to put me on was Seroquel XR I was a little apprehensive at first being a drug user for many years I knew what Seroquel was My doctor assured me that in a controlled and carefully watched environment she believed it would help She started me on mgs Ive moved to mgs Ive had drastic positive changes in my mood I feel happy rested and content No negative side effects It worked miracles
4068,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,40926,64,Ive had depression for years and have been on Paxil about The Paxil worked for a few years but the anxiety and depression slowly worked its way back into my life So along with the Paxil they added other drugs Effexor Wellbutrin but they made me even more anxious I was finally put on regular Seroquel and found it worked for a little while but I was so tired all the time I couldnt function the next day I was literally fired from jobs from being stuck in bed and refusing to get up I was switched to Seroquel XR mg last year combined with the mgs of Paxil Im still on and Ive found a drastic improvement in my mood anger and anxiety My only complaint would be how sleepy it makes me in the mornings A large coffee or a caffeinated beverage does the trick though and its worth the sleepiness to have some peace of mind
4069,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,1,40926,62,SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN and METABOLIC SYNDROME I had always suffered from anxiety from childhood to adulthood My doctor prescribed a low dosage of MG in December At the time I was prescribed Seroquel XR MG I weighed lbs petite frame size or On January I weighed in at lbs The lbs of weight gain within one year went to my abdomen and I am covered in cellulite on my abs hips back buttocks and thighs I monitored my diet and intake the entire time but the weight gain was out of control
4070,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,9,40916,29,I loved how the XR worked for me I was on mg at night Was a day trial to see if it would help me it did My GP gave me the XR then my psychiatrist switched me to the IR mg so I could take either or pills depending how I felt That seemed to be working okay but I had another anxiety attack and it has been days since and I am still not recovered Tonight I am going to take the XR and see what tomorrow brings Luckily I do go to my Dr as well I am sure that I will feel better tomorrow as I felt great the day after my first XR dose
4071,Seroquel XR,Depression,5,40854,37,The first night I took this medication I almost ran out of breath before climbing the stairs from the basement to my room its as if my respiratory system was somewhat repressed It also caused some chestheart pain On the other hand I slept well for those two nights The side effects may be more dangerous than ones condition Please be careful
4073,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,40804,28,Seroquel XR is very good It boost up my energy After trying other medications this is the best with little side effects In the morning you feel like staying in bed and weight gain because of hunger craving
4074,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,3,40796,20,Made me too quothungoverquot and groggy the next day I was even breaking my mg pill in half
4075,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40780,26,I used to be so paranoid I couldnt even sleep at night I would go into manic episodes and be in lala land for days until this wonderful pill came into my life I have never felt better I just never felt so good Im happy
4077,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,40689,122,Seroquel XR has changed my life I feel I am present again in my world Before taking this medication I had very little hope that I would ever feel enthusiastic about life I recognize myself again I cant say enough about how excited I am about living I tried so many therapies and had given up hope anything would work The combination of my antidepressant and Seroquel XR was the key for me
4078,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40625,32,I suffer from bipolar OCD very severe anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder I had been in a mental hospital and had taken so many medicines I could never stop thinking to the point where I stayed awake all night Mood swings temper just raving mad waiting to be set off Some medicines worked for a short time and others just didnt work So my psychologist put me on Lamictal but it works very slowly and you have to start it on a low dose and work your way up I had taken it before but my other doctor left and every other doctor wanted to put me on Lithium but I said no because I have Lupus But when he put me on Seroquel XR well thats when things began to look a little bit brighter It does make you sleepy but its a great medicine at least for me anyway Hope this helps
4080,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40577,23,I had a quotnervous breakdownquot in November of and ended up in a psych hospital where I was promptly given Seroquel among other medicines The Seroquel was amazing I felt like someone switched the on button in my brain and I finally woke up When I got out of the hospital and sought out a new psychiatrist for treatment he took me off of the Seroquel because I am diabetic After a year of unsuccessful treatment with other medicines I begged to be put back on the Seroquel because the depression was unbearable and I wasnt responding to other medicines So he agreed and once again that switch has been flipped on and I feel quotnormalquot I am only on mg I have to take it early because it knocks me out In the morning I am very dizzy and have slurred speech
4082,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40524,58,All I can say it that it is a miracle medicine I finally have my life back There are side effects but it is worth it I am in college and doing well My doctors said that would never happen for me They said that I would be in and out of the psych ward I have not need to be in hospital in over five years I can finally hold a job Like I said I have my life back something I was told would never happen Seroquel XR is that reason for that Regular Seroquel is great too it just made me sleep for hours a day Seroquel XR makes me sleepy but I no longer over sleep Again I say I got my life back
4084,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,10,40470,101,I was on Seroqyel for two years and loved it except at the beginning was very sleepy but went away after a few weeks Very shaky but rather than that was wonderful I am drug free and loving it today though easy to go off it too
4085,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40448,25,After much trial an error with other medications I am pleased to find that Seroquel XR really helps I take mg per day Started at but worked my way up until I felt betterWish I had discovered this years ago
4086,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,1,40446,19,I only took this evening it put me to sleep This was one of the strongest medicines Ive taken I was put on mg I felt horrible the next day couldnt concentrate to read felt more depressed had to go back to bed in the morning and felt horrible the whole day Luckily my Doctor said I could quit it
4087,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,40408,25,Was put on this medication for mood stabilization as well as for sleep At the lowest dose it made me excessively drowsy the next day As for the mood stabilization all it did there was make me have violent outbursts while on the medication
4088,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40366,12,I have been taking Seroguel XR for less then a year It seems to work better for me I take mg in the morning then mg at night This helps me very much
4091,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,6,40315,26,Excellent for sleep onset up to a point If things get really bad Ive had to augment it with temazepam and Valium I also have depression I was on and off it for about months and it causes brain fog and word retrieval problems There is also a significant increase in appetite but its not as bad as Remeron
4092,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40301,61,At I simply couldnt take the depression the mania the ADD or the severe anxiety attacks anymore I finally went to the doctor and she put me on Seroquel XR starting at mg for days then mg for days and now the maintenance dosage of mgs It has honestly changed my life and saved my marriage My brain seems to function normally now My nearly constant suicide thoughts are gone and I can concentrate on tasks for more than seconds at a time I would rather have a healthy appetite than feeling nauseous so that side effect only boosts my moods The only thing I dont like is my dreams are VIVID but not in a nightmare sort of way Ive begun dreaming in color which is also new I can certainly live with that
4093,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40294,53,I was diagnosed Bipolar with psychotic features years ago but always dealt with grandiose thinking mild delusions a good deal of depression After self medicating for two years I had a mental melt down and after spending months cooped up in my apartment anorexic dying I decided it was time to see a psychiatrist The medications I was prescribed ranged from mood stabilizers to antipsychotics benzos sleeping pills many I was allergic to like Depakote and Trileptal Anyway at first I tried the regular Seroquel but gained lbs in one month and slept hours a day Switched to Seroquel XR not as tired lost bs appetite mental noise decreased panic relief strong sleep aide life manageable they are expensive HIGHLY recommend
4095,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,40259,47,It helps Will make you feel better about yourself
4096,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40246,35,Seroquel XR has been a blessing for me I currently take mg at night I have suffered from terrible insomnia but with this medicine I actually get some sleep at night As far as anxiety goes it works wonders for me It totally wiped out my anxiety and I was able to get off of Lithium In my opinion it works wonderful for mania but I wish it helped a little more with my depression I take mg of Prozac to boost that I did gain some weight but the benefits outweigh this problem Overall I think it is a wonderful medicine I would recommend it highly
4098,Seroquel XR,Depression,5,40199,30,The drug is good at making one feel good but the weight gain is bad
4100,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,9,40148,100,Causes a little tiredness but completely eliminates anxiety and provides an excellent nights sleep mg at night
4101,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,9,40131,60,I completely support the first review I have had insomnia for many years and tried everything from herbs to drugs And only this could help and provide a good rest during the night I have already taken this medication for over years about mg not more It is enough to get hours with no dreams sleep
4103,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,40114,16,Ive only been on Seroquel XR for days so its hard to tell long term side effects It definitely makes me calmer and allows me to handle difficult or stressful situations more appropriately not crying at the drop of a hat or feeling extreme anxiety I am only on mg at bedtime but Im not completely so hoping to increase that dose a bit when I see my doc next I do get headaches and have lost my appetite still havent lost any weight though I am hoping for the best
4105,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,40103,41,It seems to be very helpful for my depression anxiety adult ADD and overall mood Seroquel XR also seems to have no noticeable side effects and I sleep great Ive been taking of the mg in the evening now for months
4106,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,9,40079,102,I have suffered insomnia for many years and have tried numerous drugs on this list Most of which failed to provide any relief After just one dose of Seroquel XR I slept a full hours and even took a nap during the day My mood has changed and I feel so much healthier now that I am able to get good sound NORMAL sleep Two thumbs up for Seroquel XR I highly recommend you discuss this drug with your physician if you are having CHRONIC trouble sleeping NOT casual sleeping problems It has changed my life I hope this helps some other insomniacs out there who have been suffering for years the way I had been BEST OF LUCK to all of you
4107,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40070,13,Love this medication I take it with two other mood stabilizers an antidepressant and another when required antipsychotic This works wonders I do not get tired on it and I typically take mg I have gone up to mg before when needed Definitely chills me out I do not get akathisia on this one like I do all the other antipsychotics Overall just wonderful If you have had issues with akathisia before on other medicines this would be the one to try
4108,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40054,71,I have heard all kinds of bad things about Seroquel but to me this medicine has saved my life I was diagnosed with cyclothymia with racing thoughts and extreme hypomanic phases followed by intense depression Not to mention I would get so paranoid sometimes that I couldnt leave the house I had tried everything including lithium but then I went to a new doctor She said I could try Seroquel XR but I probably wouldnt like feeling sedated I said sedated fine The funny thing is that I have had more energy but it is calm positive energy I made a huge turn around and life is back on track I thought I had ADHD as well but now I have great concentration no anxiety and can sit still for hours I highly recommend if your symptoms sound like mine
4109,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,10,40039,23,Works well sedating though
4110,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,40035,18,I have been on Seroquel XR for about month I am happier and sleep better
4111,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40033,27,Great medication for agitation and sleep when taken in the evening There is a bit of a hangover period for a couple of hours but that is acceptable to me for a full nights sleep Much better than regular Seroquel which you better be near a bed soon after taking it Seroquel XR is much smoother and gives me a chance to adjust to the sedation as I get ready for bed
4112,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,39993,27,I think this is one of the best medications out there at this time It has really changed me I have bipolar and I cant tell you how happy I am I have also been on regular Seroquel and there is no comparison XR for me works far better than the regular
4113,Seroquel XR,Post Traumatic Stress Disorde,10,39991,47,This medication is very effective in relieving post traumatic stress disorder but has side effects like high blood sugar high blood pressure high cholesterol lack of bladder control
4114,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,39973,19,Seroquel did not work for me I went up to mg and felt like a zombie Now Ive taken Seroquel XR for years Ive seen my anxiety level go to normal But it is necessary for me to plan the time I take the medication to avoid slurred speech in the morning it needs to be in my system at least hours it seems Constipation is severe enough to take laxatives everyday My husband has to keep reminding me the positives outweigh the side effects by far Then I stop and think and know that is true
4116,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,39933,17,I just started taking Seroquel XR a week ago after a bad experience with Geodon So far so good I feel more quotlaid backquot on Seroquel and it helps me sleep which is good for me because I have bad insomnia Im only taking mg now but notice no ill effects Time will tell if I need to take more
4117,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,39913,50,I was put on this medicine very aggressively mg quickly upped to mg after a suicide attempt As an antidepressant it is more effective than the first line medications like citalopram And will help with sleep and a lack of hunger However I absolutely hate the side effectsIt is often said that antipsychotics quotsteal your soulquot or act like a quotmental prisonquot I would have to agree To begin with this was fine with severe depression I was happy to take any way out However after about months of this I decided enough was enoughNow Im off it my personality is back
4118,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,4,39883,23,Worked for mood stabilization but side effects were not acceptable There were vivid and sometimes nightmares also weight gain
4119,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,3,39868,13,I found that it made me very tired and was not very useful
4120,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,5,39851,40,This medicine will make you fat and happy
4121,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,7,39816,30,I like this medicine Even the side effects are manageable I get loopy on them but that is better than the screaming drama queen I once was I take mg and have a psychiatrist and a councellor who that helps me through situations that I used to rage through Also Im a rapidcycling BiPolar II so I think its wonderful just to be able to be somewhat normal
4123,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,39678,94,For years I suffered from severe depression doctors must have tried every different medicine of this nature in hopes to help me however it wasnt until I was given seroquel that I began to feel better and sleep like a baby At first I would sleep to hours after taking the medicine then I began to get used to it I havent had a bout of depression in years I can sleep again but now around hours a night I can honestly say I love this pill Even with the side effects of hunger its totally worth it
4124,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,39657,113,Everyday I was very depressed or very angery for no apparant reason It felt like my brain was all tangled and it was really hurting me and had been for years So I talked with my doctor and she put me on mg seroquel Since then I can think clearly and feel happy I love it You start at mg and work up to higher doses Watch out though if you try to start at mg it can knock you out for hrs or at least it knocked me out
4125,Nafarelin,Endometriosis,7,40147,4,Synarel worked well for preventing endometriosis but some of the side effects appear to be irreversible Since taking this drug over years ago I gained pounds while on the prescription which I have been unable to lose and also developed a bad case of rosacea during that time Definitely check out the possible side effects before taking any medication
4126,Nafarelin,Endometriosis,10,39521,7,Synarel has been a god send for me in many ways It helped with pain and had much fewer side effects than depo lupron I felt like myself again while taking the synarel and it helped suppress the endo for over years
4129,Junel Fe 24,Birth Control,10,42877,2,I had been on Loestrin which switched to LomediaFE on for about years and after finding out that the manufacturer was backordered until April I threw in the towel and stopped calling pharmacies within a mile radius of me haha My doctor wrote my new RX for Microgestin and Junel was what showed up at Walgreens I take it at night before bed and for all I know Im still takin Lomedia I havent experienced any side effects which I am so grateful for
4130,Junel Fe 24,Birth Control,8,42864,0,Im reading all these terrible reviews and I feel like my experience is almost exactly opposite Its not perfect but Im pretty happy with the birth control I do struggle with anxiety and depression but if anything Ive noticed a quotlevelling outquot over the past month of taking Junel Im on the iron pills this week though and Ive noticed my appetite go through the roof I was really confused until I went to take the pill this morning and it all made sense My skin has improved a little which Im a little impressed with in only a months time Ive suffered from cystic acne for years I did spot a little in week and then again for a day in week but my period is much lighter than normal and Ive heard that it regulates in a few months time
4131,Junel Fe 24,Birth Control,5,42796,0,Only been on this about a month but Im not pregnant so thats good But in the beginning I did have diarrhea and abdominal pain I had very light spotting barely anything at all I do believe this has made me gain some weight tho which I do not like but other than that I feel fine mentally
4132,Nilstat,Oral Thrush,8,42023,28,The Nilstat cleared up the white spots in my mouth within days and my throat was less sore so that I could start eating solid food for the first time since radiation treatment weeks On the third bottle but have not fully cleared all the thrush from my throat I have had Chemo radiation and heaps of antibiotics so I am a hard case for it
4133,Nilstat,Oral Thrush,10,41797,28,My daughter has to use this for thrush that her other medications cause It helps a lot
4134,Norvir,HIV Infection,1,42779,0,I was prescribed Norvir along with Truvada and Prezista as a substitute for Atripla My physician felt that it would increase my CD count which had stabilized for some time at the range I began the regimen with Norvir and the other antivirals in September and checked the progress in December months The CD count had declined to and the new treatment was clearly not effective He had me retested at the end of January and the count had fallen to I have since gone back to AtriplaNorvir has a serious contraindication when combined with a steroid I have been using Advair for COPD and the Norvir reacted with the fluoxetine in Advair and caused my face to become puffy weight gain and stomach issues
4135,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40428,58,I recently underwent radiation therapy for uterine cancer It made my IBS predominately diarrhea x worse It was so bad I couldnt eat anything without making me feel sicker My oncologist suggest Imodium which didnt work until she added Lomotil to the Imodium Together it works and I can do activities without worrying about another episode
4136,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40385,2,Ive been taking this medicine for colitis for years and now I can take my daughters out by myself Im not running to the bathroom or having accidents its wonderful I do have constipation So anyone with colitis should try it I take pills in the morning then every hours everyday and Im loving life finally
4137,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,7,40375,19,I had my colon removed due to Ulcerative Colitis and have been running to the bathroom regularly I was taking Lomotil a day and still going times a day
4139,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,2,40300,25,I am taking Lomotil because I had surgery Then bone infection set in and I had to take IV antibiotics which caused extensive diarrhea The first day I took Lomotil it worked great for about hours but the following days decreased in its effectiveness By the third day it was no longer working for me but I attribute this to the antibiotics I will have to let my doctor know so that he can possibly prescribe another antidiarrhea medicine or change my antibiotic
4140,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,8,40163,30,I was in hospital for Severe Ulcerative Colitis I was so bad I was going to times a day Right now I have no insurance but can afford Lomotil and it has me slowed down to to times a day which I love and can more than live with It does say it can blur your vision but so can diabetes and I take so much predisone it makes my sugar stay high all day too
4141,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40133,67,I have many things wrong with me one of them being IBS I was having such a hard time carrying out my daily routines because I would be in the bathroom most of the time My stomach hurt real bad too It was so bad I had to go to the Urgent Health Care then the hospital They could not find anything abnormal in my blood work or my CAT scan so the doctor prescribed these Within days I was feeling great Now I am on them all the time because that is how severe my condition is but it makes life a lot easier It takes away the stomach cramping and I only have a bowel movement like times a day compared to
4144,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,3,40056,15,It made me constipated for days
4148,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,39819,53,I started to take Lonox once I was diagnosed with IBS Before I started the pill I was always in the bathroom Everything I ate made me sick I was afraid to leave my house eat out and just go out in general When I would get my ldquoattacksrdquo I felt as if I had no control over my body If I had to go I HAD TO GO There was no such thing as waiting until I got home I started to map out public bathrooms that I felt comfortable enough in just in cause I had an emergency on the road and had to go Irsquove felt as if Lonox has given me my life back Irsquom able to go out on long trips eat out and be me again with out fearing an ldquoemergencyrdquo I was directed to take pills times a day but it made me constipated and I would cramp pretty bad What works for me is taking the pills once a day in the morning I always go to the bathroom within frac hr of taking the pill but at least itrsquos predictable now and I stay regulated Some days I have to take the pill twice but never more than that
4149,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,39729,26,It worked within a few days
4150,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,39705,21,Works really fast
4151,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,39698,61,Really works fast and without any side effects Seems to clear up persistant and ongoing diarrhea overnight Taking the tiny tablets is much better than dealing with liquids
4152,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42821,27,I have a long history of IBSD which has grown worse in the past few years after undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer The diarrhea has become severe and daily and without lomotil I could rarely leave my house It has helped tremendously and I dont seem to have any significant side effects I try to take no more than one pill a day in the morning and it usually keeps me diarrheafree until late afternoon depending on what I eat for lunch Some days it holds me all day I am very grateful for this drug because nothing else Ive tried has worked at all
4153,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,1,42773,2,I have had severe diahrrea for months every morning bowel movements and this was of no help up dose to twice no change now going for more medical testings
4154,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,8,42745,15,I have been taking Lomotil since I had surgery to repair a fistula in my intestines I have crohns and am yr old male The Lomotil has made it somewhat bearable and I have not had as many bouts of liquid feces since taking Not a miracle drug but does help in a tremendous way I suggest that you try it if you have disease that I have Cannot stress NOT MIRACLE DRUG BUT DOES HELP TREMENDOUSLY
4155,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,1,42689,9,If youre sensitive to any medication I dont recommend taking I had an adverse reaction and it caused me to end up in the ER I started out taking one dose and then began feeling anxious after several hours Against my better judgement I took a second dose and the next morning felt nauseous which then led to vomiting that wouldnt stop and severe anxiety It also caused my heart rate to increase I had to be treated for dehydration and nausea as well as something to calm my heart rate An FYI I found out the hard way that Imodium AD also has similar effects on my body I guess Ill try and go a more natural route
4156,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42684,1,I am taking chemo Dr prescribed it Usually diarrhea next week Tue amp Wed Had that but also Thu morn it was terrible for amphr Took med in middle of all amp it got better Only pill as prescribed So glad it stopped it No side effects
4157,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42410,46,Ive had ulcerative colitis since with severe abdominal cramping and spasms with and without diarrhea After numerous attempts with other medications I found lomotil to be most effective at controlling symptoms without the side effects of other medications such as flushing I can take lomotil tabs at the onset of abdominal symptoms and abort attacks of diarrhea It also works for cramping caused by spasms of the intestinal wall preventing feces from being expelled Doctors are amazed that Ive lived with this disease for so long without surgery steroids or sulfa drugs My key is managing my stress level which is very helpful overall and lomotil which aborts diarrhea and alleviates cramping A miracle drug for me
4158,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42408,36,I have taken Lomotil for years in the am amp in the pm which controls my diarrhea except I am good for sixeight weeks and then for whatever reason it doesnt work for a week or so I even up my dosage but it doesnt help thankfully the Lomotil starts working again Just wish I didnt have the time it doesnt work
4159,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42332,15,I had diarrhea several times a week and especially when we went out I felt housebound After beginning dosages of Lonox I was more comfortable able to travel and able eat out Because of these improvements in my health I also am more secure in leaving my house
4160,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42315,9,Nothing worked but this drug
4161,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42270,44,Most effective antidiarrhea med Ive ever takenafter years of explosive chronic diarrhea
4162,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42225,61,Other than Tincture of Opium Lomotil is the best thing for controlling diarrhea Because the Opium is so expensive I often can take only lomotil and it works at the maximum dosage and more to slow down my diarrhea Without it I would have nothing to live for literally It is a lifesaver
4163,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42124,79,Ive had IBS for years but when I had colon surgery years ago I started to really have problems with chronic severe diarrhea to xs a day I was miserable leaking wearing Depends just depressed about no solution Finally I found a doctor who prescribed Lomotil tabs xs a day and it worked And without any side effects Im now down to or doses a day and feeling so much better
4165,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,8,41965,6,Had a bout of what I was beginning to think was food poisoning Long story short I landed in the ER This was prescribed for me along with antibiotics I have taken exactly one pill one a little over hours ago Have gone from extreme diarrhea every minutes to not being able to go at all From one dose Does this stuff work as advertised Unequivocally Yes I am a bit nervous at this point as to whether I will ever be able to go again I have to admit yes
4167,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,41431,13,I have had severe diarrhea since I was years old After countless other trials on different medications with no success I was finally put on Lomotil It has changed my life I no longer have to go or times a day or constantly arrange my schedule around my problem I have been on it for years now and unfortunately was misinformed by a former GI doctor that it was no different than Imodium or I would have tried it earlier Very effective
4168,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,41394,137,This medication has been a God send Before I knew about this medication I was in and out of the bathroom at least times in one day and it was every time I put food in my mouth That went on for a full year I couldnt go anywhere without going to the bathroom first and if I was out and about I couldnt eat anything until I got home Me and my wife couldnt even go out to eat on our anniversary because of my problem It was taking over my life and I was getting depressed but then my doctor gave me Lomotil and it works like a charm Instead of going to the bathroom after each time I put food in my mouth I now only go about times a day and I can now eat at restaurants now Ihis medication put reassurance back in my life again
4169,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,3,41094,25,Lomotil made me extremely drowsy and nauseous I thought it was my stomach infection it only happened every hours and after I took the pill
4171,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40915,96,I was having to go plus times a day and started to lose weight because every time I ate I had to run to the bathroom So now with the Lomotil I go maybe three times a day and I only have to take of these a day which is nice in the morning after the first trip to the bathroom and after each extra trip which only ends up to be two more times at the most This is the one medicine I dont want to live without
4172,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40813,119,Lomotil has been a complete blessing for me Imodium did not touch my severe diarrhea I suffer from depression anxiety panic attacks and agoraphobia With these symptoms caused severe stomach problems When given Lomotil for a possible chance it might help I am now living without being in the bathroom every hour I found no side effects I cannot even tell you the difference it has made When I do have to leave home I have no worries about finding where the bathroom is before I even proceed to do what I have to do YES This is one miracle in my life that brings some normality to scratch off my list of problems I can even eat out at restaurants now
4174,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40667,11,I am a veteran I suffer from PTSD severe anxiety disorder agoraphobia deathly fear of leaving my home and within the last years IBS My diarrhea was truly horrid IBS topped with severe anxiety is unfathomable I went through every test possible including CT Scans and multiple colonoscopies just looking for some reason any reason for the constant times spent literally in a panicked run to the bathroom They didnt reveal a thing except that you are not immune to having an episode just because you are in a CT machine very embarrassing I changed my medicines around and wound up with the opportunity to try Atropine without nasty interactions It has not completely cured me but it is by far the best Ive tried and I have been on many medicines
4177,Temsirolimus,Renal Cell Carcinoma,9,42384,2,Ive been taking med for two years Dont have any side effects and the cancer isnt increasing Dont take antinausea med or benedril any more
4179,Goodys Headache Powders,Migraine,10,42668,0,Ive taken Goodys Powers and BC Powers off and on for decades It really does work Its bad for the stomach but most all these medicinesdrugsprescriptions are bad for the stomach It works quickly amp affectivelyWithin minutes or less you will feel the pain subside I prefer it over the bottles of headache meds It would be nice it it came in the form of tablets capsules even gels If wanting to try just put the power on the back of your tongue and swallow with a glass of sweet tea or juice It makes it bearable for those that dont like the taste or cant stand it I usually drink water but Im accustomed to it That reminds me theres Standback Powers also Try not to take more than is actually needed less is better

4184,Codeine,Pain,10,40146,11,I was prescribed codeine when my wisdom teeth were taken out This should only be used for extreme and chronic pain It made me feel completely out of it I was dizzy and felt like I had a brick on my chest the entire time while I was using it
4185,Codeine,Pain,1,40144,19,My dentist prescribed it to me to treat a toothache and its completely useless
4188,Codeine,Cough,10,39983,17,I could barely breath or eat when I had bronchitis When I took codeine I could at least drink water and eat noodles I dont know how I would have survived without it Although I had to quit taking it before I finished my prescription because it made me feel quotdrunkquot if I dont have major pain
4189,Codeine,Pain,10,39841,59,Very effective I have osteoarthritis and can be pain free with Codeine It is more effective with Ibuprofen ALSOprofoundly lifts depression due to chronic pain and makes such a better life day to day Space doses well apart to avoid tolerance I use only in the morning with very good effect Using whole daily dose in the morning may get you through the day without a need for a second dose I would leave at least hours between doses to assure full effectDont suffer needlessly Good luck and hope this helps
4190,Codeine,Diarrhea,10,39784,40,I have severe IBS Irritable Bowel Syndrome and could not find relief until I was prescribed codeine for it At this point most of my symptoms are either completely gone or nearly goneI can say that codeine is a wonder drug when it comes to resolving the symptoms
4192,Codeine,Pain,5,39657,32,I take this drug for my back pain with other pain killers and I find this drug very good
4193,Codeine,Pain,9,39651,27,I was in hospital for some time with chest pains and when I was given codeine phosphate it took the pain straight away I also suffer from back pain and codeine phosphate really works I would recommend it

4197,Acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide,Migraine,10,40771,4,I cannot say enough good things about this medication I have suffered from migraines for years I have taken every over the counter medicine there is to take for migraine pain and beyond I have also taken prescription medicines that really wipe me out I got a migraine at work one day and went to our first aid kit to see if they had anything I could take I found some pain aid and took it and could not believe how fast it worked It took my migraine away within minutes I have referred others to this medication and they have had the same reaction I cant buy this at in stores in our area but the person who stocks our first aid kit said he can sell it to me Yay
4198,Acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide,Migraine,10,40180,7,I buy PainAids brand at local QuikTrip thats about the only place I know to buy painaids A box of packages with painaids in each package is They are the best for relieving headaches and other pains They do not upset my stomach even on an empty one I have tried many pain killers even prescription and these are by far the best Easy to purchase if there is a Quik Trip nearby because I have not found them in Walmart Kmart or any other drug store Once I found them at a health food store in Akron Ohio which was great because I couldnt find a QuikTrip It has all ingredients aspirin acetaminophen caffeine salicylamide I give the highest rating
4199,Acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide,Pain,5,40050,4,I work at a doctors office and was given a sample of this for a migraine Im supposed to be taking preventative medicine for migraines but dont like the side effects This did take a lot of the pain away decreasing it to I suppose youd say a moderate headache and I was able to get through my day But when it wore off the full migraine came right back The only downside is the pill got lodged in my throat and I nearly choked on it Its really large I can take a one a day vitamin every morning with no problems theyre fairly big So its not that I have trouble swallowing
4200,Blephamide,Conjunctivitis Bacterial,10,42510,1,This was a wonder drug for me I live outdoors a lot and I sweat a lot and so I get bacterial conjunctivitis about once every months If I apply just a couple drops when I feel my eyes first getting itchy this stuff makes it go away overnight A couple more in the morning and I am good to go for the next months If however the eyes get red before you realize you have the conjunctivitis then it might take multiple applications to make it go away but it will in a matter of a couple days Very good stuff High priced but not so much that its unaffordable
4202,Codeine,Diarrhea,9,43054,0,Suffered from Lower Anterior Resection Syndrome for years Especially needing to empty my bowels every to hours during the night Codeine was the only thing that stopped this and allowed me to have uninterrupted sleep Lomotil or Imodium did nothing
4203,Codeine,Pain,10,43049,0,I have been taking codeine yrs with diazepam amp Tylenol I can no longer take antiinflammatories too unfortunately I have a huge tolerance regularly taking mg a day tablets On pain free days I need to take a tablet about every hrs or withdrawal starts after about That is a bit like having a dose of flu for a few days combined with severe diarrhoea in my case During rare painfree periods it isnt worth weaning myself off completely cos the pain is never away longEveryone different mg gives me hrs max relief No constipation dizziness or nauseathe latter often experienced briefly on st use inc posters here dose probs too big Constipation is common amp worse than the pain Im told so go easy
4206,Codeine,Pain,1,42540,2,I had an external hemorrhoids surgery and codeine not helping me whatsoever as the doctor prescribed mg I take still same and has not helped me with tonsillitis surgery too
4207,Codeine,Cough,10,42461,6,more than a decade of a horrible chronic cough doc put me on codeine and whatever damage it might be doing to my body it has been well worth it I have had to increase dosage considerably but so far I have not become immune thank god because I dont want to live coughing like I have in the past No side effects that are negative
4208,Codeine,Diarrhea,9,42435,11,bowel resections due to crohns disease I now have short bowel syndrome with chronic diarrhea I have tried every antidiarrheral drug there is and the only one that has helped is codeine I consider it a wonder drug for my condition enabling me to lead a mostly normal life I have taken the same amount everyday for years I dont feel quothighquot but do feel slightly drowsy occasionally I did have a period of months where I stopped taking it and while I did have some physical symptoms not mental in stopping they were not too bad the symptom relief I had on the drug far outweighed the negatives I continue to take and it makes my life easier
4209,Codeine,Pain,9,42421,8,When I got my wisdom teeth pulled out by my dentist he prescribed me mg Codeine x daily along with Promethazine mg x daily He couldnt prescribe me Norco Percocet or any other Narcotic that contained NSAIDs ESP APAP Tylenol because I have liver problems It worked great At first the Codeine wasnt enough but when I got a script for Promethazine on top of the Codeine it worked WONDERS Killed all the pain I was real happy because I didnt need a dose raise from the Narcotic Codeine is an excellent pain medication for moderate pain
4210,Codeine,Pain,10,42396,5,Great It works well for pain but does not last as long as Id like I cant take hydrocondone which make me itch and sometimes break out in night sweats
4211,Codeine,Pain,9,42386,10,Fantastic would be suffering with out I take cocodamol for tooth ache that Im getting work on and having to wait a while for referral to go through But this really does make the pain vanish in about minutes Only down side is it can make you feel very drowsy and very slight stomach ache but I take to help me sleep as thats when the pain is at its worst and it does help you sleep Also causes constipation and the pain free moments only last a few hours
4212,Codeine,Pain,3,42363,4,Brought on a wicked toothache like Ive never had before
4214,Codeine,Pain,8,42282,7,I had of my wisdom teeth taken out this past August My dentist prescribed me codeine and ibuprofen Whenever I took the codeine my pain level was very low so Id say it worked pretty well The only reason I didnt give a ten is because it did make me extremely nauseous at one point
4215,Codeine,Pain,10,42244,16,lI was lucky to have had a Dr that did research with codeine for Narcolepsy Codeine has a paradoxil effect in Narcoleptics It works better than any stimulants to not only be able to stay awake but aware without the awful side effects of a stimulant such as jitteriness I Am able to read do paper work budget money drive things that require concentration that are otherwise extremely difficult and hard to do and get right Codeine has allowed me to be able to do things I wouldnt be able to do anymore on just stimulants Gives me some life back Having Narcolepsy is like having to watch life go by in a dream it steels your ability to participate in life Slowly built a tolerance otherwise no problems at all

4218,Codeine,Pain,10,41533,27,After morphine this would probably be the best pain reliever I know of I have never had any dizziness blurred vision or sleepiness but thats probably just me Fantastic for wisdom teeth also
4221,Codeine,Pain,9,41297,23,Excellent pain relief for ovarian cancer Only downside terrible constipation that no amount of drinking or eating prunes kiwi fruit or bran made any difference
4222,Codeine,Pain,10,41040,25,I tried paracetamol and ibuprofen but theyre not as effective as codeine Codeine is really helping me for muscle spasm I have as I am suffering from cerebral palsy Im glad I got it prescribed from my GP doctor
4223,Codeine,Pain,9,40904,20,I took codeine every hours when I had a broken arm Codeine worked well and took the pain away in about to minutes after taking it but the pain started coming back again after about hours

4255,Belviq,Weight Loss,6,42992,20,Ive been taking Belviq for over a year and have lost over lbs Im no longer taking my antidepressants either because I call it my little happy pill However they keep raising the price and I can no longer afford it Im sick of drug companies and they games they play with peoples lives
4262,Belviq,Obesity,10,42960,27,I began this medication a few days ago and its been a Godsend thus far My main problem in the past has been nocturnal eating Id wake up barrel down to the kitchen and whilst half asleep devour PBampJ pasta whatevertheheck was in the fridge Thats gone As a result Ive been sleeping through the night I dont often feel hungry and when I do I control my portions with ease No nausea or headaches yet I felt a bit quotstrangequot my first day on it but that may have been a result of not feeling hungry of the time I was also slightly lightheaded my second day may have been a result of reduced caloric intake Ive yoyoed a lot and finally feel that the monkey is slipping off my back RECOMMENDED
4263,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42959,15,I have lost pounds over the last years I used Belviq as one part of my process It definitely helped reduce my hunger and I didnt experience the side effects some people describe But it only worked for me if I stayed with my plan Weight Watchers for keeping track of weight loss weighing my self every day exercising about minutes every day What I have learned is that there is no quotdietingquot It is a life long process of accepting that I cannot live like I had been and finding great ways to enjoy food and movement not a life long deprivation a lifelong change for the better I wiill continue to take Belviq I gave it out of because it is a month and that is a significant amount for me
4264,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42958,12,I started my journey on Unfortunately I am very limited to my exercise routine due to a car accident I changed the way I eat and I try to eat healthier and smaller portions I so far am down lbs I am hoping I keep losing With the discount card its free no copay for me

4267,Belviq,Weight Loss,3,42952,9,I took this drug for approximately days I experienced headache nauseousiness diarrhea dizziness EXTREME fatigue insomnia Stopped taking it so wasted

4276,Belviq,Obesity,1,42931,4,Ive been taking BELVIQ for almost months without any weight loss I have been eating healthy meals and walking about a mile and more practically every day Why wont the weight start falling off Please help Tat
4277,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42927,33,This has been good for losing weight I was skeptical at first because of all of the reported side effects and the costs I checked with my pharmacy and found that my insurance paid all but for it and the manufacturer will send you a card to cover the rest There was ZERO cost for me to try this First the side effects I had them all Tired joint pains back pain feeling foggy It was bad Everything subsided within the first weeks The back pain still remains but not as bad Now results I started the drug on at pounds As of I am down to pounds I walk daily and dont feel like eating too much My cravings for sugar soda and fast food is all but gone My weight loss is slowing now though
4278,Belviq,Weight Loss,4,42924,12,I took it for a week The first days brought a headache amp then that resolved I was also a bit nauseous those days I did notice that I had almost no appetite right away so apparently it is effective for satiation I had to stop taking it though because of the following Cough started immediately amp resolved the day after I stopped taking itDizziness amp difficulty with balanceDeep sleep amp trouble getting going in the morning when the dizziness was worseSneezing amp sore throat Now this may sound like maybe I just had a cold but I didnt I am a nurse and I know the differenceSome difficulty with memory amp concentrationDry mouth but that is no big dealAnother deterrent for me is that I cant take my migraine med with it
4279,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42919,14,So not worth it I had all kinds of bad effects on the drug but I am here to warn you about stopping it My doctor told me to stop it cold turkey I figured since it was a selective SSRI I didnt have to taper I have spent the next six weeks with profound problems with my heart rhythm Which my doctor thinks is unrelated After weeks things seem to be calming a bit But not after all kinds of tests and a halter monitor and of course that looks like your crazy I know it was this drug The only time I ever had them before was after discontinuing Celexa without tapering when it was first introduced and they didnt know better I dont have palpitations normally There is no good information on this drug You are just winging it
4280,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42916,21,Started May st have lost pounds as of today June th Changed eating habits not much exercise yet but is coming soon per month Used a coupon on line only took off dollars Does anyone know one that will work Insurance doesnt pay for mine Please help I want to continue on this journey but takes a chunk out of the budget
4281,Belviq,Obesity,7,42901,19,The drug works I needed to exercise Without exercise I experience headaches and weird dreams But when I get out and walk I feel much much better and the weight comes off faster to I went from lb down to lb and my enthusiasm for walking and finally hitting the gym increased I lost all the cravings and especially the feeling that Im hungry all the time That helped me get started Then eating very little each day and exercising is the key HOWEVER dont stop taking the drug cold turkey I did that and I turned lethargic and my hunger and cravings for fast food doughnuts ice cream and sugary drinks hit twice as hard and I gained back pounds Now I have to start all over
4283,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42900,36,I started taking Belviq May I am quot and start weight was lb Today makes day and I am at lb and thats the number with my period on sorry TMI so it will be lower once its gone off I know lbs in days sounds like nothing right But I havent exercised nor watched what I have been eating only because I wanted to see what the pill had to offer Not only did I lose weight but I lost inches How many inches Im not sure I just know that I can wear my rompers and tight shirts without my girdle
4286,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42896,44,I started this pill on Tuesday night My insurance paid for it after preauthorization from my Dr my co pay was but pharmacist referred me to website and coupon paid that so I thought what the hell Ill try it I am and on Monday I weighed On Thursday I weighed so full days on medication I lost lbs I started my diet one strict calorie diet and now I am so full I feel sick if I eat more than about but my husband makes me eat The only side effect I have had from it is insomnia so I take mg at am mg at pm No side effects now I absolutely love it
4290,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42886,43,I have been on Belviq for nearly months I take mg twice daily My BMI was in the Obese range I never had a single sideeffect Not one I have lost pounds The medication just took away my cravings I never even want dessert and have no desire for sweetsSadly I am not an exercise person so Ive done very little of that Some people might think that pounds indicates a slow weight loss in that length of time but I am thrilled By the way I just eat normal food but much smaller portions I just get full very quickly Im sorry some people have had problems or side effects For me it was a life saver I still have more to lose but Ill get there Then I have to figure out how to keep it off
4292,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42886,14,Belviq works great for an appetite suppressant I experienced a little dizziness and a couple first days I had slight chills could be coincidental But times I took it with AllegraD and had a horrible headache the kind where you think you might pukemigraine status I truly believe it was just the combination of the pseudoephedrine and the Belviq Ive never had a headache when I take it with Benadryl I have bad spring allergies
4293,Belviq,Obesity,8,42885,14,So I started Belviq a few weeks ago I sometimes had headaches but nothing a few advil wouldnt cure It took about weeks for the medicine to start working You have to be patient and remember this is a serotonin drug it affects the serotonin in your brain which controls hunger and feeling of fullness Its just like when you take medicine for depression anxiety OCD they take time to work I was very surprised I did not have any side effects to speak of because I am super sensitive to medication I am less hungry and I do not find myself thinking of food all the time I have lost pounds thus far and am hoping to continue losing weight
4294,Belviq,Obesity,3,42884,5,Ive been on Belviq for days and have felt nothing I havent felt the urge to eat less nor any side effects Anybody want to share and let me know when I would start to feel something Thanks
4296,Belviq,Obesity,10,42880,13,The first two days of being on Belviq were rough but after that I knew right away it was worth it My insurance does not cover it but with the coupon it is I did not get a refill thinking I would be fine without it but my weight loss has stalled and I am back to eating how I was before hand even tho Im trying not too My starting weight was and my current weight after one month of taking it is without exercise since I was healing from surgery I just refilled it and will start going to gym with my next paycheck
4297,Belviq,Weight Loss,3,42879,10,When I first started I had bad side effects Such as feeling like a head cold etc Anxiety Trouble seeing Headaches But they did wear off Then I was ok but for really bad cognitive problems Unable to remember things at work Some problems talking But as long as I was losing weight Finally I realized I was having loose stools due to this drug and came close to a couple of accidents That was it I stopped Yikes I had horrible withdrawal Heart Palpitations nausea I am weening off When I got off the drug I dont think I ate anymore but I gained lbs the week after cutting back the dose I found a similar thing when I started for the first two weeks I didnt lose any weight but then lost fast Something is up with that
4298,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,43049,1,dont use this product it burns and continues to burn for days
4299,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,43015,0,I recommend this product if you have pain I would like to say that this is the best of two evilsbecause it burns at the start when you first start to use it It is really important to read the instructions to use it properly But nice to relocate the pain a little For my part the product works very wellHowever if you do not have major pain the product will be worse for youAnyway a great product to measure your pain level
4300,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,42994,0,If I could post a picture of what this cream did to me Picture the worst burning EVER It took several wipes and a shower to get it off my back and it still had bad pain from middle to the tailbone area which was red I was in SO much pain from this medicine it felt like my skin was on fire I tried putting lidocaine spray on it and the the spray just melted onto my skin
4301,Capsaicin,Pain,1,42952,1,Horrible It left me with burns I was up all thro the night trying to get this off of my knees it gave me extreme burning sensations DO NOT RECOMMEND
4303,Capsaicin,Pain,8,42876,2,I was suffering due to sciatic nerve compression not sure it is because of lumbar hernia or piriformis muscle spasm the doc did not mention for long time I used capsaicin patch on my lower back applied only for hours I felt much better the next day
4305,Capsaicin,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1,42867,3,I have peripheral neuropathy in my feet I had the feeling of socks crunched up I used this stuff and I added severe burning I used it days and returned it DONT BUY I now have burning feet It will go away but what kind of cure is burning feet not less pain Also if you get on hands it can cause problems so make sure you wash it off This OTC cream should say SEVERE BURNING FEELING POSSIBLE I never have pain at night when I sleep Last night I had burning feelingTHIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE BANNED
4306,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,1,42851,5,Well have had this treatment about years ago now I was told it was a very new treatment and only one use of it would provide permanent benefits and that it often gave back sensation to extremities in Peripheral Neuropathy for me this was not the case it was in a sheet format a speciased Nurse was doing the treatment cutting into this single sheet by aseptic technique and extra gloves the stinging that it cases to both my hands as in fingers and everywhere the Quitenza touched spent the next days virtually in the bath as skin was burning in PAIN now Pain I can feel unlike even touch seems out of reach apparently it takes up to months to work oh yeh and it is made from Capsicum Chillies
4307,Capsaicin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,1,42837,0,Tried it once hours later still burning unbearably
4309,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,42782,4,Im not sure it helped at all but when I woke up in the middle of the night sweating the burning sensation it caused was intense Very painful An ice pack helped but Im afraid to use again after this
4311,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,8,42707,12,This works for nerve pain but is waaay stronger than Bengay Tiger Balm amp the sort Honestly this should have a more serious alert on the bottle My dr had me start nerve desenitizingi think its called I have two types of nerve pain amp the pain can get real ugly I used a brush on my hamstrings and adductors to quotdensitizequot I was still just going crazy in pain meditatedwell tried Prayed amp am now suffering the consequences of putting Capzasin HP on my Scrubbed legsmaybe min past the scrubbing Honestly this pain rivals my nerve painawful close anyway Good product but BE careful wkids pets older folks amp especially people in crazy pain undertreated by a propaganda driven war on pain medicine amp the Pain Drs
4312,Capsaicin,Pain,1,42630,14,I used this for the first time last night and within one minute my skin felt like I had lit it on fire I followed the directions on the box to remove it but I suffered for hours My skin looked like I had sun poisoning I almost made a trip to the ER Today my skin is still very tender I made a bad situation much worse Never ever AGAIN
4314,Capsaicin,Pain,9,42594,15,I CAN WALK AGAIN I had so much pain in my right knee and nothing worked Cant take alleve I tried this and put on WAY TOO MUCH the first time Burned liked I was on fire After I use in very mall doses all I can say is IT WORKS Took pain away and I can traverse the stairs and walk with almost NO pain I like this better than taking pain meds I HIGHLY recommend this
4315,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,9,42594,15,I have been suffering from sciatica for about years now It has gradually gotten worse Ibuprofen acetaminophen and naproxin no longer help to relieve the pain in my left thigh I have found that a generic capsaicin patch placed on my lower back relives the pain It doesnt fully disappear but it becomes a lot more bearable
4319,Capsaicin,Pain,10,42563,8,Suffering for over months with Sciatic Nerve and Hamstring pain using Advil mg per hours which just wasnt completely relieving the pain A bottle of Absorbine not Jr produced in was in the medicine cabinet and contains capsaicin along with herbals and other ingredients After application the pain almost immediately was reduced from to about still taking Advil But about the th application of the Absorbine described above noticed pain subsided for a longer period Now we are unable to locate Absorbine with like ingredients Found a creme called Capzicin and it seems to being working satisfactorily times a day along with the mg Advil taken every hrs
4321,Capsaicin,Pain,8,42551,11,I just found out about Capzasin today and tried it for the first time for my fibromyalgia I have OTC and while I have only been using it a few hours I am so excited to have found it The burning sensation is mild compared to my pain and doesnt bother me in the least I tried it on one thigh to start and make sure it didnt bother me too much I had so much relief in the one leg I couldnt wait to use it on the other My only complaint is the smell It has a strong scent of menthol I am in most pain at night when trying to sleep so I think I will use it then I did read that showering can be uncomfortable but also that a milk compress helps
4322,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,10,42514,30,Capsaicin cream works amazingly well for my sciatica I apply on the side of my leg foot lower back or wherever I have painSo the version is too strong You should buy the version at Look for Rugby Capsaicin There is also a product called Zostrix which you can find with Also use plastic gloves to apply You are applying essence of hot peppers to your skin and if you transfer it to your eyes it will really burn It stays on your skin so after hours I scrub the area down with a soapy washcloth It reheats if you sweat or take a bath Without scrubbing it will reactivate if your skin gets wet
4323,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,42465,27,Probably best to do a small patch test before you use this product Also different Capsaicin preparations are more potent than others I have bursitus in my shoulder and it is very painful particularly when I sleep wrong on my shoulder Capsaicin is the only relief I get Now able to sleep through the night yes it burns thats the point it exhausts the pain receptors in the area Best product but you have to expect to burn thats what it does thats how it works
4326,Capsaicin,Pain,10,42443,14,I have bad sciatica Lying in bed was the worst and ive tried every thing Found this amazing capsisin and havent looked back At first i was putting on a fair bit and the burning was unbearable but found that sweating interacts so now i put a tiny bit on and now i have movement
4327,Capsaicin,Pain,9,42434,9,Yes it burns even worse after putting it on at night then waking up and taking a shower in the morning The water hitting it OH MY I used capsaicin patches for nerve damage pain in my rib after a car accident It worked the more you use it the more effective it was I am now using it on my neck cream my PCP told me it is one of those medications that the more you use it the more benefit you will getand the less the burn I am hoping the cream works as well on my neck as the patches did for my rib
4328,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,42423,11,Used it last night for knee pain and it started burning so bad it felt like my skin was melting off I would rather deal with the knee pain than ever use this stuff again
4331,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,8,42226,19,When I lay in bed with osteoarthritis pain and nerve painthis tends to give a warming sensation to a bit burning which takes my mind off the nerve pain and after a bit and with my pain meds I can fall asleep If you like hot showers in the morning it may warm up a bit while in the hot shower I wont live without it I only use it at bed time and when the pain is to great to fall asleep
4333,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,8,42091,26,Works best after a few doses
4334,Capsaicin,Not Listed / Othe,9,41937,22,It does produce a burning sensation the first two weeks After that it is a gentle warming sensation and really eases the pain in my back injury It is absolutely worth putting up with the initial burning sensation
4335,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,9,41916,73,After a spinal injury I began to experience numbness pain and quotpricklyquot feelings in my legs and feet My toes and bottoms of my feet near the toes were and still are completely numb and I have frequent pain and burning in those areas I bought the Capsaicin cream without a prescription at Walmart for I applied it liberally to both feet and massaged the areas well I then put on white ankle socks so I could walk on my wood floors without leaving residue I did not experience any bad side effectsno burning etc The relief from my nerve pain subsided very quickly After about minutes I removed the socks and elevated my legs The medication definitely provided great relief DO wash your hands thoroughly with soap
4336,Capsaicin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,9,41902,29,I am a Dutchman living in The Hague My Post herpetic neuralgia dates from about months ago My physician prescribed kinds of tablets tramadol carbamazepine and paracetamol which gave relief to some extent Thereupon I searched quotPHNquot on internet and found capsaicin and on this website I asked for an additional prescription of capsaicin which I now apply times a day I feel back to normal and I too can say Got my life back
4337,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,10,41892,39,I applied two doses the first day I got it to my thumbs about eight hours apart Yes its true that its easy to get in your eyes nose or mouth and it burns Even after a shower I could still feel it on my skin I expected to have to reapply it each day But heres the funny part The pain in my hands is nowhere near as intense as it was even two days after that initial application Why Its welcomed but kinda weird
4338,Capsaicin,Pain,6,41791,39,Worked well the first time If you have severe burning like I had my second time milk applied provides instant relief
4340,Capsaicin,Pain,1,41584,43,I used this for knee pain per my doctor recommendation I read the instructions and applied the medication It didnt relieve my pain it caused more pain Severe burning stinging pain Even showering to wash the medication off was painful I had to use calamine lotion to counter the effects Perhaps my skin is more sensitive than others out there but I would use caution with this medication
4341,Capsaicin,Pain,9,41548,29,I began using CapsaicinHP for severe pain from by neck to top of my buttocks caused by fibromyalgia I found it to decrease my pain as much or better than nonnarcotic oral medications Then I had an injury to my back which required a lumbar spinal fusion at LS Capsaicin again helped my pain incredibly I applied everyday to times a day before surgery and then limited used to areas of neck and back away from incision until site healed then resumed use over entire back It does get very quothotquot at times but I learned not to focus on that and realized that was the time it seemed to be removing pain the best I am a nurse and eventually learned to allow it to quotheatquot which typically lasts about min and I got the best results
4344,Capsaicin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,8,41012,44,I have had PHN for years and have been in extreme pain My Internist told me about Zostrix HP along with the warning to be careful applying it and to wash it off my hands I started using latex gloves to administer it on my body and after weeks my pain began to subside I am now at a very manageable pain level On a with being the highest pain I am now finally at point five after years of being at a pain level of day and night I use it sparingly pea sized amount x a day I highly recommend it if you had shingles and then PHN
4346,Capsaicin,Pain,9,40887,19,I used Trixaicin HP for Thoracic Spine Damage to the nerve root at the C C level C root causing numbness in my index finger and thumb I used gloves and put the Trixaicin directly on the pain That caused the Trixaicin to heat up so much it burned Not unbearably but it did cause me to wonder if it heated up worse on the pain because that was the most painful spot
4347,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,40855,40,Im a year old female with moderate severe osteoarthritis of the hip and back I have been using Capsaicin gel for weeks and the pain has subsided tremendously Experienced burning sensation the first day only It has given me back parts of my reason for living
4348,Capsaicin,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1,40784,9,Side effects include allergic reaction rash hives itching pain in the middle of the chest tightness in the chest difficulty breathing or swallowing irritation redness blistering severepersistent burning at the application site
4349,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,40383,53,Im female and have had arthritis in my hands knees and feet over the past ten years Since using capsaicin over the last two years Ive found tremendous relief It burned when I first started using it but the burning quotwore offquot after a week and I find it totally painless to use I apply it in the morning as well as in the evening I learned to NOT use my fingers to apply it Instead I use the topside of my thumbs between the first and second joints from the tip of the thumb That way I dont accidentally get capsaicin in my eyes especially when applying my contact lenses an hour later I highly recommend capsaicin and suggest sticking with it even if at first it burns Its well worth trying
4350,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,6,40378,42,I prefer the initial pain of application than the pain in my spine hip and legs Be careful going out in the sun even the day after application some residual effects will be felt Wear latex or plastic gloves when applying and wash your hands after applying If you touch a part of your body that has capzasin on it be sure to rewash your hands and DO NOT touch your eyes without washing your hands
4351,Capsaicin,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1,40220,35,Tried it for foot pain diabetic neuropathy terrible results Pain increased had to wash it off Wash your hands very well after use even if you dont see the cream on your hands some residue may still exist and if you get it in your eyes it will really burn

4359,Gefitinib,Non-Small Cell Lung Cance,9,39964,90,My personal experience with Iressa has been very good The side effects of the drug were so much less than those of intravenous chemotherapy When I finished traditional chemotherapy in December I participated in the clinical trials I started taking Iressa in January My last scan after traditional chemotherapy showed that the cancer was still growing My next scan after taking Iressa for days showed marked improvement in my condition Each scan thereafter showed slow but detectable improvement It is now late May of and Im still taking Iressa and still showing signs of improvement The side effects while everpresent are far more tolerable than those of traditional chemotherapy

4387,Belviq,Obesity,5,42874,8,I will be starting belviq Sunday due to some of the comments saying make sure to start and stop when nothing is going on I have a big event Saturday but I am posting because of the price I went online printed the coupon filled out all the info etc before using the coupon it was out of pocket even with my insurance paying their part With the coupon at CVS and Cigna HMO I paid for mine So just FYI on the price Looking forward to this Phentermine worked the st year I took it and now it does nothing but spike my BP so Im hopeful this will help as I change my diet and exercise
4389,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42868,8,Been on it for several days and cant take it no more Horribly nauseous the scariest night terrors ever and head hurts so bad I thought I would pass out I really thought I could get through it and it would work I just cant take it So sad
4390,Belviq,Obesity,2,42867,5,Well I wrote my review see below too soon I had only taken it that day and did not go through a full hour period This medicine is hell I had horrible nightmares like Ive never had in my life then the headache came back like someone hit me with a x I was a COMPLETE ZOMBIE the next day The worse No Belviq you are doing it wrong
4391,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42867,38,Im years old exercise regularly and have not been able to loose any weight at all on my own in years and actually started gaining My Dr Prescribed Belviq Ive been on Belviq for days Ive lost pounds Amazing I have had no side effects whatsoever except that the first night I had terrible dreams so now I only take this drug once a day in the morning and its working I need to loose pounds and I weighed under when I started I walk miles times a week and I went to an calorie diet every day I am very strict on my calories Lots of fruit protein and veggies which I hate but the weight is coming off and Im very encouraged I will continue till Im at my goal weight
4392,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42867,25,I started taking belviq May My beginning weight was as of today beginning week two I weigh I have lost pounds I am on a calories a day I replaced a meal with a protein shake So for every thing is wonderful My first days on this medicine I was very tired and lower back pain All of those side affect has gone away I walk minutes every day I will be up dating weekly Good Luck everybody
4393,Belviq,Obesity,9,42865,3,First let me tell you if you go on belviqcom site and print coupon make sure you do all the steps You have to just call into an electronic response system not a live person For me that made a difference because I didnt want to talk to someone else about my weight Anyway Ill be honest Ive had this medicine for two months and today is the first day Ive taken any Ive taken weight loss medicine before years back of course not this kind and it changed me in a bad way So I finally tried this today and only had a very mild headache earlier and now its gone Its helped my appetite so far Im so glad I just wish I would not have waited these past two months to try it
4394,Belviq,Obesity,1,42865,4,I have been using Belviq for about two years I went from down to and then it just stopped helping me lose The price is so very high and even though I use a coupon and go to Walmart each month was a hassle with the pharmacist as to what discount if any I would be able to get I never heard of per month with a voucher I need to know where to get a voucher like THAT The last time I tried to use a company coupon Walmart told me that it was no longer valid Ive never gone back even thou I have a prescription While I was on it I noticed that my weight was no longer dropping even tho I was eating the same Without a coupon I wont be buying it any morebut where can I get a voucher and pay
4395,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42864,19,I started taking Belviq about weeks ago after my doctor recommended I lose weight I have to admit the first week I was starving while taking Belviq I also started the paleo diet and increased my water to oz a day most dayslol and min of activity days a week I lost lbs the first week I have continued to lose weight due to the combination of the low carb and the Belviq I do not feel it is suppressing my appetite but I believe it is assisting in my weight loss I seem to be burning more calories and I rarely have cravings I do have a one carb treat once a week to treat myself and then I get right back on track sometimes a girl wants chocolate or cheesecake or BOTH I am pleased with the results so far I feel better
4396,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42864,19,This is my third week on Belviq and Im happy to say I am down pounds My goal is to loss pounds the first month to justify spending another Looks like I will be able to purchase another months supply Got pounds to go
4398,Belviq,Weight Loss,2,42860,9,The whole point of Belviq is that it is supposed to suppress ones appetite Of course to really lose more weight everything you wrote factors in You missed the point with many reviewersBelviq is not suppressing their appetite like quotoh I have to make myself eatquot etc That said I have been on Belviq for days I take mg x a day I have not noticed a decrease in appetite at all Im still hungry in the am and pm Bummer No side effects either I started at lbs and just wishing my appetite would relax where I could say quotoh I have to make myself eatquotAlso I printed up the coupon from Belviqcom and paid instead of
4399,Belviq,Weight Loss,2,42860,5,I really eat healthy on a regular basis low carb kind of like the keto and atkins diet I lost around pounds on my own and was in a plateau phase My doctor suggested taking this medicine The first days major headaches but then they went away I am eating working out and doing my normal routine with this medicine Now I weight myself week later and learned I GAINED POUNDS Doesnt make any sense but I am going to stop taking it when I can loose that much myself without medicine Really sad but this is what I have to do
4400,Belviq,Weight Loss,6,42856,6,I tried this medication twice The first time I started at and lost to and then stopped however it helped me maintain the I am quot at y The first three days had severe headache but then like magic it went away My insurance wouldnt pay for the medication after months because I didnt lose any more weight I then tried again about months later my doctor recommended again and I started at and lost to and stopped losing I also this time began to feel very tired and depressed and realized after about three weeks that suicidial and depression are side effects so I had to stop taking it Now I am at my scales on doctors I am and this is all in approximately months
4401,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42856,22,Ive been steadily gaining weigh over the last couple years and even more since my hysterectomy My Pcp decided to try me on Belviq to assist me in losing some of the weight Id gained I started taking mg Belviq twice a day days ago My weight before starting was lbs As of day I am down to Ive always eaten pretty healthy foods and I really dont exercise much So Id say Belviq is definitely helping The only side effects Ive encountered were The st couple of days I had a very mild headache It made me feel a little sleepier but not too much I definitely sleep more sound at night which is always good My appetite has certainly decreased so I give myself smaller portions now Ill update more later
4402,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42853,7,I was on this drug for about weeks It did not curb my appetite In fact I was increasingly hungry and could not stop eating I gained pounds on it which Im assuming is not how this drug is supposed to work Once I stopped my appetite returned to normal however now I have pounds to lose in addition to the I initially wanted I am sure I was a unique case but I would caution that if you start gaining stop the drug I felt like I needed to stay on it because it was so expensive and I didnt want to waste my money And my doctor said to give it time Well pounds was enough time
4403,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42849,9,Nightmare from the beginning Day extreme nausea dizziness and headaches Day was worse and had bloody urine Stopped taking it
4404,Belviq,Weight Loss,3,42847,14,Beware Started this drug days ago along with diet and exercise I lost lbs in days My side effects were severe cough dizziness headache fatigue and flu like symptoms On day I didnt like how I was feeling I decided to stop taking it I didnt think it was worth waiting for those effects to go away even if they did My cough subsided quite a bit in such a short time Today day the start of my second day without the pill I awoke this morning sat on the bed and started to cough I started to gasp for a breath and there was no air Several minutes later I was wondering why my eyebrow and cheek along with my body hurt I opened my eyes and realized I blacked out and was lying face down on the wood floor Run
4405,Belviq,Obesity,6,42846,6,This is the first day on Belviq XR so I havent been able to notice much of a change in my eating lesser I didnt experience any headaches or nausea Actually had a little more energy Now Ive just did months on Phentermine mg and I went from lbs to lbswithout exercising much I wanted to continue the phentermine But my doctor said months is the limit He suggest I try Belviq since you can remind on Belviq longer I am and current weight is lbs My goal is too get down to lbs and I am very optimistic in reaching this goal
4406,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42845,27,I started on Belviq one week ago I have struggled with weight my entire life Im active and average steps a day and practice yoga once a week I love to cook and I love to eat of my meals are healthy but the other are not Over the years Im certain my portions of healthy food are more than I need and I binge on the junk food and drink beer After gaining pounds last year I tipped the scale at Im years old The first day I had a headache it went away within minutes I sleep great and Im not obsessed with food Ive stayed between calories easily and have lost pounds in one week Im eating healthy the binging is gone and I get full faster
4407,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42842,5,Started Belviq days ago I am incredibly drained and exhausted Have had headaches issues with balance feeling of not connecting to my own thoughts or words eating more gained pounds And today the exhaustion was so bad I feel asleep behind the wheel of my car twice on a short trip to my grandparents house I left a message with my doctors office and will follow up tomorrow Take the side effects seriously I have never had issues like this with a medication
4411,Perphenazine,Psychosis,1,42677,3,I had a very bad experience with perphenazine I ended up with severe joint pain difficulty breathing chest pain weird spinning sensation in my face on the right side of my nostril on my forehead and on the right side of my temporal area I had difficulty urinating and horrible insomnia It has been well over months since taking up to mg for only a few about days and I am still having problems I started on only mg back in Dec and took the same dosage up to Mar I stopped because I could barely urinate Then I started have weird movement as stated above in my face but not as bad as the movement when I took mg The I was told that I needed to start back on this drug for the movement to disappear
4412,Perphenazine,Psychosis,9,42669,2,Not that bad Daytime drowsiness
4413,Perphenazine,Psychosis,10,42661,0,Not bad Im taking other meds as well I recommend everyone gives it a chance before judging to harshly on this site
4417,Perphenazine,Psychosis,6,42346,8,My son has been hospitalized times in the past yearsThe doctors have prescribed a myriad of of concoctions over these years Ive seen my son go from a healthy teenager to a lb unhealthy sluggish overmedicated sad shell of a person When he was introduced to perphenazine he seemed to come back to life Butunfortunately as soon as we see real results he quits taking the pills and it all starts all over again How can I get my son to stick to taking his medicationAny suggestions
4418,Perphenazine,Bipolar Disorde,9,41753,13,Helped stop hallucinations
4419,Perphenazine,Bipolar Disorde,9,41480,18,Have been bipolar all my life and have major anger issues Since my doctor put me on perphenazine mg daily my issues have dramatically decreased but still flare up now and then The only side effect I found is the lethargy after taking it
4420,Perphenazine,Psychosis,8,41264,22,I have been on Trilafon perphenazine for about years Im on a low does mg x times a day From what I understand this medicine is a lot more gentle than most medicines that would treat bipolar schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis Its not good for elderly as the higher the dosage you get the more at risk you are for tardiv dyskinesia or tremors of the face arms and hands I am and this medicine worked when Lexapro Geodon Haldol and risperidone wouldnt I am given it for Pscyhsis In addition I am on mg Viibryd and mg of Klonopin I would recommend this medicine
4421,Perphenazine,Bipolar Disorde,5,41225,14,Keeps the crazies at bay mostly the delusions etc
4422,Perphenazine,Bipolar Disorde,6,40962,21,I was on a very high dose mgday for two years At first it was wonderful My Dr told me it was a mood stabilizer and for me it did just that For a while After a few months I started taking naps in the day HIGHLY abnormal to me Then after the naps I started to go to bed earlier and earlier Then one day I realized I was sleeping hours out of the day Since I followed my Drs intruction and we weaned my off my days are bright again No naps chores are getting done I am not neglecting my hygeine picking up forgotten hobbies living THRIVING And absolutely no withdrawl
4424,Perphenazine,Psychosis,9,40686,45,I had a similar experience Tremors in hands not really noticeable to someone watching unless they were looking for it but relief from the delusions I was experiencing My problem has been going on for over years so I anticipate it will not magically disappear and it didnt but the clarity of thinking I experience with this medicine really helps me
4425,Perphenazine,Bipolar Disorde,8,40640,16,This has been helpful with the anxiety and mood swings Doesnt seem to have as much as an antidepressant effect as Abilify did for me
4426,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42791,9,I took my first dose this morning I am a healthy yrs old but know that getting the weight off as I age will be better for me I look forward to posting positive results and to have them serve as my accountability And to read all your posts to serve as support and counting down

4430,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42782,43,After being recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism I began to take Belviq After about two weeks I started seeing results I have now been on the medication for four months and have lost pounds The only side Effect I have experienced is dry mouth
4431,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42782,22,My starting weight was Started taking Belviq first month was maybe lb loss then the lbs starting dropping To date I weight my goal is I also cut out all white food no fast food soda or candy I also do days at the gym Went from a mens suit to a regular mens The first week I did have a headache and dizzy
4432,Belviq,Weight Loss,7,42782,28,I have struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember I am I have taken every weight loss pill you can think of My starting weight today Feb is and Im Today is my first day on Belviq I take pill twice a day Side effects chills metal taste on my tongue and a slight headache When I ate lunch today I could only eat half of my food and Im not starving when I get off work like usual I must also mention that I am pmsing and usually Im eating every thing pasta and fried related but Im not craving it From reading the reviews I was worried about not having energy to workout but I had the energy What I have also done is I have starting B injections I will report my weight soon
4434,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42781,20,I started taking Belviq days ago and I am pounds lighter today Far as side affects I had just a tiny bit of light head amp I think that was only because I read some of the reviews amp thats what some people were saying they had amp it was stuck in my mind it was going to happen Other than that Ive been absolutely fine amp Im looking forward to more weight loss
4436,Belviq,Weight Loss,6,42774,12,Ive been on this just for a week now The first five days all I wanted to do was eat and I actually gained pound But the last two days my appetite has decreased and when I do eat I get full very fast so hopefully it stays like this Im not on any diet or exercise program which would probably help but if I go down to a calorie a day diet I wouldnt even need a pill Ill keep checking back in that to share my experience
4437,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42774,30,I started Belviq XR yesterday Took my first pill at am I realized at noon that I hadnt had my normal daily healthy snack and that I wasnt hungry for lunch I did eat lunch at but only a few bites and I lost all interest I felt a little dizzy later in the afternoon so I had some carrots and had to force my dinner down later and ate of it Never did I feel hungry all day I can see with this pill you have to force yourself to eat I had absolutely NO cravings yesterday for anything I did get cold later in the afternoon which Im NEVER cold And my skin got tingly like I put icyhot on it Other than that and a little lightheadedness I had no other side effects Will update again at the week mark

4439,Belviq,Obesity,9,42763,21,I am a year old woman with about pounds to lose If I want to get into a quotnormalquot weight range Have been taking mgs of Belviq x a day for the weeks The first day and a half my stomach was a bit unsettled And sometimes I feel a little fuzzy headed but not terribly so Now the only thing that I experience is sleeping longer than I usually do And this is not a bad thing but I sleep much better than I have for a long long time I feel like the medication is definitely taking the edge off of my hunger While I dont quotforget to eatquot I am certainly satisfied with eating much less Probably to as much And so far I have a lot more will power saying quotnoquot to things that I usually wouldnt pass by down
4440,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42761,32,I started this med before a weight loss program My problem was emotional eating Ive been taking it for a month I feel great I find the nervous eating has stopped My appetite has dropped tremendously Only side effect I am thirsty all the time which is okay anyway I drink lots more water From reading all the remarks about this drug its probably isnt for every one but so are some other drugs I cant take antibiotics I highly recommend this drug for weight loss Ive lost lbs
4441,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42759,43,I started taking Belviq and a half weeks ago and I have already lost pounds I know that sounds like an unhealthy amount in such a short time but I am sure to eat between calories a day I have just eliminated all processed foods and try to eat as much protein as possible I have always enjoyed lifting weights and going to the gym so I continue to do that days a week Now my appetite is under control with Belviq so I dont eat back all the calories I burned with exercise As far as side effects I did have a headache for the first two days It makes my body feel tired but not like a sleepy tired Im hoping that goes away soon but its not debilitating to the point I cant accomplish daily tasks
4442,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42759,32,Okay so it has now been days and I have lost pounds I have been making much better choices with my meal plans so this medication has worked better for me than phentermine On I weighed in at and In the past days I have experienced minor headaches and so ibuprofen mg took them away Dont forget to eat about an hour before you do a cardio or weight workout Yesterday I ate only one full meal of steak and rice at PM and drank a few protein drinks premier protein After working out I tanned for min then I went to the steam room for min and min in the sauna After that I felt so nauseous that anything I could think of to eat made me want to throw up but this medicine really works
4447,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42748,11,I do not recommend this medication to anyone A couple of days after my first dose I came down with severe symptoms nausea vomiting and chest palpitations Made a visit to the local ER After multiple test I was diagnosed with a virus Since it was during the Christmas holidays I associated it with quotholiday foodsquot Has taken a few weeks to get back to So on Monday I took my second dose of Belviq and on Tuesday the same symptoms occurred Andtoday is Friday Stay away

4456,Belviq,Weight Loss,5,42621,10,I started Belviq after coming off of Phentermine and I have also had gastric sleeve weight loss surgery Months ago The first days I was so exhausted and chilled I couldnt hardly move It has helped decrease hunger and I eat less now but havent lost any wt still maintaining a lbs weight loss but need to lose more But last night I noticed I was producing milk I have now read up that can be a side effect I go to my gyn tomorrow and will know more but Im pretty freaked out
4457,Belviq,Weight Loss,7,42620,7,Im rating for now Ill post again when Ive been on Belviq for weeks The first days I had headaches almost all day long After the third day the headaches stopped Ive noticed that I have more body aches than usual and my energy is a lot less I think these will level out My weight when I started was After days I am at I was on vacation of those days so I cheated a bit I believe I would have lost more if I would have been at home Its hard to diet when you are on vacation Im just happy that I lost at all Belviq does curb my appetite some Mostly I dont eat as much when I eat and I feel full longer Yesterday I forgot to eat lunch I have low sugar and not supposed to skip meals I am on a daily

4459,Belviq,Obesity,8,42617,23,So far so good I have been taking Belviq for week now first days had a terrible headach so I took my belviq with ibprophen ech time to avoid the headache it was terrible lastnight and this morning took just the belviq no headaches so no extra med I still have kinda a medicated feel in my brain but that happens to me with any new med i take i figure that to will pass Other than that no side effects First days didnt effect my appetite at all but I still ate calories From rd day on i have had to make myself eat literally I am yrs old quot tall and weigh lbs The highest I have ever been So im gonna give it an honest try through in some zumba and richard simmons videos and will report back Good luck everyone
4460,Belviq,Obesity,10,42615,15,BELVIQ is awesome I recommend it to anyone who wants to loose weight and keep it off But try really hard to document the side effects and tell your doctor about them I was on it for a few months and had lost a lot of weight I felt really good But it started to make my Attention Deficit Disorder symptoms a lot worse it just got to the point where I started loosing things and forgetting a lot so I stopped taking it and surely was not able to keep weight off without it So now I am going back to it this time I will be working closer with my doctor and we will focus on finding the correct maintenance dosing to help me maintain healthy body weight Also I recommend taking a Prolactin Blocker to help avoid tumors
4461,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42614,37,weeks in on Belviq and I have lost pounds following a calorie diet All the side effects are gone and I have so much more energy now Good luck to everyone

4474,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42579,39,I have been on Belviq for days now and have lost pounds I am using the Losing It app to log my food and track my calories which makes it so easy My goal is calories a day but sometimes I just cant work them all in The first couple of days I did have a small nagging headache but I am use to dealing with migraines so it wasnt a big deal The first week there was some tiredness but that seems to leaving me now and I seem to be getting more energy back The discount card is a plus since it only cost a month to fill I am happy with the results so far and look forward to feeling better without the weight
4476,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42739,67,I have been on Belviq for about years I initially started taking it to lose weight before my wedding last year From the time I began taking Belviq August I started feeling results although slow within about a month I had several fittings and such before the big day and the seamstress had to keep taking my dress in I had lost about lbs in ~ months I was amazedSo here we are two months after my wedding anniversary and I am currently down ~lbs I started at about and the last time I weighed myself I was at I have gone from a size to a size I would still like to lose another ~ lbs and I have no doubt Ill get there with Belviq
4478,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42712,11,The first few days I had crushing migraines and dizziness I began getting headaches around week again but didnt associate it with the meds because weeks passed with no side effects Then my left eye began to droop and blur my vision I thought it was due to botox The eye drooped to almost closed then my cheek fell and a few days later I had trouble speaking Rushed to the ER and got an MRI CT etc to rule out a stroke ZERO findings They said Botox was the cause My symptoms have come and gone which would not be botox reaction Today my vision is blurred to the point that I cant drive and eye barely open I just figured out that the eye opens when I miss a dose NOT WORTH IT My hospital bill is going to be HUGE
4483,Belviq,Obesity,10,42675,71,I started as a size weighing pounds on May th As of right now November st I weigh and am wearing a size I take Belviq twice a day walk for at least min per day as I walk the dogs and I use Lose It to track my foods so that I am aware of what I eat Even if I go over my recommended daily caloric intake at least I know where I stand This has worked perfectly for me and my weight loss Ive been very successful The only thing that changed for me was adding in Belviq I was already doing the rest for at least a year prior avg was unsuccessful So I credit Belviq for my success
4486,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42667,46,Im a year old female I was overweight by lbs I know thats not a lot but I was afraid of gaining even more weight I was hungry all the time I would eat a big meal at lunch and feel like I was starving an hour later My doctor prescribed me Belviq weeks ago Ive lost lbs so far I use my Gear fit to track my steps and water intake Im also using the S health app on my phone to track my calories I eat no more then calories per day I only drink water No alcohol no soda no coffee The first day I took Belviq I did have a headache and I felt dizzy By the next day I felt normal again I went on the Belviq website to download their coupon I do not go through my insurance I pay per month Well worth it
4487,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42662,26,I have been on Belviq for month The first day I was extremely tired and weak No other symptoms I have lost lbs this month I take mg belviq x a day have been taking mg of phentermine in the middle of the day last few weeks Prior to this i was on phentermine mg twice a day and was able to lose and keep off about lbs You still have to work at it to lose weight with this drug it just makes things a little easier Within the first few days I could tell I was eating smaller portions and getting full fast I have pounds to lose to get to my goal weight so my weight loss is slower than someone with more to lose Usually I will lose per month so I am very happy with lbs It is expensive but its worth a try
4488,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42661,21,After two weeks use of the medication I had three seizures in less than two hours and had to go to ER I have never had seizures in my life It was the scariest moment of my life
4489,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42661,45,I weighed about years ago Had tried phenfen and just about every type of diet imaginable I was when I started Im now at and while I could lose another im not because my skin is so droopy due to years of losinggaining hundreds of pounds note to young womenyou dont want this too happen to you and im too old to have skin surgery Losing weight was so easy with Belviqfeel full no cravings and just eat less

4532,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42403,42,Ive been taking belviq for six months Ive lost pounds At I went from to Id like to loose that last I combined Belviq with the Calorie counting app that allows you to enter daily foods and activities It then provides a daily analysis and maintains all your records Finally it grades you each day Together Ive had great success and feel so much better Only side effect dry mouth I can live with that

4537,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42388,32,Ive been taking Belviq for months and have lost lbs but I am also exercising by walking at least days a week and watching what I eat I have had no side affects I feel for Belviq to work as you want and as efficiently as it can you need to have not only exercise but the frame of mind to think things through when you are feeling hungry Like why are you hungry are you not hungry but bored are you sitting around watching TV I have eaten most anything I want but in portions I have learned after months the amount of food that I know will fill me up so I dont get the feeling of full like I did in the beginning because I dont put large portions on my plate and Im never hungry after a meal

4543,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42378,24,I have been on Belviq for days now and I was worried that I might not see any weight loss I have joined the gym at work and I work out days a week After reading some of the positive responds I am very hopeful that I will lose weight I hope that I have a successful story as above and not a story that I can not lose anything Just for the record I feel great taken pills a day and I have not had any headaches at all I hope that it stays this way
4544,Belviq,Obesity,5,42375,12,I am giving this a for now since its only been day I reached out to my dr for help with weight loss because I quit taking my Adderall in March of I was a size Maybe lbs Im yrs old and do not have a family history of obesity but once I got off the Adderall thats when my weight got out of control I went to a size and now weigh lbs So yesterday the Belviq didnt work much I was SO tired All I did was stay in bed I took my first dose around am I took my nd dose at pm I ate go gurts hotdogs and a plate of spaghetti Then I fell asleep because it made me SO sleepy I didnt wake up til pm today today was better Less appetite still tired but less appetite
4545,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42373,69,I have been on Belviq months and I have lost pds I have dropped down to pill now because I do not want to get addicted to them I did not give stars because I want to make sure I do not get any long term side effects first But Thanks Belviq I went from to and I feel so much better I wish it was cheaper though
4549,Belviq,Weight Loss,6,42358,30,I started days ago The first days I had dizziness and serious hunger pangs I felt like I was more hungry than ever The side affects are lesseningbut not gone Sadly despite diet and exercise I have not lost pound Ill see how things go for a full weeks before stopping
4550,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42358,21,weeks into Belviq and while I dont have the dreaded headache I have not lost any weight at all despite of dropping from meals a day to and giving up soda diet or regular I feel fine sleep well but weight exactly the same as I did before I started
4551,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42462,24,I started taking Belviq March It has been just about a week now I would suggest that you go with the day free trial before you consider purchasing this product It hasnt worked for me at all in fact I almost feel like Im taking a placebo I havent noticed any change in my appetite other than being just as hungry or hungrier Im not really sure how its supposed to work I just know that isnt working I purchased the day supply so Im going to keep taking it until I finished all of the medication but I doubt very seriously that Ill be reordering Maybe by some miracle something will happen after or weeks Im very disappointed because I really want to lose weight and I dont want to have surgery
4552,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42460,23,I have been on belviq for a month now no change in appetite at all amp I have gained weight I am tired all the time amp get awful headaches How can I exercise amp eat right if I am so tired I cant get out of bed So far a big waste of money
4555,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42458,12,I had the same appetite and weight that I had when I didnt use belviq It is expensive and it didnt work at all for me I was still hungry just like before I dont recommend it
4558,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42443,75,Lost pounds in about months and its still coming off No side effects Im ecstatic Note it took a little over a month before I saw results Two pills a day I suggest minutes prior to meals Get full blood work and cardio first blood rechecks quarterly I now feel much fuller with smaller portions Folks diet is probably of weight loss Choose a small subset of low cal filling foods and stick with those Rotate when burned out Egg whites poultry are a staple for me Eliminate all breads and sugar Drink water On the fence Remember obesity kills Use quotmyfitnesspalquot app or similar and record everything that goes into your mouth Bottom line for me Im less of a man than I was months ago and Im happy about that
4559,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42441,34,I am on my third day of Belviq It seems to be working for suppressing my appetite I read a lot of reviews before taking it and I have noticed some of the common side effects not sure if its just because I read it that Im thinking Im feeling it I have had some dizziness super thirsty some heat flashes tired But I do like the fact that it suppresses my appetite Ive been eating healthier and working out a lot so I will weigh in two weeks My start date was at lbs
4561,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42437,33,I have been on Belviq for month and love itThe first week was hard because I was put of it had muscle aches and just didnt feel rightAfter week I felt great and now I have lost lbs which probably isnt healthy but I had to force myself to eatI noticed when I am hungry I am going to healthy foods rather than junk
4563,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42434,55,My dr gave me the choice of two different weight loss medicines After reading the reviews for both of them I was a little worried about taking either But after much research I decided on belviq I started and as of today I have lost lbs I have a lot more to lose but I am very pleased with my results and how effective belviq works I have had absolutely NO side effects at all Along with taking the medicine I use the ap my fitness pal to track my calorie intake This ap is awesome and I highly recommended it I workout usually days a week I have a bad knee so I am only able to do cardio on an elliptical for about mins and then I lift for about mins So I am exercising but not more then a hour each night
4565,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42430,24,I just started belviq on Friday Feb side effects are headache and hour after I take it in mornings and tiredness throughout most of the day hopefully this subsides but I do feel as my hunger is being suppressed I have to force myself to eat but healthy Im going to keep at it a month and reevaluate when script is due I will weigh myself in weeks to see whats happening without coupon next time I will have my doctor prescribe then the coupon will cover I will keep u updated
4566,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42427,33,I started Belviq on today I am down pounds I started at lbs and today I weigh lbs it works but you have to work too No side effects for me My goal is lbs by May stthats only lbs
4567,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42427,15,Even though I did lose about pounds in almost weeks I feel that was from my healthy eating and not the belviq I was still hungry extremely tired and towards the end of my trial depressed I wouldnt reccomend this product to anyone
4568,Belviq,Weight Loss,2,42425,12,This drug made me extremely tired and then the heartburn started after three weeks and I could not take any longer Zero pounds lost in three weeks
4569,Belviq,Obesity,6,42423,21,So I have mixed feelings about this drugPros Helped me not crave sugar bread and carbs I lost pounds on it Helped me stay motivated at the gym by being able to stick to my meal plans Cons If you take it you need to be committed For some odd reason I and a lot of people have experienced it when you get off it then try to retake it again it doesnt seem to work STAY ON IT I didnt get side effects from this med maybe occasional anxiety and a headache Drinking on this med will give you the worst hangovers Also noticed sometimes it stalled my weight loss even when I was counting my intake Overall I probably wont take this drug again until there is more thorough long term research done on it
4570,Belviq,Weight Loss,5,42422,16,I started Belviq with the free day prescription After the days I had only lost pounds I decided to get the day prescription since it was only with the Belviq savings card I think I will try it for a month or two to see how it goes I havent really experienced any side affects other than my blood sugar being way lower than normal which is a good thing although Im not really sure why as I feel I am eating as much as before Some days it seems I get fuller quicker than normal when eating but I still get as hungry as I ever did before I will be getting back to more regular exercise soon so I hope that will help too I only gave it a quotquot for now until I see how it goes Fingers crossed
4573,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42416,31,First days of taking Belviq no difference except generalized muscle aches Then the switch came on Weight started falling off Did not change lifestyle all I didnt excercise amp didnt start Lost lbs in approx months Kept wt off yr After yr Belviq seems to have stopped working Have put lbs back on Has it stopped working after months for anyone else Loved it amp want it to work again for me
4575,Belviq,Obesity,9,42413,39,Ive been on Belviq for months and have lost lbs I eat what I want but I eat so much less of it now At Thanksgiving and Christmas I could barely finish the small portions on my plate My only side effect has been dry mouth so I drink more water Win Win My only concern is what will happen when I eventually go off the medicine
4576,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42572,45,Ive been taking Belviq for two years Slowly I lost pounds I have continued to take this medication and the most important detail is that I have kept my weight loss off as Belviq Works perfectly for weight maintenance too I cant tell you how many times prior to Belviq that Id gained and lost this weight Very much helps me with cravings and over eating
4577,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42571,13,I was kind of scared to use Belviq because of all the other reviews but I took the Belviq for two weeks did not feel anything I felt a little dizzy and had dry mouth but other than that I did not have any other side effects did not loose any weight did not curb my appetite at all I paid a lot of money and it did not do me any justice
4578,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42569,39,Ive been using Belviq for days now and I will admit I was afraid to start using Belviq because of the reviews I have read Especially being a single parent with a year old I wondered if this would be more stressful or if it would help I do have slight issues with headaches but its not unbearable and taking tylenol takes the edge off Ive experienced both bursts of energy and a little drowsiness again nothing thats not bearable Overall I would say I like using Belviq The fact of taking the medication makes you more aware of what needs to be done in order to be fit but it really does curb the appetite I take it with food and so far Ive lost about a pound a day
4579,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42557,60,Prescribed Belviq about three months ago April mg twice a day Went to the doctor two months later and had lost lbs from to Again I went two weeks later and I was down to Had some side effects such as fatigued dry mouth but just drink more water Does a great job of curbing my appetitemaking me feel full on less food Also seemed to change my taste buds Doesnt at all agree with Alcohol This is the first drug that has helped me lose weight This is important since I am on estrogen blockers due to Breast Cancer and had a hard time losing weight Will continue on this medicine
4580,Belviq,Obesity,2,42556,15,Ive been on Belviq for weeks now I wanted so much for this to work so I endured the dizziness extreme fatigue foggy brain memory problems and even an increase in my irregular heart beat hoping they would decrease and the Belviq would work They did not and Ive experienced no improvement in appetite control The worst part is Ive been treated for clinical depression and had to go off the meds that had been helping me in order to take Belviq The antidepressant effects of Belviq never kicked in for me and Ive been miserable Im glad it helps some people but I wanted to write this review for people who are being treated for depression before trying the Belviq Precede cautiously It may not be for you
4581,Belviq,Obesity,3,42553,15,I was prescribed Belviq because I have multiple health issues rooted in obesity The first couple weeks were dramatic lost about ten pounds which I presume must have been water weight as it does eliminate excess sugar through urine excretion I was still drinking adequate water quartsday to stay hydrated but night time leg cramps interrupted my sleep up to x per night Also was eating less but weight loss plateaued after the first month Another side effect that forced me to stop Belviq was the brain fog after taking a couple weeks I could not complete a thought much less stay organized like I needed to be for work I was also pretty tired most of the time Not worth it
4582,Belviq,Obesity,10,42551,39,I think belviq pretty much saved my life I had always been overweight all my life from about years old As an adult I had always maintained a weight of around lbs However at I was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis and had to have a complete hysterectomy gall bladder and appendix removal I soon began gaining approximately pounds a month post surgery and was soon at at my highest My doctor prescribed belviq on December th The first week I lost lbs and by mid January I had lost lbs Now in June I weigh lbs and feel fabulous It wasnt a quick fix but it worked and I stopped taking it in February and have maintained my weight I recommend belviq to anyone ready to commit to a lifestyle change
4583,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42547,31,Ive been on Below for weeks now and the only side effects Ive noticed have been a slight back ache and dry mouth But I have lost lbs so far so its been worth it It definitely curbs my appetite but I always eat small healthy meals I hope it keeps going this way for me
4585,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42543,19,Took first pill yesterday Noticed almost immediately no appetite Got a hummus wrap for lunch amp couldnt even eat half of it I can usually eat the whole thing Dinner I ate the other half then took nd pill Now as I write this almost hours later after that nd pill I wish I had never taken it amp wont take it again Last night chills My arm tingled all night long amp thought it was signaling a heart attack That thought caused me a lot of anxiety amp I could not sleep well Got up twice during the night to go to the bathroom amp had to hold the wall all the way there as my legs and back were in severe muscle pain This morning had a hard time dragging myself out of bed Most meds seem to react fully on me I cannot take Belviq
4587,Belviq,Weight Loss,7,42537,39,I started taking Belviq two weeks ago At first I only took one pill a day but on week two I moved to two pills a day as prescribed Ive lost lbs in two weeks by taking the pill as directed twice a day and maintaining my calorie intake or below Ive also made sure Im drinking at least oz of water each day and have cut out sodas throughout the week I have faith that Ill reach my Weightloss goal
4589,Belviq,Weight Loss,3,42536,16,Day on Belviq Cravings havent subsided nor do I feel like my brain is signaling me that Im full or that I do not need that Reeses in line at the market for the ride home My main concern is the tiredness the lethargy and listlessness It is horrible I want to stop taking it but have read to quothang in therequot Oh mercy Im trying but its so hard My husband can notice the difference My sexual appetite is gone heck maybe its bc Im too tired In any case I will continue for several more days as I hear this will go away but its so very hard I am hoping that my cravings for sweets will subside as well Will update
4590,Belviq,Weight Loss,5,42534,15,Thank you to those of you that mentioned that Belviq takes more than a few days to reach peak performance I guess when you think about it since it works on serotonin most medications like that take a couple of weeks to start really working I was on it days and was still craving things and was mad I noticed today when I got up that I was not wanting to eat until like pmIf you can say anymore about that it would be helpful thanks
4594,Belviq,Obesity,9,42526,24,I started Belviq on Thursday evening before dinner and today is Sunday morning I weighed in at on Thursday and this morning was I felt the affects instantly I was shocked how sick I felt after trying to eat a regular size serving Ive had almost half the usual amount of food at EVERY single meal since I started And almost zero between meal snacks I did have about fresh cherries yesterday but thats been the only snack No side effects maybe a little dry mouth Im not expecting to continue seeing this level of weight loss continue but Im so optimistic about my future now I love how tiny the pills are and I got a certificate from the Belviq website that makes it possible for me to only pay Its worth it
4598,Belviq,Obesity,3,42523,12,i started belviq one week ago i got on the scale im lbs up my legs have been swollen since yesterdayi feel dizzy and fatigue taking itive been eating less and exercising at least times in the past weeki dont think this pill is for meim feeling uncomfortable with swollen legs its scaryi will call my physician tomorrow to see what i can do for this to go awaybut i wont take another pill after this
4600,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42515,24,So far it is working very well It is curbing my desire to reach for more than one portion at a time It is allowing me to eat less and think twice about what I am consuming The fatigue is present but you have to consider the drop in food intake and the medication I am doing the atkins diet taking supplements and exercising when I am able too Headaches disappeared after the first day Definitely worth it for me Print out the coupon it will help to offset the expense of the medication
4602,Belviq,Weight Loss,2,42279,16,Ive been on Belviq for five days The first day was hard I was dizzy hot and had a headache all day But Ive been good since then with only slight dizziness Yesterday I started taking pills and I havent noticed any difference I still feel hungry all the time Will it work better if I take it on an empty stomach I dont think its worth it so far
4604,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42276,50,I have been taking for four months now and have lost pounds My doctor also prescribed mg of Phentremine taken in the morning I am veteran dieter and what I find out different about this drug is the lack of cravings Usually I start craving after a couple weeks Ice Cream French bread carbs It does curb the hunger but if you have patterned yourself with eating every meal or emotional eating it might not be for you If you are serious about loosing weight and need a little help it could be for you I eat one good meal a day Dinner And I mean a real meal Steak Chicken just not alot of carbs
4605,Belviq,Obesity,2,42275,23,I started using Belviq last December From December to March I lost lbs I am still on it but it has no more effects It wore off after months Although I am still losing slowly on my own
4606,Belviq,Obesity,1,42268,13,I have been taking Belviq for year next month and I have not lost any weight disappointed
4607,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42266,35,I have been on Belviq for days now and havent had any successI didnt need a weight loss pill until my doc prescribed me Zoloft and I gained lbs in two months I looked and felt extremely bloated after being on zoloft so my doc prescribed BelviqThe first week I had horrible headaches but the cravings were still thereAfter the first daysI called my doc about feeling bloatedShe prescribed me a water pillMeanwhile I had NO weight loss on Belviq after the daysAfter taking the water pill I lost lbs of water weightI went back to the doc and she said that I had lost lbs on Belviq and I needed to continue taking itIts my th day on BelviqIve gained weight and still have cravingsGlad it worked for some people
4608,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42265,64,I have been on belviq for a month now I have lost a total of lbs with no side effects other than dry mouth And I look at that as a good thing because that only forces me to drink more water I have never been a big water drinker or drinker of anything for that matter I truly believe my weight loss would be greater if it werent for my job I work a on off schedule in the oilfield I sit behind a computer for hours a day I tend to lose very little weight while at work because I dont move a whole lot During my days at home it drops quite fast because I dont stop I find belviq gives me the drive to move I also dont have much of an appetite on it And when I do eat I am eating half of what I used to eat
4609,Belviq,Obesity,10,42264,31,Im extremley over weight with many many health issues so my doctor put me on belviq a couple of days ago mg xday so far it is going well I noticed Im no longer craving sweets like I was Here it is late night and have absolutely no desire to eat or snack I used to be hungry all the timethis medicine seems to be working also my insurance did not cover it so my doctor just sent in an override so my cost was Im also in the month process of getting approved for gastric bypass surgery so looking foward to seeing how much weight comes off in a month
4610,Belviq,Obesity,8,42261,36,I have been on Belviq for about a week I must say I got sick right away and felt awful for about days It was a combination of getting a coldcough and taking the Belviq I believe The side affects have been gone for two days and I feel great Food doesnt even look that good and when I do eat something it is very easy to eat half or a third of what I normally would Like others have said willpower in a bottle I will update in a few months
4611,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42260,53,Ive been on Belviq for months including weeks of travel surrounded by very yummy foods and Ive lost pounds This is NOT a quick fix You still need to monitor your calorie intake and you still need to exercise Id been around pounds for the last years and even with lots of regular exercise I was never able to lose weight For me Belviq just gives me the ability to pause and think about what Im eating Its not going to eliminate the desire for a cupcake if its sitting right in front of you but it will make it easier to walk away Ill stay on it for a while and see if I can lose another pounds Good luck
4612,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42258,37,I started this weeks ago havent seen much weight loss yet but I feel full all of the time looking at food makes me nauseous I have noticed my blood sugar has decreased dramatically I may have to come off some of my diabetic Meds which is a plus Im giving my body time to loose the weight gradual weight loss is the best anyway
4613,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42250,46,Ive been on Belviq for about weeks and am down lbs This really works I still feel tired most of the time and have dry mouth but the other side effects lethargy back ache etc were mostly gone after the first week and now have completely disappeared Ive been overweight most of my life amp have tried many diets and herbals with no weight loss This is really working for me The only down side is the cost my insurance doesnt cover it I downloaded the savings card from the website so my cost is a month and feeling tired most of the time
4614,Belviq,Weight Loss,5,42249,40,So far my experience has been temperamental The first few days and over whelming quotfullquot feeling And then as the days went on the feelings went away I did a small process of elimination and realized I had a lesser full feeling when I took Belviq with my other medications and when I took it and ate later So now I have begun to take it an hour after I take my normal meds and I take it with food its nice to feel full again just my little cents
4616,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42238,149,I started taking Belviq in September of so I am about three weeks shy of a full year For the first two weeks I lost perhaps one pound and was getting discouraged so I simply tried harder By the way I was three hundred pounds on the dot when I started I now weigh Yep pounds in less than a year and I have reclaimed my life my energy my looks my sex drive and my optimistic outlook on life DO NOT expect it to work on the front end by which I mean it is NOT an appetite suppressant But and this is a huge but if you cut your caloric intake in half you will not experience hunger cravings afterword That is the keyEAT LESS Belviq will take care of the rest By the way I lost this weight without exercise
4617,Belviq,Obesity,7,42237,42,I have been on Belviq for week and day Day was just awful I felt quotstonedquot dizzy brain fog tight chest extremely tired The positive virtually instantaneous appetite suppression and more than that a feeling of satisfaction after eating only a fraction of what I normally ate So I decided to play out the side effects and see if they went away Each day was a little better than the last By day I was feeling mostly normal more like a benedryl fog than a stoned feeling now Other side effects were a mild cough some earjaw pain sneezing fits and general weirdness It is mostly gone now and I am down lbs Glad I stuck with it I am in it for the long haul I desperately want to be one of those before and after people
4618,Belviq,Obesity,5,42237,18,I am rating this drug a at this point because it has neither been a good experience nor a bad one Today is the day mark for me My weight has not budged since day one but its only a week in Im drinking a LOT more water and trying to make wise meal choices I seem to get full with less food than before I started Belviq but I am hungry most of the time I am also on the brink of falling asleep all day long I cant seem to really wake up truly until about in the afternoon Im up at during the week I am hopeful based on what Ive read online about the drug but so far for me personally no suppression of appetite substantial reduction in energy level and no weight loss O
4621,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42236,54,I started taking Belviq on July th After the first days free trial period I lost lbs Before Belviq I ate healthy foods but I felt hungry all the time and wound up snacking at night and even after a heavy dinner Now I get full right away halfway through my meal and I dont snack at night any longer To date Ive lost lbs and counting I had minor side effects mostly tiredness Been taking vitamin supplement and my tiredness has taper down LOVE THIS PRODUCT
4623,Belviq,Weight Loss,6,42233,30,I started Belviq midMay at about lbs and in the first month lost pounds eating calories per day depending on the day In the second month I lost again eating a similar diet In the last month I have lost another same thing Although this is good progress Im not sure it is worth the cost to continue In the beginning there was some feeling of fullness more quickly when eating but that has diminished over time Im considering going off of it soon because Id like to get pregnant Also at the month mark Im right at the recommended loss Overall I dont feel like the drug is good or bad I think it really depends on the individual
4625,Belviq,Obesity,2,42231,8,It didnt help me at all I craved chocolate all the time Not worth the a month
4626,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42230,34,I did great lost lbs in one week Second week lbs I lost lbs in three weeks Had knee replacement surgery and now I am having a difficult time getting back on track
4627,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42228,39,I have been using for almost month using only one dose a day instead of two and have lost pds so far with only minimal exercise I have had dry mouth at times and notice I cry more often when exposed to a sad situation Overall I am very pleased with the decrease in appetite and weight loss I am praying that I do not experience any major side effectsI still need to loose another to pds
4628,Belviq,Obesity,8,42228,50,So this Sunday will make exactly one month since I started Belviq and I need to reup on my script This is the Gods honest truth I started at pounds the first week I was too tired to exercise but I tried maybe days that week The nd week was much better the tiredness was gone and I got over the headaches so I was able to work out that entire week Nothing hard core just walking at a steady pace the rd week I didnt do bad during the week however I stopped working out My weight hit a plateau and I was pissed so I started working out again IM PROUND TO ANNOUNCE THAT I HAVE LOST A TOTAL OF POUNDS IN ONE MONTH This medication requires not just eating better but exercise

4758,Belviq,Obesity,5,42167,19,I started taking the Belviq about weeks ago and Im already down pounds The bad part is I have the painful urination frequent urge to go back pain increased headaches I have gone to specialist about my quotbladder issuequot and they have confirmed that this medication is the cause It sucks because its effective but I cant take the irritation
4759,Belviq,Obesity,6,42166,12,I have just ended my month on adipex I lost a total of lbs and now starting my six months on belviq My starting weight was in March of and now I currently weiGH I have read that many used belviq and have lost weight and some havent so I guess I just have to wait and see how it works for me I do work out now and eat healthy my biggest fear is gaining the weight back while isbeing off adipex My question is did anyone start adipex and then go on belviq If so what was your experience Will update monthly after my weigh ins
4760,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42165,65,After many years of unsuccessful weight loss my doctor suggested trying Belviq I cannot even express how wonderful my experience has been with it I have been taking it for close to two months and am down over lbs I also watch what I eat and exercise daily This is not a magic pill that will make you lose weight my experience with it is that it is a very effective tool that goes hand in hand with lifestyle changes I find that it makes eating right somewhat easy It seems to work in my brain changing my relationship with food For the first time in my life I am free from obsessive thoughts about food I felt a bit wonky the first day or two on it but at this point I have zero side effects
4761,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42163,60,I have been on Belviq for almost a month I am down lbs I am yr old Mother of two starting weight Now at I also had to take a week off of pills because I couldnt afford to get refill after the free trial I can not say enough positive things about this medication I have barely any appetite and when I do eat its about a quarter of the serving size I havent had any side effects and am exited to continue this weight loss journey My goal is to get down to lbs and as long as this medication continues to curb my appetite this much I know Ill be able to reach my goal I would say without hesitation that Belviq is a non surgical equivalent to gastric bypass surgery
4762,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42161,19,Ok So my rating has is based on nothing yet but just wanted to reassure new users because there is a lot of talk about the negative side effects day on belviqno headache I feel just fine aside from being slightly tires Cant wait to see if it works
4764,Belviq,Weight Loss,4,42156,46,WARNING Be prepared for withdrawal symptoms when you stop Belviq I tried Belviq months ago but got nervous about the initial headaches and stopped after weeks I had evenings of quotpalpitationsquot and one horrible anxiety filled night with desperate thoughts I got through it and rationalized starting again months later when I realized Belviq really did a good job of preventing quotcravingsquot and my tendency toward night eating After weeks and quotfairquot weight loss I decided the recent cognitive and vision side effects were not worth risk of continuing Withdrawal day tonight I should be on episode of Celebrity Rehabhorrific thoughts anxiety insomnia want to peel my skin off BRUTALhoping this is the worst of it Good luck

4780,Belviq,Obesity,10,42032,85,I began taking Belviq September and when I saw my doctor January had lost pounds The reason Belviq doesnt work for some people is because they are looking for something like the amphetamine diet pills from the s and s that boosted metabolism and totally killed the appetite What Belviq does is help people stick to a sensible diet ie it will keep you from being overly hungry and quotpigging outquot after eating a sensible dinner I take Belviq around oclock in the afternoon and Metformin mg after dinner
4781,Belviq,Obesity,10,42031,107,I have been on Belviq since September and have lost about lbs Today I weigh lbs and back in September I was at lbs I love Belviq so much its one of the best prescriptions I have ever gotten Because Belviq helps me control my appetite I am able to eat less and I eat healthier food also I have started working out for an hour a day days a week since I started Belviq Its the most amazing medication that exists it really has changed my life for the better
4782,Belviq,Obesity,10,42030,50,I have been taking this medicine for weeks now and have gone from pounds to Thats a huge deal for me because I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and typically cannot lose weight It suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat I have had no side effects at all and havent increased my exercise I am very happy with Belviq Hopefully it continues to go well
4783,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42030,157,Ive only taken Belviq for days but have had wonderful results already Ive lost lbs My doctor started me out slowly taking it only in the mornings for the first days just to ensure my body could tolerate it Tonight I will also begin to take it in the evenings I have had a bit of a dry mouth but I dont mind I just need to drink more water I did stop drinking soda and cut back on some of my calories Tomorrow I start at my gym so it will be interesting to see if I lose more weight or gain muscle I dont usually tolerate meds very well so Im really happy that this seems to be working for me so far Ill post another update as I get further along My insurance doesnt cover weightloss medicine but the discount card helps

4789,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42024,27,I thought at first this was not working but I realized it was working but had to pay more attention to my body I still get hungry but not as often or as quickly after meals so I would eat a healthy snack or meal It helps me eat smaller portions and I now feel satisfied faster but you must pay attention to your hunger and stop eating when you no longer feel hungry or you will overeat which makes me feel sick A couple times of that and you will learn Slow but steady weight loss about lb a week Side effects went away after weeks

4803,Belviq,Weight Loss,6,42074,1,I gave Belviq a rating because my weight has been fluctuating between it was usually towards the higher end Recently my Doc put me on Metformin as well because my blood sugar is slightly out of the normal range After I started the Metformin my weight has remained in the low end of that range I will say that after starting the week trial im almost at the end my portions are getting smaller and I do feel fuller faster Cravings are still there but it is getting easier to deal with I try to stick to sugar free portion controlled desserts like pudding I dont expect to get mind blowing results on a two week trial so Im willing to get a day supply and see how things go I hope I can get over the hump

4954,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,42746,4,I was perscribed lutera and when i went to the pharmacy they gave me orsythia instead because it was more affordable for me yet an equivalent of lutera As of recently I have been experiencing a lot more headaches and migraines which my doctor warned me about since I have family and personal history of severe migraines I havent gained any weight my periods are very light and about days long They start on the third inactive pill In addition my breasts have increased in size but not been tender I like orsythia I was very paranoid about taking birth control but orsythia was a lot better for me than I expected however if my migraines continue I will need to switch
4955,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42744,5,I was put on this BC because it was what my insurance was covering I was on it for about months Prior to using Orsythia I was on Lutera I am now back on Lutera thank goodness They supposedly have the same ingredients but Orsythia really made me feel awful Here is what went on Every month was different some months I was extremely emotional other months my breasts would get very tender all the way through the nipple ouch I would also get frequent headaches like maybe a week There was more cramping too I connected the dots and told my Dr and she switched me back to lutera and put on the prescription that there should be no substitutions I have been fine for the past months since I changed back Orsythia sucks if you ask me
4956,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42727,9,This birth control made me depressed It worked to prevent pregnancy but the side effects were not tolerable The worst was that I didnt realize it was the birth control and was so confused why I was so unhappy and dull Once I stopped taking it my mood improved Birth control reacts differently in each persons body but if you are prone to mood problems I would proceed with caution
4957,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42727,11,Ive been on it for about eight months now literally no side effects that Ive noticed Im very active and orsythia has never effected my athletic performance In terms of period regulation sometimes Im up to three days late or early incredibly light flow though that lasts for maybe four days Previously I was dealing with ten day periods and very horrid cramping every other month Ive had unprotected sex about times with no scares I do take the pill religiously Over all Id totally recommend this no bad side effects and anxiety over getting pregnant is completely gone
4958,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42718,16,Ive actually lost weight on this pill Every other birth control pill made me gain lots of weight Periods are short It has no side effects that Ive noticed Compared to other pills Ive tried this is the best I recommend it I do not get acne or crazy mood swings or anything of that sort on this pill It works beautifully
4960,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,42713,6,I was on Orsythia for months and loved it Before the prescription I would have normalheavy periods for days and experienced a lot of premenstrual mood swings After the pill my mood swings disappeared and my skin cleared up havent had a single pimple since I started I experienced spotting for around weeks in my first month but my period regulated after that My period then reduced to days of light bleeding manageable with just a panty liner I didnt gain any unusual weight and it didnt lower my sex drive I recently just switched to Nexplanon a hormonal implant I loved the pill but unfortunately it is a hassle to have to remember to take it every day reorder the prescription and take it with me when I traveled
4962,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,42693,26,Im mainly posting to balance out the negative reviews I have been on Orsythia for about a year and frankly it was a godsend Before Orsythia I turned into a crazed evil sobbing wreck every month Once I got on it I finally managed to get my moods and Mega Death Cramps under control Lexapro helped also If you have just been prescribed this i urge you to try it out and give it a chance Remember that satisfied customers almost never post reviews and it has helped a lot of women
4963,Orsythia,Ovarian Cysts,8,42682,4,I was taking orsythia for about years but I switched to a stronger kind which was the biggest mistake Ive ever made Orsythia did wonders for my acne I tend to get cystic acne but when I was on this pill I would break out maybe once every three months Also my ovarian cyst went away and my periods werent as painful and a lot lighter The only thing it didnt help was my anxiety but it definitely didnt make it worse I love this pill but it seems to effect everyone differently so you wont know unless you try it
4965,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42674,5,Ive been on this birth control for about a year and Im not kidding each month have freaking sucked like Im seriously on my period for to even days at a time on my period My doctor told me it would get better so after a damn year it still sucksDO NOT GET ON IT I have friends who experinced this as well It ruins my life I hate being off my period for only a week out of a damn month
4968,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42634,8,Ive been on this pill for year and Ive gained pounds Ive been the same size for years until I started taking this pill My emotions are crazy but it does make my periods shorter and not as uncomfortable
4969,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42634,8,Awful Im currently on this birth control and literally everyday I bleed And theres an odor that comes with it Its awfull Im going to give it a few days but its bad
4970,Orsythia,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42630,4,I was put on this because I originally had irregular bleeding Normally a week before my period I would spot have my period for about days and be done Since being put on Orsythia Ive already been fully bleeding for weeks plus week of heavy spotting before hand Needless to say I have an emergency OB appointment on Monday to get me on something else that doesnt make this condition worse than it already was The only two things this helped with was the life altering crampsbody pains during pms and it also did not take away from my sex drive though I could not even have sex because of the erratic bleeding I would NOT recommend this to my worse enemy
4971,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42624,10,Best birth control ever Lost weight and help with cramps doing period
4972,Orsythia,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42618,6,To preface this this is merely my experience for everyones experience may be differentI was prescribed this after having abnormal periods skipping months and upon arrival lasting for weeks in addition to excruciating pain During the first month the first week I felt somewhat nauseated and tired but the rest it cleared away Acne was gone period was lighterHowever starting now on the second month I am completely repulsed by food and have other gastrointestinal symptoms on top of preexisting conditions which is a problem for someone who does weight training and Im tired pretty often thus I will no longer be taking itAdditionally Orsythia has also made my mental illness symptoms far worse
4973,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,42615,10,I switched from the shot to the pill Bc the shot increased my appetite and I felt like I was going crazy with my emotions on the shot Since switching to this pill my appetite is back to normal and my crazed emotions are no longer existent Would recommend
4975,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42608,8,i saw negative reviews on Orsythia but decided to try it anyway but I wish I hadnt I was so anxious and had the worst mood swings I would get so angry over little things I wouldnt give a second thought to normally I snapped at my boyfriend friends and family practically once in every conversation when I used to be so calm and lighthearted I eventually thought enough is enough and switched to Junal Fe and finally back to my normal self Orsythia also made me completely repulsed by food so I lost about pounds but Im barely foot so pounds is a huge difference Only positive is that I didnt get pregnant
4976,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,41862,71,Was on Qsymia first had to stop in less than weeks due to side effects while driving but lost pounds On Belviq for weeks no side effects really watching diet and exercise but have not lost an ounce
4977,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,41859,173,This medicine really works for me I lost pounds in one month Less cravings for sugar or snacks Eating two protein shakes for breakfast and lunch Medifast andor Isagenyx and a lean meat and green salad for dinner Low carbohydrates and fat diet in general plenty of veggies and lean meat or eggs mins of aerobic exercise a day Like someone said its will power in a pill The only side effect was a headache the first two days and Advil took care of it Im naturally a relaxed and happy person but I do feel a general wellbeing and sleep better I also felt a little more distracted than usual for a couple days at the beginning but after that nothing else If you want to lose weight and feel better try Belviq Good luck to all
4979,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,41856,127,I just got a month script after finally trying the week trial I have fibromyalgia and wanted to make sure I waited an appropriate amount of time between taking this and any other meds I had been In days I went from to lbs The only side effect I experienced was minor headache and sleepiness which has now subsided I feel amazing Insurance wont cover but I did receive help from Belviq with cost I will pay for my future health

5046,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,41713,33,Ive been on Belviq for weeks and have lost lbs already I have hypothyroidism so I have been unable to lose weight despite trying and sticking with pretty much every weight loss diet or supplement available Belviq was a last resort and I am so glad I tried it I did have some mild headaches the first few days and my brain seemed to be on overdrive I actually had trouble sleeping initially although most reviewers say they slept better after trying BelviqI am also doing the Fast Diet diet nonconsecutive days of the week so I do think that helps I had been doing the Fast Diet months prior to starting Belviq but only was losing about a lb a week so the Fast Diet is not very impressive on its own
5047,Belviq,Obesity,10,41711,24,Only side effect occasional mild constipation IT HAS BEEN EASIER TO GET TO THE GYM AND EAT LESS WITH NO HUNGER OR CRAVINGS
5048,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,41711,48,Ive been on Belviq for days Im taking it for thyroid related weight gain Im quot and lbs overweight diet and exercise have not worked The first few days were rough Severe dizziness headaches etc In general I could barely function mostly because of the dizziness Now at day Im feeling much better no headaches dizziness is greatly improved etc I have lost lb in days this is impressive as I was gaining lbs weekly before Belviq I dont have enough time on Belviq to give a real review just wanted to say hang in there the side effects will subside after a few days Mine were bad I wanted to stop taking it luckily I stuck it out Im very excited about what Belviq can help me accomplish
5051,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42606,4,I started taking Orsythia about four months ago This was my first experience on birth control so I was incredibly apprehensive about the sideeffect namely migraines birth control and mood swings The first two months everything went so smooth These last two months I have been shocked with the adverse effects Ive experienced I have had issues with waterweight gain which fluctuates between and pounds and nausea But the biggest issue I have found with this medication would be the anxiety and depression At first I chalked it up to stress However people around me noticed that I have not been myself Ive felt edgy irritable overwhelmed confused and sensitive Im finishing this month then switching to a new pill
5052,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42596,14,I dont have anything but good things to say about Orsythia It regulated my periods really well reduced and shortened bleeding and completely got rid of my cramps I havent noticed any major side effects No spotting no weight gain and no acne issues Ive noticed Im sometimes a little bit more emotional during week but its never been of any issue or effected me negatively As of now I have no plans of changing from this pill
5053,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42595,7,This was my first time on the pill and I can say that it has been great I gained a few pounds the first month but I also started lifting weights and eating a lot more to help build muscle the same time I started taking it so I cant say definitively that the pill is what made me gain weight and by gain weight I mean like to poundsI havent gained or lost more than or in the past years as a high schooler so that was pretty significant for me It didnt clear up my acne but it didnt make it any worse Ive had no mood swings no cramps no pms symptoms no bloating really no side effects at all The only real change Ive experienced by taking this is that it made my period more regular and lighter I have no complaints
5054,Orsythia,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,3,42591,2,As I am not sexually active I cannot state upon the effectiveness of this as a birth control however upon taking this my anxiety and depression flared to the point that therapist is suggesting medication for that I have no experienced any odd weight gain although my hunger signals are off I do not get hungry nor full anymore My acne is the same as usual with no more or less cystic acne I am choosing to switch birth control brands to see if it will change but the emotional symptoms are just too much for me to handle
5055,Orsythia,Birth Control,4,42587,12,This pill lightened my period but I began to experience sore back sore breasts constant hunger and always felt tired I gained pounds since I started taking the pill but my diet remained I stopped taking the pill and instantly lost weight Ive been off the pill for a month and Ive already lost pounds
5057,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42582,10,I started taking this pill when my pharmacy switched it out from my regular Aviane Which are supposed to be exactly the sameThe first week or so I was incredibly nauseous Another thing Ive noticed is how incredibly tired Ive been I wake up tired Its really strange because this is a brand new thing since starting this pillMy sex drive has also taken a turn for the worst Mainly due to being so tired by the time my kids go to bed Im practically asleep myself That was never a problem beforeNow that Im nearing my st period on the pill I have extreme pms symptoms Mainly feeling weepy and actually crying about things I would not normally The worst though is my temper I feel like Im about to snap frequently
5058,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42580,5,From using this pill for a year I can say my opinion is firmly that Orsythia is not for me The pharmacyinsurance switched Lutera to Orsythia and I just went along with it despite the negative reviews This past year has been a completely different me my sex drive was fine bad cramps only once and then other time from the white week sticker falling off and accidentally missing some pills But my mood swings became so frequent and awful I experienced depression and suicidal thoughts and am glad to have switched out of this birth control I understand everyones experience is different but please dont be afraid to switch out of this birth control Or keep a mood diary if you experience unusual moods
5060,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42540,4,I just started taking this not to long ago and when I was supposed to get my first period it never came and Ive never had a missed period it could have been hormones but my lifestyle and stress levels didnt really change and when I got my nd period on this pill I barely bleed My acne has been so much worse I feel like Im back in high school Cant remember the last time I wore foundation and now I wear it everyday Funny thing is I take medication already for my face so you would have thought my doctor would have use common sense when prescribing this horrible birth control to me
5063,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42529,10,Love love love this pill Ive been on it for about a year and it has been the best experience ever It cleared up my acne helps with my anxiety and has done a wonderful job at preventing pregnancy Ive noticed a little bit of water weight with it but thats ok I dont mind it
5064,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42526,1,I was prescribed this pill so it could help my PMDD I have an anxiety disorder and during my tom I would have horrible anxiety attacks and depression This pill receives a for helping me with that issue however the other side effects dampened the positives of this medication It made my sex drive PLUMMET I felt like a menopausal woman for the duration I was on this pill Secondly it made my acne blow up for the first months I was on it It wasnt until I went to a derm and started using a topical treatment that it began to clear It also made me retain a few pounds in water weight and my boobs got bigger I just started triprevifem yesterday so I hope I can get my sex drive back
5068,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42505,8,I have tried probably about different birth control pills trying to find the right one and Orsythia is it I used to get yeast infections right before my period like clockwork not an issue as soon as I began this one I have been on it for years and sexually active the entire time without condoms and have not gotten pregnant I havent noticed any breast tenderness or nausea and I have a SUPER sensitive stomach and am nauseated by many things The only side effect I have been able to notice is vaginal dryness but this his happened with every hormonal contraceptive I triedClearly this isnt the pill for everyone but for people who are having trouble finding the right one give it a chance it truly changed my life
5069,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,42503,2,I have been on this pill for months and it is good except for the extreme nausea and it causes me to not want to eat sometimes So I have lost weight except in my boobs which actually stayed at my normal C cup If you have anxiety and anxiety attacks like I do just know that any hormonal birth control can make them more frequent
5070,Orsythia,Birth Control,7,42496,2,I was on this pill for years When I first started taking it I had the usual side effects upset stomach but when I took it with food I was fine However if you miss a pill only retake the missed pill not or you will vomit then continue the rest of the pack I never had any pregnancy scare my period always came on like clockwork In April of my period came on twice and the second time it did not go off for almost weeks My breasts were also super sensitive My doctor switched me the next month Other than that I had no issues and loved this birth control I recommend to watch out for unusual signals that may present themselves
5071,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,42494,4,Ive been on Orsythia for weeks The side effects im having are nightly nausea probably nights a week One night my first week i did vomit Ugh its been miserable The other main side effect is that i have had my period for days now Its a regular flow too That has honestly been obnoxious too I am not sexually active so i dont know if it is working to actually be birth control I will say though i have depression and anxiety and i have NO noticeable mood changes which is awesome also no weight gain Woo My boobs are a little bigger though Which isnt so bad anyways i think its a lot better than Beyaz which i was on about years ago
5074,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42458,2,I was on birth control for about years and decided to stop to give my body a break I got pregnant during that time and I started taking this birth control after I had my baby Ive been on it about months now So far the only good things is it has kept me from getting pregnant and cleared up my skin The bad thingsit has made me gain some weight I now start to get my period before my pills are done I feel like I am sweatier and it has given me large painful cysts under my right armpit I am debating whether or not to get off of this pill or give it a little bit more time
5075,Orsythia,Birth Control,4,42429,7,When I first went on the pill it was to help with my pmdd which I will say helped significantly However I have NOO SEX DRIVE I used to masturbate at least once or twice every day but now Im lucky if I can even make myself orgasm in a month Orgasms dont feel very good anymore and nothing turns me on Sex is painful and boring Other than that it did make my periods a bit shorter which is one positive of this pill The first week I was on the pill I was super queasy ugh Some other side effects have been weight gain only about pounds but still and horrible acne in the first months Im seeing my obgyn soon because my low sex drive is hurting my relationship and makes life miserable
5076,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42409,1,I have been on it for about months and it is great except for the fact that it makes me extremely emotional the day before my period and I have cramps on my period Both of which I never had before using the pill
5077,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42408,9,I was on Orsythia for about a year It did its job in that I did not get pregnant but I had to quit taking it because of the awful side effects Weight gain was minimal but definitely occurred After about months my acne became worse than it has ever been but even that wasnt the worst of it Orsythia brought my anxiety to an alltime high and I was experiencing awful mood swings All of these symptoms practically disappeared within months after quitting it I did not have anxiety before taking Orsythia and now even though it has been almost a year since I quit havent taken another birth control since I still have bouts of anxiety from time to time I believe my anxiety was triggered by this birth control
5078,Orsythia,Birth Control,4,42403,4,Im a veteran birth control user years and this one is soso I was on Seasonale for about years I had to switch to this one because my insurance didnt cover it anymore So far Ive been on it for month and if you have normal skin not prone to breakouts do not go on this pill It will break you out bad Even down there Which never happened to me before It does the exact opposite of Seasonale Seasonale dried the vaginal area and this pill makes you discharge so much its never dry hence the breakouts Moods are pretty normal Sex drive is a little bit better than Seasonale since you dont have to use lube Overall its okay Im going to switch though as soon as I am done with the pack
5079,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,42400,11,Ive been on this pill for about years Ive never really had a problem with this pill heck I have no complains really I just notice sometimes I get break through bleeding especially if I start a new cycle after skipping a month My skin remains clear my mood swings are in check plus I get a lighter period I really do believe this pill works differently for different people Yes my breast do get tender around my period but thats normal for my body I did gain wieght but Im not sure it was due to the pill Bc I do eat a lot Lol My body only filled out more in the right places I also have a healthy sex drive unlike when I was on the Nuevo ring
5081,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42381,7,I was on this for years and at first it was great It worked great BUT a few months into it I noticed I had no sex drive heavier periods minor acne flare ups I didnt have acne before amp extreme mood swings A year into it everyone started thinking I was crazy so I went to see a physiologist to help my moodiness A year amp a half in I realized nothing was helping I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression That was odd to me being that when I was in high school I was happy amp outgoing My family blamed my relationship for my unhappiness but it was the pill On top of that I gained lbs within the two years of taking it Now Im off that crap amp happier than ever Im normal me again amp my relationships with everyone improved
5082,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42377,8,Ive been on this now for a little over a year At first the birth control worked great for me I would only have about four day periods and I barely ever had cramps But starting about three or four months ago everytime Im not supposed to be on my period I will start on my first or second week of the pills and will be on it until my month of pills are gone Im not sure if its my bodies way of saying it doesnt like this pill anymore or what has this happened to anyone else Im going to my gyno soon and I want to either switch my BC or get completely off it
5086,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,42361,7,I was given this to treat my cystic acne and severe mood swings due to PMDD This isnt my first time on birth control either Orsythia has been working well a little too well My acne vanished my skin texture changed for the better and I no longer lash out at anyone for simply calling my name However now that its been in my system for months Ive developed dependent edema My legs swell up like balloons and theyre firm to the touch Anyway overall it works great but with that nasty edema Ive been switched to a lower dosage of another brand If you need a BC with some UMF Orsythia is your best bet If not find something weaker
5088,Orsythia,Birth Control,4,42359,2,For the first few months everything was fine My periods were short and light and I didnt experience any cramps After about a year or so I started gaining so much weight and experiencing mood swings increased sex drive and tender breasts I believe the birth control does its job but the side effects arent worth it I got off of them for awhile and my body felt so much better balanced but I got back on to regulate my period again because it came on every weeks Im switching as soon as I can
5089,Orsythia,Birth Control,7,42356,1,Everything was good with this BC except for the fact that it ruined my skin I stopped after a year took a break and started it again and both times I had terrible outbreaks all over my chest and face even though I had never had acne before Ive gone off it a second time and my skin still has not recovered I wish it didnt do that because I would like to stay on it but I cant handle the acne it gives me I never got mood swings or any other bad side effects while on it
5091,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42342,2,Age Japanese Ive been on this BC for about week and this is my first time to use BC in my entire life I was very worried about using Orsythia that is not approved in Japan I couldnt even find any info in Japanese so wasnt sure if it fits Japanese bodies Right after I started to take the pill I had the same symptoms as I do during period such as cramping On the th day I started to bleed but like a spot still need a pad I checked the Japanese site and found out that it was a normal side effect ppl have when they start to use BC So maybe even using different brands I would have the same thing The site said that the symptoms wouldnt last longer than months Im still bleeding on the th day but gotta see
5093,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,42331,7,Been on this BC for three months now I switched to this type in hopes that I would be able to regain my sex drive but I was a bit put off after seeing such terrible reviews Ill start by saying I do not experience anywhere near the severity of side effects most people are reporting I have not gained any weight but my breasts have filled out a bit I currently dont experience any mood changes although between the first and second month I noticed that I was quick to get angry at smaller things much more frequently This is no longer happening My only complaint is the acneI get a few cystic pimples on my chin on the weeks where I am on the active pills Overall I am very happy with this birth control
5095,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42322,12,So this is my first week on any kind of birth control Im experiencing a very heavy and painful period very low mood and depression and lots of crying and weeping I didnt think it would affect me so quickly Im not sure whether to ride it out for a month or just stop or switch I really cant afford to be this out of it given how demanding my work is If youve had a similar experience let me know
5096,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,42317,8,I started this pill June and have had only a positive experience No weight gain no acne and no pregnancies I use to get bad back pain and cramps however after starting the pill they are gone and my period only lasts days I do get emotional right before my periods do but nothing to extreme I would recommend to a friend as I know friends who have also had a positive experience
5097,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42314,7,Ive only been on it for one month so my opinion and perspective might be a little skewed However Ive experienced nothing but wonderful things I have acneprone skin and I have not had any major breakouts I have a curbed appetite now I do sweat more but only when Im being active My period is so light which is a definite plus I highly recommend at least trying Everyones body is different but it works for me
5099,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42307,2,So much acne all over my neck and chin area Its horrible I feel bloated all the time Going to stop this week I am acne prone so this just ruined my skin that had been fine for a long time I do not recommend this birth control for anyone
5100,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42302,8,I honestly didnt have a problem with this pill the first months I was on it After that tho my breasts grow and REALLY hurt every single month then shrink back to normal before my period begins Ive experienced nausea super low sex drive tender breasts increase of appetite you name it Im paranoid that Im pregnant every month on this stuff Im finishing the last pack and switching for sure
5101,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41762,10,I was originally on Lutera for a couple months my clinic transitions from Lutera to Orsythia occasionally They have the same amount of medicine in them so its pretty neutral My experience has been pretty good No headaches lighter cramps and shorter period days However I became moody where Id get very angry or very sad It fluctuated but was persistent during my placebo week My weight also increased a little went from a size to a with lots of bloating weeks of the month Not too horrible Ive been on this transitioning medicine for over a year and have not had any pregnancy scares or babies Does its job well with some side effects
5103,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41727,55,I was so scared to start this pill because of all the negative reviews so glad I started anyways I had been on the Mirena for years and didnt want another so my Dr prescribed me these First they were free under my insurance I have not gained ANY weight and have had zero side effects Other then making sure to remember to take them it has been a painless transition Dont be scared of the bad reviews what works for some may not work for others These have been great
5104,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41694,30,This pill has been pretty close to perfect No weight gain no depression and my periods are much lighter and shorter During the first few months my acne got really bad and I almost got off the pill but then it went away around month and my skin is pretty clear I think this was just a bodily reaction to the change in hormones The only negative is that this pill does make me drowsier than I used to be but I can manage And plus Im not pregnant so I guess its doing its job pretty well
5105,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41648,18,Ive been taking this pill for months now and Im calling my doctor today to switch Im constantly tired my cramping is more painful than when I was on a different pill that was discontinued I have days periods when I used to have day ones headaches all the time and absolutely no sex drive whatsoever The only positive thing I can say is no pregnancies
5106,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41639,6,I was on this pill for close to seven or eight months It was great at first absolutely no side effects until the last three months on it I was bleeding for four weeks at a time with one week of no bleeding in between This was my only issue with this birth control I have been on three other birth controls before this one stopped because they were discontinued and have never had any problems with any of them which just shows that I am not prone to mood swings or break outs cramps etc so this pill worked for me personally but may not work for just anyone
5107,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41634,17,Love this pill I tried Ortho Cylclen Ortho TriCyclen Loestrin They all made me emotional have angry outbursts and hazy feeling I didnt want to go back on the pill because of that but I wanted to give it one last shot It hasnt affected my mood or weight at all Everyones body is different If you have issues with a pill look up the hormone combination I noticed that the failures had one in common and tried to find a new pill that didnt contain that hormone Orsythia was one and I really am happy I gave it a shot What works for one person might not work for you Keep an open mind and keep trying until you find what works for you
5108,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,41633,13,I am on my th month taking this pill This is my first time regularly having sex without a condom and I have not gotten pregnant My sex drive is great but I have a lot of cramps and breast tenderness I gained some weight at first but I went back down when I stopped eating as much My periods have been long but relatively light Considering I can overcome the side effects and I get this brand for free it works for me
5110,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41566,22,After these reviewsI understand one thingall body is different I am taking orsythia for year and before I took other pills All of them have the same symptoms About gain weightgirls you just have to control yourself during taking pillsdo sporteat the same portion of foodnot double have wonderfull relationships and life is wonderfull Moodiness etc it is not because of pillsit is because of ur thoughts We use to think that someone or something is guilty in our problems Boolshet
5111,Orsythia,Birth Control,7,41541,21,Ive taken oral contraceptives for a couple of years almost years ago I decided to try again and was prescribed Orsythia While it does its job Im not pregnant Im constantly tired and sleepy my sex drive is almost nonexistent now my breasts often hurt and the first day of my period is very painful I can take Tylenol for the menstrual pain but other side effects are unacceptable
5112,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,41526,8,Been taking Orsythia for one month Ive noticed breakouts of acne along my jawline and some random ones on my upper lip some weight gain I feel a bit swollen at times my feet and my arms mostly My mood has not been affected Although I have been getting a lot of headaches since I started with this pill every day practically relieved by Tylenol
5113,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,41515,12,Taken for nearly a year Started after a terrible few months on Junel FE when I was depressed and anxious amp had no sex drive Before Junel Id taken Loestrin for ~ months neutral experience but my copay was so high I had to switch After a few bad months my doctor recommended Orsythia And my NEW insurance covers it at no copayPROSNo pregnanciesLighter shorter periods with somewhat reduced crampsNEUTRALMay have helped clear up acne although I think most of that was due to other prescriptions from my dermatologist CONSSomewhat decreased sex drive but that also could be from my antidepressant Escitalopram
5115,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41496,7,I switched to this from Loestrin FE and got my sex drive back acne cleared up and I barely notice that I am on this pill No longer dizzy or hormonally sad or feeling like everything is cloudy I also actually have a noticeable period and no longer spot throughout the month I do have bad cramps again but Ive always had cramps Best switch
5117,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,41489,11,Reading the reviews Im really jealous of those light period no crampers Ive only been taking Orysthia for weeks and at first it wasnt too bad I noticed significant weight gain during the past weeks and am on my first period on birth control They are killer I have never experienced cramps this bad I get sharp pains in my back legs shoulders and stomach Everyones body is different and this pill isnt working for me
5118,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,41486,14,I have been on Orsythia for about a year and on various pills over the last years and it was fine at first However in the last months have noticed a HUGE change Weight that I just cant seem to shed hormonal acne on my jawline and neck no sex drive and really awful moodiness and depression Everything else in my life is peachy so I knew it was my hormones due to this pill
5120,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,41459,9,I will say that from expirience everyones response is different and Ive had much worse reactions to different birthcontrol pills before but I will list all of my side effects that I had from this medicationsevere mood changes I cried ALL the time but I didnt feel angry just sad trouble wearing contacts swelling of the fingers when working out weight gain some water retention headaches and NO sex drivebut on a good side I had light periods light cramping no spotting and I didnt get pregnant
5121,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41428,3,I honestly do not remember my experience much from switching to this BCP a year ago What I can tell you is Ive had NO negative experiences What I HAVE just found out is you should NOT eat grapefruit or drink the juice while taking this pill I didnt know this and just recently began eating broiled grapefruit for breakfast these last weeks Well my cycle did not come and all I had was some spotting Freaked me out thinking I was pregnant
5122,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,41417,6,Ive been told that many people have negatively reviewed this birth control and Im honestly a bit surprised at that I am and I take Orsythia for birth control as well as period regulation and it does a fine job at both of those I take the pill very faithfully every night and rarely miss a dosage I am not pregnant so the pill is doing its intended job and I also get my period for about days during the row of white pills The only thing I dont like is that I break out a little bit more than I did on my previous pill Other than that I recommend at least trying this medication
5123,Orsythia,Birth Control,8,41387,18,I was nervous taking this med after reading negative reviews but after a rough first week that included nausea quelled by taking Dramamine a nasty headache having my face break out I am and do NOT get break outs and then break through bleedingeverything calmed and Ive loved the medicine ever since All the original side effects went right away and my period was extremely light and shortlove it Glad my Dr convinced me to stick with it because I almost quit taking it
5124,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41386,66,Ive been on Orsythia for one year and its been a breeze Zero side effects literally zero You will find a plethora of horrible reviews for this pill which is actually what spurred me to write this positive one Remember that people that are content with their pill dont always think to write a review I didnt Ive had no acne no weight gain no mood swings no pain short and light periods no spotting and NO PREGNANCIES Give it a try everyones bodies are different Just because other people have had a bad experience with a medication doesnt mean it will happen to you
5125,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41381,25,First time ever starting birth control and the reviews on here scared me SO glad I decided to tough it out Ive been taking it for months and the only symptoms I have had are a little more emotional outburst two days before my period not that big of a deal I was always prone to PMS emotional outbursts anyways and breakthrough bleeding the first month No weight gain no acne actually less acne I realize all women are different but just thought Id share my mostly pleasant experience with this pill Oh and of courseit works Not pregnant
5126,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42073,26,Im just about to finish my first month of Orsythia and I love it Everyone will have a different experience but mine is great I have no bad side effects I dont know if its the birth control but ever since Ive started taking it my acne has been under control Ive lost weight and my breasts seem a little bigger I dont have any cramps or feel any more tired than usual Definitely happy with this birth control
5127,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42058,9,I was previously on Tri Previfem and had horrible acne cramps and mood swings on it Switched to Orsythia and I am currently on the third week My acne is totally gone Ive gotten one pimple this month I would get while on TriPrevifem No more mood swings and I am totally satisfied with it
5128,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,42053,4,I just recently switched from Minastrin Fe to Orysthia so far the only problem I have had with it is much more acne the good side to it is that I only get my period for about three days and so far I havent had any spotting Im going to stick it out for a couple of months to see if the whole acne issue goes away
5130,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42016,15,Got on Orsythia because of PMDD Used to be suicidal right before my period After taking the pill Im MUCH more balanced Only criticism is it makes my breasts extra sore during PMS And the first couple months I had spotting But overall its great And its definitely done its job to prevent pregnancy
5133,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,41993,15,Ive been on the pills for months and I have been so emotional as in depressed Ive had a little bit of acne but its not that bad No weight gain in fact Ive lost pounds Very very nauseous but cant throw up Headaches here and there Im not sure if Ill switch just yet Ill probably try it out a little longer
5134,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41976,6,I have had no problems on Orsythia and have been very happy with it My periods are much lighter and of shorter duration I did not experience weight gain decreased sex drive and my skinmonthly breakouts did not increase I have seen a small enhancement in breast sizemass which was not a dramatic increase but I was pleased about that I rate it a because this is the only pill I have tried so I cant fully rate it a without any form of comparison I also had wished that I would completely prevent my monthly hormonedrop associated breakouts but those were just high hopes Overall for me an effective pill in preventing pregnancy without any adverse side effects to speak of
5135,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41966,7,Since Ive been taking the pill after giving birth and suddenly I get car sick easy I get headaches all the time and my stomach gets crazy sick I dont know what to do because it does protect me
5136,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41961,13,It was great take it at night though to avoid stomach trouble But it worked great no acne or bleeding
5138,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,41892,22,This pill has made me so emotional Ill be crying over the most pointless things and cant seem to control my emotions I was never like this before although it has lightened my periods
5139,Orsythia,Birth Control,6,41880,37,I have been taking this pill for two weeks now and I have noticed Ive been feeling super fatigued I am usually energetic and outgoing but the past two weeks all I have wanted to do was sleep even while Im out with friends Im still tired
5140,Orsythia,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,41867,9,I have been on Orsythia for months for controlling dysmenorrhea or painful periods Before starting birth control overall two years ago I missed at least two days of school and work a month because my cramps backache nausea and headaches prevented me from doing more than sitting in bed crying After Orsythia I barely get a period it lasts four days and I rarely need to use anything more than a pantiliner I get the occasional cramp but nothing unmanageable I love this pill
5141,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,41866,14,Ive been on this pill for months and Ive gained pounds Im bloated the first two weeks of my pills Its terrible I always start in the middle of my row of my active pills and my period is long Like days Not happy Im calling to switch I switched from Minastrin Fe which was terrible too
5146,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41809,12,I have been on it for three months and have gained over pounds while on my regular gym schedule I also never get pimples and I have had about in the past months
5147,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,41794,16,Ive been taking birth control for three years now The Orsythia is the only birth control that has made me gain weight Im constantly hungry I get moody a lot And Ive only taken this pill for three months
5148,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41794,3,When I first started taking Orsythia I loved it It even caused me to lose weight I would only take it in the morning or afternoon sometimes at night when I would remember and I never got pregnant My pharmacy switched me to Lutera and I had irregular bleeding I know its the same main ingredient I am not sure if the dosage changed but I did have tender breasts I actually thought I was pregnant but that was impossible because I had day periods I felt like I was always on my period It was annoying Then I got used to it I feel as though I may have gained some weight but its all water weight and bloat Now I am taking Aubra its the same ingredients so hopefully my body adjusts and I go back to being skinny with hardly any period
5149,Orsythia,Birth Control,7,41774,10,I have been on Orsythia about two weeks My doctor prescribed it to help control my terrible PMS and cramps I am bloated constantly It looks like I have a little baby in my belly My pants are tight and it sucks but I am going to stick it out and hope that it will go away after a month or so I have been sleeping terrible and I am tired all the time My breasts are tender and I feel a little like in a cloudnot really depressed but not excited either I havent had any problems so far with acne and my appetite has actually decreased I am hoping it will all level out in a few months
5150,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41770,25,I had been off birth control for about years after a horrible experience with Loestrin Fe I was terrified to get back on the pill After my partner and I weighed pros and cons we decided to get on the pill Im so glad my doctor prescribed this brand I was a day starter and immediately I felt relief from cramps I have had no cramping at all since I started Very much unlike Loestrin and period was light and only days long RELIEF Ive had to control my emotions at times Ive noticed Im slightly more emotional my breasts are slightly tender and my stomach thinks its hungry all the time Dont give into the tummy grumbles Keep yourself on a healthy diet and you will not gain weight So far no weight gain at all
5151,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,40843,12,I feel the same way as the other person I was also previously on Lutera and the pharmacy switched me to Orsythia and I am having the same side effectsand a few more
5152,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,40810,25,I had been on Lutera several years and never had trouble with it My pharmacy switched my medication to Orsythia I have only been on it weeks and I am unbelievably bloated my clothes hardly fit I have gained weight probably due to the bloating my skin has broken out My husband thought I was going through puberty again I hate to see what the third week is going to bring I had an appointment with my doctor and told her about my symptoms and told her about the pharmacy switching my medicine She wrote another prescription for Lutera and told them not to substitute I want my Lutera back
5153,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42298,3,Was on this for weeks for general birth control It did exactly what its supposed to do but the acne it caused me just wasnt worth it I didnt have mood swings or anything like that I did however lose some weight If you have sensitive skin this might not be the right one for you
5154,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42285,7,I have only been on orsythia for about month and I just started my second week of my second month I guess I didnt notice earlier but I started to get slight headaches and I didnt feel very well physically and mentally It do help with my cramps and my period not so much my acne but its better The worst part of orsythia has to be the mood swings and the sweating I sweat a lot even if its cold Ill start a light sweat its gross But the mood swings are the worst I just started feeling this and it happened while I was talking to one of my friends I just blew up on him for no reason Then later on I started to feel really badmentally and I cried for a while and I couldnt figure out why I was crying I dont recommend
5155,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42263,10,I never have a problem with this birth control Ive been on Orsythia for at least years I see all of the bad reviews which I find interesting Ive never had a problem I dont get cramps anymore and I have a very light short period Ive never gotten pregnant Very effective for me
5156,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42247,7,My pharmacist switched me to Orsythia after my regular birth control Aviane was unavailable In the first hours on Orsythia I having terrible mood swings and anxiety Then came the bloating weight gain and acne Im now on my placebo week and my hormone levels have dropped so rapidly that I feel like a crazy person Cant wait to get off this stuff next week PS I would HIGHLY recommend Aviane to anyone looking for a lowdose birth control pill I was on it for years and never had any problems
5158,Orsythia,Birth Control,6,42239,5,Very slight nausea feeling when I take it but I learned to avoid it by taking it just before I go to sleep It makes my breast swollen which looks good but feels horrible Its fairly painful It causes me to sweat more then normal and causes excessive vaginal lubrication to the extreme Some people my not mind but when its so noticeable you feel like you peed yourself and you no longer have friction during intercourse to the point of embarrassment a problem Ive never had I never got pregnant so thats a plus
5159,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42233,8,I used to have really bad cramping and a really heavy flow before I started this birth control Ive been taking it for a year now and my period is only four days compared to the week and a half it used to be I did gain a bit of weight but it was all in the boobs area Love this birth control
5160,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,42230,8,I started this pill June and have had an amazing experience No pregnancies no weight gain and no acne though I wasnt prone to it before I do get emotional and tired but nothing a nap and breathing cant fix what works for some may not work for others I definitely would recommend me and a few friends have had very positive experiences
5161,Orsythia,Birth Control,5,42227,2,My experience so far is not that good but not that bad either However I would like to try a different brand besides this one Ive been using this brand for about years When I first started this Birth Control I had very bad headaches for the first or months My appetite at that time also increased My acne was getting worse as well but its a good thing it has cleared up Ive been feeling so bloated and depressed lately that I felt like crying for no reason at all I have had some chest pain as well which I think is known as heartburn It doesnt happen often though Now the pros of this brand is that I havent had bad cramps like I used to My periods have been regulated and light Its not horrible but its not great either
5162,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42219,5,My experience was horrible I had to stop because all the side effects became too much for me and it was affecting my every day work As soon as I started taking this I began getting headaches nausea dizziness and my skin completely broke out I have had good skin my whole life and my face completely broke out Also my hair started falling out uncontrollably I was afraid to even run my hand through my hair I stopped taking this when these side effects became unbearable and my lips even broke out I began getting a lip rash and getting bumps all over my lips The doctor said it was one of the side effects in addition to my face breaking out I was also crying all the time and overly emotional The side effects were too much to handle
5163,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42213,10,This birth control is by far the worst of any other Ive taken I have experienced severe mood swings and temperament depression bloating AWFUL chest back and facial acne and constant food cravings I would never wish this drug on anybody
5164,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42207,5,This is the worst experience I have ever had with a birth control My acne is worse and my mood is awful Ive felt depressed for the whole time Ive been on it where I just want to cry for no reason or if something does not go right I have had calf cramps as well My normal birth control is Lutera and I have no complaints about it
5166,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42203,7,Was only on it for months to regulate my period Started out okay and period were light and on schedule The last months I was on it I had my period for two weeks Also made me very depressed I gained weight craved food and retained water and felt bloated all the time
5168,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42191,5,My experience has been horrible I feel like throwing up all the time The worse part is just the feeling of it Also my boobs are sore and my body aches I feel super blooded and I actually look blooded I guess this pill reacts in different ways for different people however for me has been a horrible experience Some of the symptoms I have experience are Calf Cramps headache continuous nauseas body ache as if I was getting the flue headaches
5169,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42191,5,I did not have a positive experience with this drug This was given to me when my normal BC was on backorder and I didnt think anything of it and began taking Orsythia Within days my face began breaking out like crazy Absolutely horrible painful acne whereas normally my acne is under control Sure I suppose it works as a birth control but to me it isnt worth this negative side effect
5170,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42185,4,absolute worst birth control Ive been on My last brand was discontinued and was given orynthia Ive had my period for out of the weeks I have been on it
5171,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,42172,5,Ive been on Orsythia for a year and half and Ive had a regular cycle twice I get it early and it lasts days and its just brown not a true period Recently Ive started to get the bad acne everyone mentions Im and have pimples on my chin and forehead never had it before It has eliminated my breast tenderness and cramping though thats why I strayed on it But its just too unpredictable and so I changed to another birth control I do not recommend it
5172,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42157,7,I found this drug to be very effective I had previously tried loestrin Fe and Minerva and had awful side effects mood swings crying etc within the first week of taking each drug I then took orsythia for months and had no side effects I was not at all moody bloated did not experience breakthrough bleeding and did not become pregnant Although the pill has many bad reviews Id recommend this birth control to people who may have had bad side effects on other birth control hormones and are looking for one that fits their needs
5174,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,42146,5,This worked as birth control but it made me break out with the worst acne Ive ever had all over my face
5175,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,42117,4,This is by far the worst birth control I have ever experienced I have been on the pill for years and this was given to me as a filler between my annual exam I normally have a different brand I had no idea that brands can differ so much and I thought nothing of it Right away on this pill I became sick to my stomach and thought I had the flu I had horrible gas and heartburn My breast hurt horribly I got horrible acne all over my chin Then by the third week I started to feel mild cramping in my calf and sharp pains all over my body This pill has inspired me to go off the pill in general Horrible experience
5177,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,42084,19,I used to get extremely heavy periods and very severe cramps and I was looking for a birth control pill that would help with it My OBGYN prescribed me Orsythia and I was a little worried about side affects from what Ive read online from others But I had none No weight gain mood swings acne or nausea Nothing at all My problems with cramps and heavy periods went away within three months and there was a definite improvement right when I started taking it No more cramps or acne and my periods are now super light I cant speak for everyone since hormone pills will affect everyone differently but this pill was a perfect match for me Id highly recommend it for birth control and managing difficult periods
5178,Nimodipine,Migraine Prevention,8,42849,4,Works well for both my Migraines with Aura and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome No side effectsFor POTS it works well for my overall symptoms such as the improving my cognitive performance reduces the fatigue to a some degree and helps me tolerate exercise longerIt only reduces the tachycardia itself by like BPM but that is far better than nothing
5179,Nimodipine,Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10,39849,13,This drug helped me recover from my subachroind anuerysm It is a miracle drug No other on the market does this I was informed that they are no longer making this drug I am worried in less than a month I cant get this drug The generic doesnt have the same effect that Nimotop does and I want to know what to do
5181,Orsythia,Birth Control,7,41372,8,I dont have insurance but do have a discount at my pharmacy Ive used Lutera for years Last month I was switched to Orsythia and did notice my mood changed a bit was so hungry therefore gained pounds I did have a super light period and my breasts didnt hurt at all this past time I needed to start eating good anyway and Ive lost weight and I now know whats causing my increases anger so Im more mellow myself again I like Orsythia and plan on not switching
5183,Orsythia,Birth Control,6,41340,5,Im glad there are reviews for Orthysia because now I know that I should go to my doctor and talk to them about it since Im experiencing the symptoms given in these reviews I started on Orthysia three months ago due to Lutera being discontinued In the last two months Ive experienced a frustrating loss of appetite mood swings trouble sleeping and increased heart rate
5184,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41332,8,I like this pill Ended my nd month and no nausea or irregular bleeding I was on a higher dose pill before and was absolutely sick from it My period is right on time from last month and I will continue this pill It works great considering the condom fell off a few times makes me absolutely thankful Im on birth control
5185,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,41320,14,I was taking Lutera and doing great with it My pharmacy made me switch because Lutera was being discontinued I am on my third week of this medication and have not been feeling well I have been moody and agitated and feeling as if I am in a fog
5186,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41317,18,It works well Ive been on it for months I think the only bad thing is that I spot before I start the last week of pills Its not a big deal but its kind of annoying I was switched the first month from Lutera to Orsythia and I didnt have any side effects from either I havent gained weight my sex drive is great and I havent had any random breakouts Its a good pill
5188,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41309,14,I have had no problems on this medication Was switched around to a couple different other generics for Alesse for years I have been on Orsythia specifically for over months have seen no difference with this and the others I have had no side effects at all OrsythiaAlesse has helped my mood and my adult acne It has also made a major difference with my periods Now lighter shorter with little to no cramping
5190,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41292,103,I would just like to state some things for anyone reading the negative reviews and getting worried because these comments stressed me out for weeks It is important to understand a couple things For one people who experience no negative side effects dont tend to write reviews because they are so content with the product that they dont think about it Secondly all birth control pills affect each individual completely differently What one person thinks is the best pill another will swear up and down it is the worst If your doctor prescribes this pill for you dont be too afraid to take it Give it a chance and it may be great for you as it was for me If its not just stop taking it and find one that better suits your body
5191,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41289,20,I was switched by my pharmacy from Aviane to Orsythia After three months of trying it I have requested to go back to Aviane or try something else It made me have longer periods and mood swings I would feel like I wanted to cry at everything I am glad I read the reviews on here and it was not just me
5192,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41288,16,Like many other reviewers I too was switched by my pharmacy from Aviane to Orysthia I decided to give it a try because my doctor said that they both had same ingredients and made by the same company I never experienced any side effects from Aviane even when first taking them Since Ive been switched to Orysthia Ive experienced all the unpleasant side effects nausea massive weight gain lb to lb breakouts and major mood swings
5193,Orsythia,Birth Control,9,41287,22,This was the first birth control that Ive ever tried and Ive honestly experienced no problems with it I had mild nausea for the first two months and an irregular period but my body quickly adjusted to it I think that all of the bad reviews on here are from people whose body was just SO adjusted to that other pill that they just couldnt take this one My sex drive is good my weight is steady face is clear and Im NOT pregnant
5194,Orsythia,Birth Control,3,41285,6,I had no problems when on Aviane or Lutera but since my insurance switched me to Orsythia my periods have gotten a bit longer and my cramps have gotten worse With Aviane and Lutera I barely had any but now theyre back to like before I was on the pill Plus my breasts have been achy when they didnt use to be and Ive had more headaches One month I was even worried I was pregnant because I was so tired bloated and had so many headaches Im hoping I can get my doctor to write me a prescription for something else if my insurance doesnt cover Aviane or Lutera when I get my refill next month Not terrible but not as good as Aviane or Lutera
5196,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41229,14,I was also switched from Aviane to Orsythia I am halfway through month two and the fatigue bloating and nausea are so bad I actually thought I was pregnant I will be stopping midpack as I spent the entire day at work trying to not get sick all over my desk Im also waiting for my doc to write me a new prescription
5198,Orsythia,Birth Control,2,41198,2,I had been on Lutera for more than a year with no side effects or issues to speak of My pharmacy switched me without notice to Orsythia and my biggest complaint after less than three weeks of use is that Im now experiencing deep painful breakouts around my chin which Im attributing to Orsythia since it has been the only thing in my routine thats changed Needless to say Ive already met with my gyn and will be switching to a new pill as soon as this packs done
5199,Orsythia,Birth Control,7,41190,11,I was given Orsythia because my pharmacist switched me from Lutera This birth control actually kills my appetite resulting in a little weight loss and even better increased my breast size My main complaint is that I get large deep breakouts on my chin but a salicylic acid facial cleanser is helping with them Also I wake up in a bad mood every morning I have only been on this birth control for a few weeks and definitely isnt as good as Lutera but I will wait for my body to adjust a little more I would definitely say give it a try before you call your pharmacist screaming
5201,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41154,10,I have been on this for about months now I have been moody gained weight and feel overall not good I am so bloated at times and my breasts hurt all throughout the month
5202,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41153,5,Ive been on Lutera for about a year and had no problems at all Then my insurance switched to Orysthia and Ive been having mood swings acne and what seems like week periods Im going back to Lutera
5203,Orsythia,Birth Control,10,41128,39,I like this medication I was scared to try it because I read all of the bad reviews I had been on Ortho TriCyclenLo for about yrs prior to trying Orsythia and had no problems but wanted to switch because of the cost No acne no mood swings no period changes Well I thought Id do people who are considering switching pills a favor and give you hope youll probably be fine
5204,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,41003,13,I was on Mircette for over years and loved it No side effects Due to insurance changes I was switched to Lutera and eventually given Aviane Again no side effects My mail order recently had a manufacture change and sent me Orsythia I gained pounds mostly water weight had mood swings and shortness of breath I could barely fit in my clothes and my periods were so inconsistent I DO NOT recommend this pill Im going back to Lutera
5205,Orsythia,Birth Control,1,40882,15,Orsythia was also given to me in place of my usual Lutera I have never experienced side effects of any kind with Lutera but Orsythia has caused me to have frequent headaches moodiness and fullblown menstruation in the second week of active pills
5206,Zonisamide,Seizures,2,41377,65,I was on this medicine at first mg a day then mg I turned into a completely different person Im normally a happy positive amp outgoing young woman On Zonisamide I became extremely irritable amp depressed I flipped out over the littlest thing I also lost a lot of weight because my appetite essentially disappeared I weighed about lbs when I started and dropped to lbs I finally had enough when the depression kicked in I would have suicidal thoughts multiple times a day It was scary and debilitating I cried a lot for no good reason My performance at work and my relationships were suffering so I called my Dr and switched to Lamictal
5207,Zonisamide,Seizures,10,41356,34,Diagnosed generalized juvenile myoclonic epilepsyCompletely stopped my sons seizures he is only years old
5208,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,9,41207,54,I dont notice any side effects compared to some of the other antiseizure medicines
5209,Zonisamide,Seizures,8,41077,14,A little weight loss Very good seizure control No other side effects for me
5211,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,9,40912,92,Ive been taking Zonegran for a few years now at mg per day It had really gotten my headaches under control to where I would only have a headache periodically Weight loss has been a side effect that I havent minded The problem is Ive had significant memory and focus issues I hardly felt competent most of the time I have slowly weened myself down to mgs per day I notified my neurologist of this because its an antiseizure medicine so you shouldnt stop it cold turkey or it could cause a seizure My memory has improved significantly but the headaches have returned with a vengeance Im back to taking narcotics to address each debilitating headache I used to take Topamax It too worked beautifully but also wiped out the memory
5212,Zonisamide,Seizures,8,40887,21,Been using this a short while and it apparently works for me
5213,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,7,40875,44,On mg and have seen a huge improvement in my migraines Down to per month
5214,Zonisamide,Seizures,8,40750,31,On maximum dose with Keppra and still having some break through seizures Still less then I was having before No side effects Had a full term pregnancy while on medication Baby is very healthy
5215,Zonisamide,Seizures,8,40728,48,I have recently been on Topamax and Keppraboth maxed out My headaches were worst and my seizures were still happening My doctor finally switched me to Zonagran months ago I am seizure free headaches have been much better and I feel a lot more normal I do have a low appetite but not to where I cant eat I love it
5216,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,6,40632,92,I have used Zonegran for headaches only It is the only thing that seems to have lessened them somewhat but I still have headaches and they affect me cognitively Im mentally slower have wordfinding problems my memory is bad and my attention is terrible Ive tried to go off it on occasion but my headaches get absolutely awful so I stay on it
5220,Zonisamide,Seizures,1,40371,22,The medication wasnt helpful in controlling my seizures Its been about five months and I have had painful migraines just about every day One day well find one that works
5221,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,40366,29,No seizures while taking but have had bad bruising and constipation going on years now But Ill take no seizures over the side effects
5222,Zonisamide,Seizures,10,40313,12,Been on Zonisamide for maybe years probably more cant remember exactly no grand mal seizures what so ever Try not to take it late at night though Take pills all at once any time during morning hours or even early afternoon But this is the best for me anyhow
5225,Zonisamide,Seizures,4,40088,16,Going to Zonegran from Trileptal still waiting for the headaches etc from the Trileptal to go away
5226,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,40066,43,Ive been on this for over months now and seizure free since then I do have a very mild loss in appetite but that has not stopped me from eating only how much I eat Side effects are the lowest overall from all the other medicines Ive been on in the past Topomax Triliptal Depakote amp Phenobarbital Best of all its only once a day
5227,Zonisamide,Seizures,10,39902,25,Stopped my seizures
5228,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,39875,29,Loss of appetite but seizure free
5229,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,39809,35,I love Zonegran I have no seizures while on this medicine The only time I experienced a partial seizure was recently when I began including yogurt in my daily diet Since I excluded that Im seizure free again
5230,Zonisamide,Seizures,7,39745,32,I like Zonegran overall I havent had a seizure since I started taking it
5233,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,10,42374,40,I was taking Excedrine Migraine daily to control my headaches I saw a neurologist and was put on Zonegram It took month to build up to mg per day I was headache free after months and have been that way for months now I will step down from the pills in months No side affects for me at all
5234,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,42373,31,I have taken Zonegran brand name only for about years I have been seizure free ALL years Prior to that I was on Topamax brand name only I was seizure free years I had one seizure in that time due to exposure to mold Zonegran is the BEST medicine I have ever had I do have word finding and short term memory issues that are frustrating and sometimes involuntary jerking of my limbs as Im trying to go to sleep In all honesty I would not use anything else I dont have to worry about seizures I just take the meds and live my life So much so I am finally driving a car which is something I thought I would never do because I didnt trust my meds
5235,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,7,42367,20,It has stopped my migraines for almost a year Ive lost weight and muscle stone my appetite has gone
5237,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,1,42211,11,Im taking this as a last resort have tried every med out there Next stop is a Clinic in September Have had migraines for more than yrs
5238,Zonisamide,Benign Essential Trem,10,42192,13,Since Ive started taking Zonegran I have not had ANY flare ups of tremors in my hands No bad side effects however one good one It has helped me lose weight
5240,Zonisamide,Seizures,10,42177,6,Had a brain tumor removed in and was on dilantin and phenobarbital for over years Got rushed to the hospital for what was thought to be a stroke and ended up being a seizure My new Nuero Dr put me on Keppra with phenobarbital this worked great for about years Just got out of the hospital again because of a seizure and am now on mg of keppra and mg of zonisamide daily At first I had a hard time sleepingonly about an hour a day my fault as I read the prescription bottle wrong I was suppose to take the Zonisamide once in the morning and here I was taking mg in the morning and mg at night So far everything is fine as I am only on week of my new dosage My Dr also wants me to lose weight so this is it
5242,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,42142,10,Have been seizure free for over years now Ever since my doc put me on zonegran BUT there was a short time I was having bad migraines so he put me on Topamax evil drug caused me to have short term memory loss to the point that I was forgetting I was forgetting Changed Doctors and back on Zonisamide and all is good As for side effects I have daily fatigue and less of an appetite but who cares compared to one or more seizures daily
5243,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,42114,41,I have been on Zonisamide for years Ive tried several other medications to control my seizures but always switched due to side effects hair loss depression etc Zonisamide works the best so far for me I love it I havent had a seizure in years and Im very happy with my quality of life The only setback is my memory I have wordfinding issues big time It gets very frustrating when I can see the person or the thing and not say the word I have a Bachelors degree in English so you can imagine how annoying that is But I would choose Zonisamide over anything else for sure
5245,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,9,41969,54,I have been given many different diagnosis Hemicrania continua primary trochlear headache Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia currently I have migrainous type chronic headache with Atypical Facial Pain I was on mg Topamax with a bunch of other stuff and this helped but I couldnt add It was like north pole magnets coming together Now I have been on mg Zonisamide Zonegran for about years and I have a reduction in pain As for cognitive impairment I can live with the loss of spelling and reduced vocabulary Its not that bad compared to either the pain or Topamax
5247,Zonisamide,Seizures,9,41746,55,Zonegran unlike Keppra and other seizure medicines give you a natural feeling closer to a normal feeling Some seizures still slip by for me but only when its closer to my menstrual cycle or ovulation time my seizures seem to be directly linked to fluctionations in my womanly cycles other than that this medicine has been the best one for me and has been a great relief to me
5248,Zonisamide,Seizures,10,41655,62,Been on this medicine for a long time years It decreased my seizures a lot and my headaches Also decreased my appetite and Ive lost weight which I have no problem with Out of all seizure medicines Ive been on I highly suggest this one
5249,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,7,41651,74,I took Topamax for a while and it worked wonders but the side effects were insane However the zonesamide works very well for preventing my migraines I take mg a day Word finding and memory I dont even know what those are anymore However I was living in constant pain Nothing was working for me This is the only thing that has done anything for me in years
5250,Zonisamide,Seizures,8,41603,35,I have been taking Topirimate for complex partial seizures following my second sub arachnoid bleed in but started to lose my hair so I am now taking Zonegran and since changing over I feel very well and the hair loss seems to be much improved and I am feeling great
5253,Zonisamide,Seizures,10,41556,69,I have been taking Zonegran mgdaily for years I have complex partial seizures that generalize about of the time I have tried just about every other medication out there and this is the only one that has kept my epilepsy under control I do have side effects some depression anorexia defined as loss of appetite I started this medication weighing around lbs and now after three children weigh lbs and cant remember the last time I was hungry and I have noticed that it is harder for me to retain information and I sometimes have to read things twice to understand them where before Zonegran I easily understood and retained information Despite these side effects I wont ever try a different medication Totally worth it
5254,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,10,41515,42,I started having migraines suddenly two years after the birth of my first and only child Sought help from a Neurologist eventually when antidepressants prescribed by my family practice Dr didnt work My Neuro doctor started me out on Topamax first which I had terrible side effects from word recall was awful and I felt paranoid and edgy all the time Zonisamide has been a game changer So far limited side effects some dizziness not bad rash on my upper arm not a big deal Ill take this in exchange for the life altering migraines that pretty much shut me down any day
5256,Zonisamide,Seizures,6,43059,0,Effective prevention of seizures but I only had two episodes months apart started at age Started at mg twice a day increased to mg Was prescribed to go up to mg but requested to stay on the mg as I had no episodes and didnt like the effect it had on me I am now used to it but it makes me drowsyBig downside is I have just found out that I have osteoporosis and it appears that zonegran is contributing to accelerated leeching of my bones Will be discussing with neurologist in a couple of weeks
5259,Zonisamide,Seizures,1,42978,0,I began taking this drug July I had to take myself off of it because I had enough of the side effects My docter would not even consider me withdrawing from it completely from and telling me to wait for the appt with my consultant neurologist in the UK which I could not do months Side effects were terrible aching burning patches all over my body very low mood not quite depression I have been diagnosed with Epilepsy since I was but the side effects were worse than the condition although I did have several seizures I am an English woman living in the UK I have to include that side effects started several months after taking this drug and I can positively state that it was all because of this DRUG Zonisamide
5260,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,5,42874,9,The medication worked well to prevent migraines However after one month of use I developed joint painswelling and a rash It was determined I had drug induced lupus and the medication was discontinued
5261,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,10,42868,9,Was diagnosed with Occipital Neuralgia and the pain was excruciating plus days a month in pain Now taking mg Zonisamide and have been pain free for days straight First time in years So far not experienced any side effects
5262,Zonisamide,Seizures,2,42835,7,Extreme Weight loss tremors at night increased seizures loss of memory shaking panic attacks loss of selfconfidence extreme depression
5263,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,7,42824,9,I have tried everything in the book preventatively but this is the st thing thats worked with the fewest side effects that I notice I havent noticed any of the brain fog or cognitive issues that I know ifbut maybe I have them and just dont know lol Im on MG for a few years now lost weight at first which I didnt mind at all But recently every time therea going to be rain in the forecast I wake up with a migraineI wake up have a headache check the weather and sure enough theres rain today so I take a concoction and lay back down til it goes away Im going back for my regular checkup next month and were gonna have to discuss options coz I cannot manage life around the weather like this
5264,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,9,42792,18,In the past I had been given all types of medicines for migraine prevention and by far Zonegran has been THE BEST Ive had very few side effects that I can notice The number of headaches that I normally have are decreased tremendously I can really tell when I miss doses of the medication because the headaches come back full force but once I get the medicine in my system again everything is all good If you havent tried Zonegran PLEASE DO
5267,Zonisamide,Seizures,3,42754,4,Im currently on zonisamide zonegran Ive been on it for years now to the point that its doing nothing for my seizures and everything for my weight and mood that I dont want it to I now suffer from not getting an appetite at all my migraines are ridiculously painful to the point it sometimes makes nauseous or even vomit I wish theres somethin someone could do to help
5268,Zonisamide,Seizures,7,42723,9,Ive taken this drug approx years While it was appropriate at the time I began my health has changed making this drug dangerous Renal failure kidney stones amp osteoarthritis are among the top reasons this isnt appropriate now I know at the drug leaflet proclaimsquotyour doctor has decided the benefits outweigh the riskquot BUT thats not his decision to make my bodymy decision New Doctor
5269,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,1,42712,17,I was prescribed Zonisamide and took it for about weeks before I was diagnosed with DRESS Syndrome severe drug reaction I landed in the hospital for a week and later was told to have drug induced Hepatitis after having experienced a rash itching fever high liver enzymes triple levels of bilirubin loss of Magnesium and Potassium and severe upper quadrant pain The treating physicians sought the assistance of other specialists being that they were extremely concerned and had never seen such a bad drug reaction Im told that my liver will recover only they are not able to anticipate how long it will take Its been two weeks since I was taken off this drug and Im still experiencing the issues mentioned above
5270,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,9,42712,28,Well it all started with dizzy spells that got so bad I couldnt even stand up I was in the hospital for almost hr They had no idea what was wrong They suggested I see a neurologest ASAP After making the appointment to see who they suggested I wouldnt be able to see them for months So I reached out to my family They said to see a headache specialist That sounded crazy to me at first After meeting this new Doctor the same day I called him He put me on Topamax I believe it was called which I had almost every side effect from So he decided to put me on zonegran small doses and work my way up This medicine is amazing I have no side effects at all and no more migraines for about a year now
5271,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,3,42703,23,For Migraine Prevention Ive tried amitriptyline Imitrex propranolol Fioricet amp Topamax and for a while and they worked but the side effects were insane However the zonesamide works very well for preventing my migraines I take mg a day Word finding and memory I dont even know what those are anymore However I was living in constant pain Nothing was working for me This is the only thing that has done anything for me in quite some time so do I walk around with a child like mind or not be able to get out of bed because of the pounding migraines
5272,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,8,42603,26,I have been taking mg of Zonegran daily for about a month and have noticed a reduction in the amount and severity of my migraines
5273,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,1,42592,9,Ive had migraine since I was No preventative had ever worked We do control the a symptomatic inter cranial pressure with acetazamide mg day Recently my imatrix started causing rebounds and my monthly migraine totals shot up from shot worthy where the migraine causes a dark spot in the white matter in my brain month to and I am living off of excedrine migraine Neuro put me on this to be preventative Ive noticed little to no difference and am finding Im gaining weight and am fighting depression and hopelessness when Im alone Neuro wants to up dosage to mg day but I dont think I can handle that On a side note in order to try to get off meds in going to look into the implants because I cant maintain this
5274,Zonisamide,Seizures,3,42554,15,This is one of the worst AEDs Ive tried over the past years since surviving Reyes It caused hostility agitation nervousness restless legs syndrome suicidal thoughts and made me so impulsive that I requested an early retirement from a position paying about k per year I probably would have not gone for retirement if the effects of the med had not been there To top things off it gave me gingival hyperplasia so my front teeth are ruined gum overgrowth is worse than it has been while on any of the other meds Ive been given Intractable epilepsy is tough but this med might help persons who havent had trauma or brain surgery FDA and the maker FAILED to warn me about this I got off of it
5275,Zonisamide,Seizures,2,42551,3,I first took it in as part of the study It was so so didnt work sufficiently and the epileptologist took me off of it for fear of kidney stones impacting a teenager When having major problems with Onfi and having tried meds over the past years I thought Id see if Zonegran was improved A physician at Georgetown University in DC failed like FDA to proved information stating that the med can make a person who has had trauma andor brain surgery go into orbit It controlled seizures a few months made me do impulsive things like request retirement from a position paying over kyear It made me hostile nervous go nuts and elevated my Dilantin level caused gingival hyperplasia so my teeth are painful and ruined
5277,Zonisamide,Seizures,10,42487,8,I had my first seizure at age Reason still unknown The doctors had a terrible time getting them under control My husband and I didnt know what was going on Zonisamide gave me back my life I had some side effects at first but they passed after about a month The side effects I had were drowsiness and a feeling of confusionbut all of this passed Then things slowly got back to normal Now I have been on the Zonisamide for years and have been seizure freecompletelyfor years This is a good med It saved me
5280,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,7,42439,18,Have suffered with headachemigraines for years and have tried many meds Tried Topamax a couple different times and finally had to get off it for some of the side effects and it really kinda stopped working for me On dose mg of Zonisamide and seems to have decreased the frequency and the severity of my migraines Have noticed a bit of a loss of appetite at this current dose and thirsty and dry mouth All in all happy so far with my current situation
5281,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42649,3,I started this birth control a few days ago and been dealing with bad cramps stomach pain and tightness in my stomach when I yarn or cough Its just so awful that I stayed in bed most of the day I discontinued it today and going on another birth control that I love and had no side effects My doctor switched me to Cryselle despite me telling her I want to stay on the other one now she switched me back Not trying to scare anyone but its best you avoid this medicine
5283,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42645,5,This is the worst form of birth control I have ever been on I gained pounds in a month without changing my diet Im normally an anxious person and get hormonal around my period but this pill intensified everything I cried almost everyday and got angry over stupid things and I didnt have any anxiety free moments through out the day at all on this pill Terrible headaches and nausea I just got off of it so Im hoping it all goes away soon I dont recommend this
5284,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42634,3,Breakthrough bleeding all month for almost two years extreme irritability to the point that I came here to read others moods when on this drug Also the PMS symptoms last all month long I am only level headed when its the week off No sex drive bloating cramping nausea fatigue and really greasy hair I am going to ask for a new pill I tried to stay on this pill but its bad in every way
5285,Cryselle,Birth Control,2,42628,9,I was on Cryselle for about years I had severe fatigue and lack of energy was physically exhausted and drained no matter how much sleep I got my hair was falling out like crazy I had water retention and headaches I was irritable and moody and I had extremely low sex drive I eat healthy exercise regularly and have had my thyroid and blood sugar checked as well as blood tests for anemia etc all came back normal The fatigue and lack of energy was what really bothered me and after doing my own research I discovered this can all be related to my BC Im now trying a new pill Each person is different so what may work for someone may not work for someone else The positives were my periods were very light and I did not get pregnant
5286,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42618,4,This is my second time around of being on it and its way worse than the first time Well at least the first month was HORRIBLE and when I say horrible I mean horrible My period had came way too early it came like the second week starting the pills lasted the rest of the month cramps were so bad that they woke me up out of a dead sleep every hours nothing helped to ease the pain Happened more at night but I had them during the day as well It was that bad I almost had to call off work and Im the type that never calls off Id have to be dying Now Im almost through my second month its going A LOT better This month was better than last I suggest to give it time let it run its course even if it gets horrible like mine did
5287,Cryselle,Birth Control,5,42612,3,Was on this pill for two years Gained about pounds had cystic acne around my periods and my mood swings were unbelievable I would find myself getting so angry and irritated at everyone and everything for absolutely no reason Perks were I didnt get pregnant and my periods were short and light with no cramping This was my th pill I tried and after this I gave up and switched to an IUD Couldnt be happier
5289,Cryselle,Birth Control,2,42585,5,I have been on Cryselle for about a year now and I could never understand why I was feeling so depressed irritable and down After I stopped taking them I didnt have those issues anymore so you do the Math If you dont want to feel like youre breaking down mentally I would not recommend this product
5290,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42571,16,Most of these reviews arent so good and most of the reviewers arent giving their body enough time to adjust to the hormones Your body is trying to get used to the pill so thats why during the first month you may get some unpleasant side effects like mood swing and acne I had nightmares for the first weeks sore breasts after that and acne breakouts My first period on Cryselle was horrible the cramps were awful but everyones different Im still going to give my body the opportunity to adjust to cryselle If youre having some unpleasant side effects while on Cryselle talk to your doctor especially if its something serious But dont be quick to give up the pill because of things like acne and sore breasts Things can improve
5291,Cryselle,Birth Control,8,42570,5,Ive been on multiple different bc pills because I always end up getting breakthrough bleeding after months or so This pill Ive been on the longest years and I just started experiencing the breakthrough bleeding months ago It would start around my second week of pills and I would begin with all the pms symptom first Swollen breast bloating mood swings Then I would have spotting for a day or two The spotting would go away but the pms symptoms would stay until I got my period at the scheduled time So the bloating and swollen tender breast for weeks out of the month got old so my doctor switched me to aleese Ive yet to try it But over all I didnt have a bad experience with cryselle I would highly recommend it
5292,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42559,8,Ive been on Cryselle for months now Ive had acne all my life and had finally gotten it under control before starting Cryselle Its out of control again Additionally Ive had some serious anxietydepressionmood swings I cry all the time and have irrational obsessiveanxious thoughts The benefits definitely did not outweigh the costs My GYN is switching my prescription
5293,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42555,9,I feel like based on all these reviews you either love it or you hate it This works wonders for me The first inactive week the first period o had on it was HORRIBLE But after that as my body adjust it really helped Also I know its terrible but when I was younger I had unprotected sex and I never worried because I always get my period on the rdth day of the inactive Been on them for about three years now would recommend if you have very little medical history to worry about
5294,Cryselle,Birth Control,2,42555,7,I started this birth control completely fine the first week After the first week I started bleeding bad and continued to take the pill I had been bleeding for months straight while on cryselle
5295,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42551,4,This pill is honestly so terrible The first week I began taking it I started to break out all over my face with extremely painful cystic acne It was uncontrollable As soon as I started to take the inert pills my face cleared up Also this has caused me to form a fibroadenoma in my breast and I have an extremely extensive family history of breast cancer in young women Im only years old and I have fibrocystic breast disease and Ive been on just about every birth control on the market If you have this condition as well STAY AWAY from this drug at all costs
5296,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42547,6,No complaints hereBEST BC Ive ever been on
5297,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42538,12,The first three weeks on cryselle were pretty awful I had headaches and stomach pain constantly But after the first three weeks all of that ended amp now I take it without any issues As long as you get through those three weeks amp stick it out its awesome Ive lost weight my periods are light and short amp my acne is gone Definitely recommend this Just push through those first three weeks
5298,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42528,4,I swear this pill made me so anxious I would have so many panic attacks and always feeling the worst was about to happen It always got better on the period weekthe week not on the pill obvi I dont knowI dont recommend this pill to someone who may struggle with anxiety or depression I did perfectly fine on Ortho Tri Cycline other than I had switched due to the irritability I felt I then realized Id rather be a grump than always going in panic mode
5300,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42494,4,Horrible absolutely horrible I was on low ogesteral and my pharmacy just switched it to cryselle one day Within a week a felt depressed and withdrawn and completely not myself I felt like and would cry at the drop of a dime for no given reason I barely made it threw one pack before I came off and actually spent a month off birth control until I could get an appointment to get a new pill I am very sensitive to estrogen so it is possibly that I am an exception but I have never had this experience on other birth control pills
5303,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42443,6,I have been on Cryselle for a year and month and I love it I used to get the worst acne on my chin but my face cleared up for the most part while on CryselleThe first weeks on it I was kind of nauseated and threw up once on the first week I was irritable a bit the first weeks And my first period on it was painful I started Cryselle because I had unpredictable painful periods amp it really has worked my periods are light and only last days Almost no cramping sometimes none Plus I know when Im getting my period and Im able to make sure I am not on my period on important an important events Plus it has protected me from getting pregnant ever since i became sexually active First month is tough after that its amazing
5305,Cryselle,Birth Control,2,42425,5,Bad I took it for about a year then it gave me bad acne that automatically cleared away when I took a week break from it and automatically came back when I got back on it It has also make my hair so dry frail and frizzy regardless of how good I take care of it My blood pressure anxiety and mood swings also fluctuated when I was on and off this pill Good makes my periods ultra light almost never cramp Havent gotten pregnantOverall I would not recommend it if you can be on something else
5306,Cryselle,Birth Control,8,40178,12,Since starting this brand of birth control two years ago I have gained forty pounds During the two years I exercised thirty minutes a day seven days a week Despite the weight gain this pill worked very well for me and I never had any other problems
5311,Cryselle,Birth Control,4,42383,10,I have been on this pill for months now amp I have to say it has been awful I do not feel like myself Im really irritable angry depressed amp my sex drive is GONE Ive been working out daily amp eating right amp still gaining weight Ive also got awful period acne breakouts on Cryselle The only positive things are that the pill does its job and my periods are days max theyre also light
5312,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42379,0,Since this is a common side effect I am going to ask my provider about it I am experiencing a lot of breast tenderness It started pretty much after being on this one or two days I am a week in and its rather painful They feel somewhat swollen
5313,Cryselle,Birth Control,8,42374,5,Ive been on this pill about months now Its my rd birth control Tricyclics give me bad migraines and I was on minastrin before this Minastrin always made me really sad for no reason too nauseous to eat very moody and depressed and had no period Cryselle was such a big turnaround for me Im back to my normal happy self periods only last days rarely any cramping Only thing I noticed was a little bit of weight gain but that could also be from switching as the last birth control made me too sick to eat half the time
5314,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42367,7,I began talking this pill months ago to help with my PMD The weeks following my period I had extreme irritabilityanxiety My periods were also very heavy and accompanied by severe cramps and extreme fatigue and headaches My doctor recommended this pill to level out hormones and help with cramps This pill has been amazing My periods are days long and very light I have NO cramps My face has cleared up except for a couple breakouts on my chin the last day or so of my period but they are gone in a couple days I feel so much better on this pill Incredibly lower levels of irritabilityanxiety
5315,Cryselle,Birth Control,5,42366,2,Ive been taking this pill since February and Im not a huge fan My mood swings have been terrible when I PMS and when Im not PMSing I feel blah My sex drive has decreased and that is my main concern because not only am I more dry but I started crying after sex because I felt horrible My boyfriend isnt happy with it either Im switching to Loryna because it has a lower dosage of progestin that should make me happier but Im still nervous
5316,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42363,0,Ive tried many birth controls probably about eight but this one stands out in my memory as the worst just because of the side effects I will say I can appreciate a short period four days I believe I was on this pill for only a month a while back but if I recall correctly that was the month I reached my highest weight ever gaining ten pounds I got rather irritable and was glad when I switched to Quartette and apologized for snapping at people ^
5317,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42353,2,I would rather deal with days per month of cramps than living every single day of my life with acne female baldness was getting there anyway nauseavomiting migraine headaches skin peeling no sex driveinability to orgasm irritabilitycryingdepressionanxiety insomnia panic attacks shaking high blood pressure Omg stay away from this stuff if you can
5319,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42346,8,Like another user below I was also on LoOgestral since I was for cramps and to regulate my period I was getting it twice a month and it was so painful About years ago my local CVS started carrying only the generic version of it which is Cryselle Im now and have had great experiences with both My period is days long with no crampsif it didnt come the same day every month I couldnt even tell when its coming My skin has never been better I honestly had no idea people has such depression and mood swings from this pill Ive never felt any of that I also lost about pounds while taking cryselle not from the pill itself but I worked out and ate healthy So no weight gain
5320,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42320,5,I got pregnant on the pill so I do not recommend unless you wanna get knocked up Lol
5321,Cryselle,Endometriosis,9,42307,6,I was diagnosed with stage endometriosis and had a chocolate cyst which was removed months ago However excruciating pain and cramps persistedI was so drained all the time and attributed it to my busy scheduleA month ago I went to the obgyn because my cramps became daily They found a lemon size cyst on the right ovary and told me to go on Cryselle for months to shrivel it Before I could start taking it I had a horrible bout of pain fever nausea dizziness that felt like my endo symptoms I think my cyst burst because the persistent pain was gone Doc said to to take Cryselle anywayFirst week I got a few big pimples and expected to gain weight and be moody It did the opposite felt like my old self energetic amp happy
5322,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42299,0,Ive never really been a pill taker but after kids and heavy flow I decided to take something and this is what the doctor gave me My legs and arms fall to sleep my vision is blurred I have terrible headaches and my mom is crazy How can you take this mess with kids and still be able to function Needless to say I will stop taking them
5323,Cryselle,Endometriosis,2,42290,1,My body does not react very well to hormones I spent just over a week on this medication and experienced vomiting every single day My physician mentioned that nausea was normal so I assumed this was typical as my stomach is generally a little more sensitive than most anyway Besides it wasnt too bad just once in the morning Once my body had woken up I was just fine However the last few days I was on the medication the adverse reactions increased Vomitting increased to several times throughout the day nausea increased from the first few hours of the day to the entire time I was awake and had several fainting spells accompanied by severe twitching luckily my doctor ruled out seizures Scary
5324,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42268,16,I have been on this birth control for years I feel like the reviews are based on people that havent given their body time to adjust to it On this pill I had no acne problems no weight gain no crampy periods Generally my periods would be days long without pain sometimes would forget it was that time of the month So while on it this pill was great I recently almost months ago got off due to how long Ive been on it and hyper pigmentation on forehead and cheeks Now I feel my periods and gained lbs Considering getting back on againespecially since hyper pigmentation is pretty much gone
5327,Cryselle,Birth Control,2,42236,10,The only benefit to the birth control is that is prevents pregnancy It has caused me major mood swings anger and sad pain in my breasts and acne breakouts I have never had issues with acne even as a teen Its not worth it
5328,Cryselle,Endometriosis,9,42236,2,After being diagnosed with Endometriosis in July my doctor decided to have me take this birth control pill to help with the terrible stabbing pains of the Endo I must say I noticed a huge difference in pain the next day after taking my first dose I have not been in pain for a week now Thank you Cryselle Also so far no major side effects but its too early to say I only had some nausea the first days Time will tell if any additional side effects should occur
5329,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42235,17,Cryselle is great Ive been taking it for about months now and have been very happy with it When I initially read the reviews on Cryselle back in May I was nervous to take it since not many women had a positive experience with it but went ahead and tried it anyway My skin has been extremely clear and my period is pretty comfortable Cramps are very bearable and the cycle itself only lasts a few days I was a little nauseous the first day I took it in May but it went away after a day All birth controls react differently to each body so dont be turned off by all the negative reviews on Cryselle Its the best pill Ive been on in years Definitely worth a shot if youre on the fence I couldnt be happier with it
5330,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42234,3,was not on BC for many years till my dr recommended birth control in order to help with my endometriosis Ive been on this for a month and a half and no progress in period or cramps and Ive never had worse acne than I do right now I hardly wear any make up and rarely ever get pimples and what started as a dry scaly rash type thing on my chin and jawline has one week later turned into burning red acne all over my face Ive also noticed how severely depressed I have become Although I have struggled with depression throughout the past years I have never ever felt this depressed or uninterested in anybody and everything everything and everyone irritates me Once I looked up others reviews I decided I will not take this again
5331,Cryselle,Birth Control,7,42234,1,This birth control isnt bad defiantly not the best but not the worst Before Cryselle I had almost perfect skin with occasional breakouts here and there but I break out on my chin often now Its not bad and it goes away in a couples days or so but before the pill that almost never happened It made my period a little shorter by a day or so I do have very bad mood swings but Ive always been kind of a moody person so it might just be me But other than that this pill is good I havent gained any weight I dont spot I occasionally get mild headaches But nothing a Advil couldnt fix
5332,Cryselle,Birth Control,8,42232,7,Everyone is giving this drug a bad rep Ive been on pills this one only makes me moody just before my period which is normal for someone not on birth control no weight gained and my acne isnt awful By not awful I mean Ive had acne for years and in the past year on this medication it hasnt been as bad as it has been in the past No medication is perfect but this is a pretty good one I think a lot of people blame this medication for their life problems when that just may be their life
5334,Cryselle,Birth Control,6,42231,0,this birth control definitely regulated my period and made them lighter and has done its job helping with pregnancy obviously but since Ive been on this Ive broke out so bad around my chin and cheeks and I will be honest my skin has never been great but it hasnt been this bad in a long time and I feel like the scars last so much longer I thought if I kept taking it my skin would clear up but it didnt other than that I didnt gain weight Im pretty sure my sex drive was the same no spotting or any other possible side effects one thing that mightve been the cause but Im not sure but I may have gotten more depressed but that also might just be the cause of the bad breakout since I very much care about my appearance
5337,Cryselle,Birth Control,5,42228,0,I started taking Cryselle because the higher dose pills like TriSprintec made me throw up At first Cryselle made all the nausea go away and I lost weight After about a week I started having pretty severe mood swings and started getting the worst acne Ive ever had I got huge pimple all over my facethe long lasting painful ones It was not a great experience
5338,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42225,1,Absolutely the worst birth control My skin has become horrible and Ive had to start other medications to help my skin this last month The mood swings are horrible and I will be switching to Yaz
5339,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42220,3,I have been taking Cryselle for just over two years and have been fighting depression weight gain terrible heafaches and anxiety attacks for the entire duration I live a very stressful life but I was always optimistic and could fight through it Until I started taking this pill After about months I tried to commit suicide my depression has become debilitating and I have anxiety attacks at the most random moments without any triggers Ive been off the pill for about a week and my mood is already improving This pill changed who I am completely I lost my friends and became distant all because of the depression Im not sure how to be me again or who me even is anymore Be careful and watch out for any side effects
5340,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42217,1,I began this birth control months ago Ive always had a difficult time with birth control but this was my far the worst I have been so depressed to the point of having suicidal thoughts I havent had any energy or motivation My skin is more oily than its ever been but drier than its ever been in a few areas My hair started thinning My anxiety was off the wall and my skin itched without a rash Everybody annoyed me for no reason I have yet to find a birth control that works for me
5341,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,42214,3,I was put on cryselle to help regulate my cycle and clear up what was left of my acne and I have to tell you this is the worst experience of my lifeI went from my skin being almost clear to having cystic acne covering my entire face and chest which was also very heart breaking for me because my cheeks were the only place where I would break out Ive also become very moody and more depressed I really do encourage you to steer away from this pillIt has honestly been the worst decision Ive made in a really long time Save yourself the pain and money Im looking to switch ASAP
5342,Cryselle,Birth Control,7,42213,2,I had really bad cystic acne and went to a dermatologist and the medicine they gave me didnt help much so I went on Cryselle My face has cleared up SO much ever since Ive been on this pill but I have been very moody Ill be happy then sad to where I want to cry and then the next minute Ill be extremely happy again I have not gained any weight while on this pill and Ill skip my period every months and theyre very light with no cramps Overall I plan to stay on this pill until I cant deal with the mood swings anymore
5343,Cryselle,Birth Control,7,42205,1,Ive been on cryselle for a year and a half I Havent had any side effects till recently I take packs then have my period I have extremely bad cramps but I always have No birth control has ever made them better I noticed just last week when I was off the pill and on my period I was happier I do have mood swings that are sometimes crazy I also dont have a sex drive I will be trying a new form of birth control to see if my mood changes along with my sex drive but Im scared to try new things while by body adjusts If nothing works I will get back on cryselle
5344,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42202,1,I used to take ogestrel which is a high dose I have been onogestrel for over years I am on the pill to help regulate my period I got a new GYN dr and he wanted to change the pill to a lower dose so I started on cryselle I gained Pounds Diet physical activity was the same as before in fact I was more physically active but I still gained all that weight My primary dr thought it was me that I was over eating or not active That she doubt it was the pill I went from a normal BMI to crossing the obese border after starting cryselle I told my dr I wanted to change back to ogestrel Within the first few months back on orgestrel I started to lose the weight
5345,Cryselle,Birth Control,7,42177,3,Ive been on Cryselle for months now the first month I was an emotional wreck crying over nothing and just super bothered by anyone and everyone Its gotten better now but the week of my sugar pills Im still on an emotional rollercoaster My periods shortened from days to about which is nice My face breaks out during my period and is blotchy but I cant completely blame it all on the pill since it happened before This pill didnt make me gain any weight I actually lost about lbs during the first two months Overall this pill has been alright At the very least its been effective but I am considering switching it up
5347,Cryselle,Birth Control,3,42156,5,Ive been using this pill now for about a month My mood has changed drastically Im always depressed most of the time I Wana cry it makes me feel really nervous and I cant stand most people feeling stressed I lost few lbs which is a good thing and it controls my weight since I have hormonal imbalance But I hope to get off this pill asap
5348,Cryselle,Birth Control,5,42113,1,I had very irregular periods so my doctor put me on this pill to help regulate them My periods come like clockwork now which is very nice considering Ive never had that They havent become lighter or shorter in length which I was hoping for They are still days with heavy flow and lots of cramping My acne has also increased a lot I had some acne before taking the pill but this is the deep kind that can take weeks to heal which I rarely got before I also have been pretty emotional since starting it but I wont entirely place blame on this pill as I stay pretty stressed regardless but I think it could be related Im going to switch soon most likely
5349,Cryselle,Birth Control,3,41926,12,I have tried a few pills before and this one was the worst I would sweat constantly during the day and even wake up sweating The acne I got was pretty bad as well I was taken off the medicine when I reported to my doctor horrible headaches and seeing auras which is a really bad sign of serious problems to come All bad side effects aside I did not get pregnant while on Cryselle however this pill was not right for me
5350,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41893,13,Cryselle was the th or th pill I tried in my journey to find a birth control that improved my cramps heavy flow and regularity without intolerable side effects which was also covered by my insurance Ive been very happy with it It has all but eliminated my PMS symptoms and although it didnt have a marked impact at first my cramps have become less severe and my flow lighter the longer Ive been on it I havent experienced any negative side effects either If anything my mood seems to be more stable on Cryselle Ive been on pills that made me crazy Its also been effective as birth control
5351,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,41855,27,I was on LoOgesteral and was very happy with it but my doctor stopped carrying it and prescribed me Cryselle saying it was the same thing Ive been on it for almost months now and am just as happy as I was with LoOgestral My period used to be really heavy and lasted a week before I was on birth control Now it lasts days and is pretty light to moderate depending on which day Im on in my cycle never heavy No break through bleeding no crying jags no acne no weight gain The only thing that happens to me is the first few days of a new pack I get nauseous after taking the pill But I get nauseous easily
5352,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,41800,29,Today marks the second month Ive been on this pill In the beginning it was fine except that my face was breaking out really bad I thougth I would deal with that until about a week or so ago I started getting terrible mood swings I cant stand the person who sits next to me at work I cant stand my boyfriend my friends anyone I thought I was just having a bad week until the past two days I couldnt stop crying and would randomly burst out crying in public places I called my DR and she told me to get off the pill immediately I will sign back on and let you know how I feel a week from now
5353,Cryselle,Birth Control,5,41783,11,I switched to Cryselle after a terrible experience starting birth control with Junel On that I bled without break for months So Cryselle seemed like a Godsend when the bleeding stopped and I had no spotting between periods Minimal side effects besides increased acne My skin was fine before but Ive been on this pill for just under a year now and in recent months have developed horrible painful cystic acne I am looking into a new pill now
5356,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,41702,24,I switched to Cryselle two months ago because my periods were very heavy on my old birth control Since switching to Cryselle my periods are very light I have very little cramping my face has been clearer and I have been headache free I wish that I had switched sooner
5359,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42999,3,This is my first birth control I have ever been on Ive been on this pill going on two years It does its job in the field of preventing pregnancy The only thing I dislike about it is I get very moody at times while on it if I skip a pill and have to double up on it the next night I get a real bad headache I have experienced weight gain as well which no girl cares for But like they all say every one is different
5361,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42972,1,I was prescribed Cryselle for extremely heavy periods due to a fibroid tumor The bleeding I experienced not only interfered with my daily life but also caused anemia and seemed to only be getting heavier by the monthI started taking Cryselle months ago and havent experienced any negative side effects other than the expected break through bleeding month two which I attributed to my body adjusting to the medication My periods are much lighter AlsoPMS type symptoms like sore breasts and bloating have significantly decreased Im very pleased so far with Cryselle
5365,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42872,6,I really love this birth control but as someone else stated I think it might be affecting my libido I havent noticed any weight gain at all since Ive been using this I have been on it for over two years and really have no true complaints My skin is completely clear during my placebo week and relatively clear the rest of the time But I still have some random nasty breakouts This could just be my skin type though and might not have anything to do with the birth control I was on a high estrogen birth control before this which negatively affected my mood but I feel great on this one I dont ever find myself feeling super moody just my usual self My period usually lasts days nothing bad at all Overall I recommend it
5366,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42863,6,Ive been on this birth control for about years so I feel I can write a fair review I started taking birth control in high school because my cycle was so painful and heavy I had to miss school because of cramps As soon as I started taking this the generic version was called something else back then my symptoms went away I went from a day heavy painful period to a day light period Ive always had acne and I cant say this helped tremendously when I was in high school and college now that Im in my mid s my acne is gone I havent noticed anything related to hormones on this pill Yes when my period is about to come sometimes Ill get a little more emotional than I would during other parts of the month but that would happen even if you werent on the pill The only thing Ive noticed is that my libido is higher during the placebo week I think birth control might kill libido a bit Overall if you have terrible period pains I would recommend this pill It really saves me every month
5367,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42851,3,Ive been on the pill for more then a year now amp I love it I used to get really bad headaches before horrible cramps amp a heavy period twice a month The pill changed everything no more constant headaches no cramps or any menstrual symptoms no acne light flow amp no weight gain The pills been great to me
5368,Cryselle,Birth Control,5,42851,4,I gave this pill a because it DID protect me from getting pregnant so the pill does the job Pros Easy to take Protected me for years Did not gain any weight Sex drive stayed normalCons Constant chin acne Bad PMS that would start a week after getting my period so I felt like I never had a break That food cravingsore breasts emotionalangry feeling would pop up weeks before my period even started Basically it was week of normal and the rest was all hormonal Overall the pill does what you need it to do Protects you from pregnancy However I cant take the emotionsacne so Im on the hunt for a new pill
5369,Cryselle,Birth Control,3,42843,8,I took this pill for years and in those three years I THOUGHT nothing was wrong but I was really emotional and I got depressed before my periods I thought I had just changed but as soon as I went off this pill all those things went away Be highly aware of your emotional state before and during
5370,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42821,9,I have been on Cryselle for three going on four months now It is great The only side effect I have is some dizziness I was put on this as part of treatment for hypothyroidism and it has resolved my hormonal imbalances I was previously on minastrin FE and I gained weight and bled for three months straight The day I started Cryselle the bleeding stopped and I have had no breakthrough bleeding whatsoever My skin is clear mood is good but I am also on wellbutrin I have energy enough to exercise six days a week and have lost lbs since starting this pill in the last week of December which is exciting because I had been unable for years to lose this pesky thyroid weight gain Sex drive through the roof not pregnant
5371,Cryselle,Birth Control,8,42803,4,My doctor put me on Cryselle after years on Microgestin Ive been on Cryselle for years now I switched pills bc of headaches VERY tender breasts and the pill causing zero libido Im not exaggerating Cryselle improved my headaches although I still have them they are not as bad Breasts are also not as sore although Cryselle caused them to grow huge Libido is better but only by like which is generous Overall my experience with Cryselle has been positive Also I havent gotten pregnant so it obviously gets then job done
5374,Cryselle,Birth Control,4,42776,1,I have been taking cryselle for about weeks now It is much better than my previous birth control brand TriEstarylla My previous birth control caused weight gain had horrible mental side effects and caused various other problems Using cryselle has eliminated all of these problems for me I cant say I love it just yet but it is definitely better My main issueconcern is the spotting Ill wake up in the morning and itll look like I just came on my period This pill also moved my cycle up Im used to having periods starting around the middle of the month but this first month using the pill it came on the st Ill speak to my doctor about it but Im pretty content so far with this birth control
5375,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42763,10,Ive been on Cryselle for two years now and I absolutely love it I actually lost weight since taking the pill and have maintained this new low weight ever since My periods used to be days and filled with unbearable cramps and heavy bleeding My periods are now days and extremely light My boobs get a little sore before Im going to begin but thats how its always been for me Everyones different I experience little to no cramps with the pill which is amazing compared to what I used to deal with I can remember having to stay home from school because my cramps and bleeding were so severe it would make me sick Im years old and began taking Cryselle at I highly recommend
5376,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,42758,4,I have been taking Cryselle for years now and I love it Havent had any side effects and the way it helps keep my period regular is awesome I know exactly when to expect it and how long it will last Before Cryselle I was taking another birth control that made me nauseous gave me headaches and would give me periods a month I love that I found Cryselle and I will continue to use it
5378,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42751,2,Ive been taking cryselle since I was I am now I needed a medication to lighten my periods because I have severe anemia Overall I was satisfied with this birth control I did have side effects like weight gain I gained nearly lbs over the last years which isnt normal since I have a strict diet and work out every single day My periods were still heavy at first But during the last year and a half my periods last days and are very light like spotting I am sexually actively so I was worried that I may have been pregnant but tests say otherwise I had random acne before my periods on my chin and cheeks I craved salty foods around the time of my period so that could be the culprit of my acne Cramps werent awful There would be cramps that stopped my in my tracks but they lasted a few seconds and I was fine Its just the normal period symptoms that are normal to have I am currently switching to lo loestrine and have read more bad reviews than good ones So Im not sure that I want to go ahead and start the pack after my last dose of cryselle or not
5380,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42676,1,Ive been on cryselle for about years never had a problem No side effects never experienced a headache but I never get headaches prior periods always come on the rd placebo pill day and last days and the rd day is spotting No crazy hormones and no acne AT ALL The first pack u will experience nausea as any birth control pill because the hormones but should subside by the second pack I did stop taking the pills after about years when I noticed my vaginal mucus started smelling funky for about months when I stopped birth controll completely it went away and then I had a baby just finished my first pack of cryselle post pregnancy and the same smell is back Maybe I was on it for too long though Hope this helps
5381,Cryselle,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42662,0,On the third pack and bleeding has yet to stop Sometimes the bleeding is actually lighter on the week of my period
5382,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,42662,2,I first took cryselle when I was and I had the worst side effects break through bleeding headaches anxiety attacks weight gainand my periods lasted weeks Got on it again when I was and had Little side effects My periods are a little heavier and hurt a bit more and have very sore boobs other than that its a charm No pregnancy

5384,Xgeva,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,1,42721,7,I have Lung cancer w mets to bone Two hours after the injection I experienced the worst pain ever in my life I walked into the infusion area without any body pain just a very slight back ache which advil was helping and hours later I was crippled Its weeks now amp Im either in a wheelchair or walking around the house with a cane Horrible horrible medication i now take oxycontine every hours and oxycodone every hours Refuse this drug if you are smart Even my oncologist is quotsurprisedquot with the side effects I have I refuse to have a second injection of xgeva
5386,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,41619,30,I absolutely love this birth control pill worked great for me I had no weight gain I had regularshort period with no cramps It also helped a lot with my acne while on the pill I had no acne and very clear skin but now that Im off I wish I was still on the pill just for that reason
5387,Cryselle,Birth Control,1,41597,31,I was given this pill as a second option because I felt the other pill I was taking was causing me to gain weight I notice that with this pill I was not happy Not with the pill but my personality drastically changed I was moody irritable emotional and down right a pain to be around I have stopped taking it a week ago just to see if my mood would improve and it has I would say stay away from this pill if you are under stress as it will add to that negative side of your life
5388,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,41596,37,I am and began taking Cryselle for birth control Ive had oily skin and moderate acne since puberty Ive been using topical medicines to treat my acne for two yearsThe first month taking Cryselle I broke out horribly the week of my period Were talking the worst pimples Ive ever had the kind that throb when you bend overThe second month I had no break out I have not had a single blemish in the past months of taking Cryselle Mood swings are mild to unnoticeableEven though there may be lots of ladies with bad experiences with this birth control dont be afraid to try it Cryselle has turned out to be very good for me and cleared my skin Just be patient give it at least months before quitting
5391,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,41521,21,I recently just switched to this pill because I kept spotting and having heavy periods on the estrogen pills but I have to say this pill is working great for me so far I have little to no periods the only place I gained weight was in my breasts so thats cool and my mood has been so stable I barely PMS anymore The only negative is that I sometimes breakout on my face a little bit before my period but a few pimples over heavy bleeding and spotting in the past is no problem Great pill highly recommend it if you have heavy periods and want a lighter one
5393,Cryselle,Birth Control,8,41397,16,Ive been taking this for a while and as a fairly small lady the side effects can be a little much at times Sometimes it causes really nasty headaches behind my eyes due to my contact lenses Also I tend to get stomach pains that happen at random times throughout my cycle However it has kept my cycle very regular and reduced my period from seven days to four Great if you have irregular cycles but the side effects can be a tad overpowering if youre not prepared
5394,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,41377,17,Ive been taking Cryselle for over a year and I find it the best birth control for me Ive taken several others that made me sick and Cryselle gives me the least side effects I get moody on and off but thats normal for any woman in general Ive had less cramping and periods are normal I gained pounds but thats also something that comes with it just like either losing weight Overall I like Cryselle
5395,Cryselle,Birth Control,3,41357,31,I have been taking this pill for about months now and I thought that all the side effects it was giving me was something else so I just ignored them Until now when I finally hit it on the head and realized all my weird mood swings and everything are from this pill Im going to my doctor to switch Every day Im so depressed and want to cry all the time Ive lost interest in social activities and some days all I can do is lay in bed all day from fatigue and exhaustion over doing nothing My skin is extremely oily and my hair that was once very thick is falling out The smallest things irritate me and on my period it feels like the world is ending I have difficulties breathing dizzy spells huge cravings for junk food
5397,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,41340,11,I took Cryselle for almost a year with no problems at all The only reason I stopped is because me and my husband decided to expand our little family but Im almost positive I will get back on it after baby is born
5399,Cryselle,Birth Control,3,40977,18,I started this pill a month ago and ever since then Ive had spotting everyday bad headaches and oily skin
5400,Cryselle,Birth Control,10,40943,31,I have had a fantastic experience with Cryselle I take the pill before I go to bed every night and have never had a side effect I have been on Cryselle for months and have never gotten pregnant Prior to taking Cryselle my cycle was random and rarely hit at the same time each month but since being on the birth control my cycle is constant I highly recommend this birth control
5401,Cryselle,Birth Control,2,40929,13,I have had the worst experience with this pill My face chest and back are CONSTANTLY breaking out Ive never had this problem until my doctor switched me to Cryselle
5402,Cryselle,Birth Control,9,40864,25,I have been taking this pill for months and it has been great so far My periods are lighter and I hardly have any cramping when before they were horrible Really It has made me less moody during my periods which my boyfriend finds amazing and it has also made the sex better in our relationship Besides the slight weight gain this pill has been exceptionally good to me and will continue to take it
5405,Cryselle,Birth Control,8,40677,8,This really helped me for my period before this pill my period was so bad going on for days with serious pain for the first days I would take like ibuprofen in just hours NOT good and it wouldnt help But now my pain is mild to none and that makes me happy I was seriously hoping it would help lower my acne level though but it gave me more plus oily skin Just as long as it keeps the pain away Ill keep taking it
5406,Cryselle,Birth Control,4,40673,30,I have been on LoOvral since I was I was taking the other generic LowOgestrel up until last month The pharmacy switched generics Ever since I started taking the Cryselle I have cramps constantly and always feel bloated

5411,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,41622,9,May be influenced by sun exposure a dog kissing you on the lips a stranger kissing in the mouth a womans menstrual cycle Apply this cream every few hours and at bedtime It will hasten the healing Also applying an ice cube helps
5412,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,8,41459,15,Ive been getting cold sores for as long as I can remember Usually triggered by stress but sometimes for no reason at all Over the years Ive tried EVERYTHING Zoviraxwhatever was the new product on the market Denavir is the best topical ointment But like everyone states you must apply it as soon as possible for me by the time I feel a slight tingle its too late I was at work this time when I felt my lip tingle and literally ran home to get my Denavir I suggest you carry the small tube in your wallet as I do now I keep one at home at work and in my wallet early application makes a huge difference in duration of cold sore Its expensive but worth it One tip so as not to waste it dont squeeze
5413,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,41438,3,Feel a tingle and put it on and no symptoms Finally
5415,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,41247,9,Ive gotten cold sores since childhood years ago Ive tried many remedies Denavir is by far the best Ive ever used especially when used at the first sign of an outbreak
5416,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,41245,12,Im and have had cold sore outbreaks since I was or so They used to come only once every few years but the last years I have had outbreaks every months or so After just dealing with it without medication for most of my life I finally broke down and saw a doctor about it I was prescribed Denavir about months ago and wish I would have gotten a hold of it a LONG time ago It works great The first time I used it I already had a big blister on my lip but it helped it heal so much faster and made it much less noticeable I just recently started to have another outbreak and put Denavir on it right away I could still feel the tingle on my lip for several days but as long as I kept Denavir on it the blister never formed
5417,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,9,40939,13,I tend to get really bad cold sores when I get sick sun burned or chew my lips too much After battling the flu a big sucker popped up covering almost half of my entire bottom lip It came on a Thursday and was completely gone by that Sunday The only drawback is I still got the cluster of blisters its almost as Denavir draws out the virus and kills it fast Fastest cold sore relief I have ever used
5418,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,40753,13,This medicine is AMAZING I woke up with the tingling feeling Wednesday morning by the afternoon it started taking its course I picked up Denavir from the pharmacy that afternoon and started applying every two hours like it recommends It has kept the cold sore at an absolute minimum It hasnt even developed fully and I think its already on its way out days AMAZING Its super expensive if you dont have insurance but if you do get this
5420,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,40367,10,Ive had cold sores since I was young and this medicine is fantastic It will stop the cold sore from getting really large and it heals a lot faster Great product
5421,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,39980,11,I never seen a medicine work so fast and been so efficient with cold sores
5422,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,39770,10,I get cold sores frequently in fall and winter Denavir is wonderful When I use it at the first sign sometimes it doesnt even develop into a cold sore I always keep this on hand
5423,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,39638,13,My husband used a Denavir sample attained from our Dermatologist He did not begin use at onset but when he began Denavir the cold sore disappeared in half the normal time no side effects either We were astounded Tried to get another sample they didnt have anymore but gave my husband an Rx for it Checked with Pharmacy the cost for Denavir was exorbitant It is great stuff
5424,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,1,43021,1,Mylan now owns Denavir and they have jacked up the price to US a tube Not worth it The patent will expire in I have stop using it even though my insurance covers this for an copayI have tried taking Llysine and vitamin C during an outbreak They worked almost as wellIn the USthe overcounter Abreva works as well for me It cost at most a tubeIf you are outside of the US you can easily get generic Acyclovir for less than a tubeTry to reduce stress in your life exercise and eat well You will probably get less occurences
5426,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42963,0,Finally a medication that truly delivers on its claim Clears up cold sores within a day or two if caught early otherwise still provides relief and shortens duration This stuff works
5427,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42884,0,Ive had cold sores for as long as I can remember I always get them when Im really stressed out Ive had up to at one time At that point I finally went to my doctor who prescribed me Valtrex which doesnt do much for me I went to a dermatologist for an unrelated issue and he asked what I was taking for cold sores I had one on my lip He prescribed me Denavir and it works wonders Cuts out the pain and itching and reduces healing time drastically Luckily I have tricare so I have no copays for prescriptions I didnt know it costs so much until I read other reviews So thankful for my hubby being in the military
5428,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42839,0,I bought it yesterday for eur My blister has already gone I cannot believe it is so expensive in the US
5429,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42823,4,Denavir is the only medication Ive ever found that takes care of a cold sore as soon as you feel the tingle I just dont understand why a small tube costs almost a thousand dollars
5430,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,1,42773,7,Almost for a gram tube The owners should be ashamed Theyll get rich and hopefully be able to take all their riches to the grave
5431,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42723,3,Had cold sores on lips amp nose regularly since childhood But not in the or more years that Ive had a Denavir prescription In that time if I apply at the first tingle it rarely ever breaks through to become a sore It has been a blessing The cost is ridiculous plus with a ~ insurance copay usually Almost fainted last time I refilled as CVS listed a coupon on the receipt so I wound up paying only Do not know what that was about asked no questions I skipped out of the pharmacy quickly and enjoyed my surprise Christmas present
5432,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,7,42559,14,Penciclovir is the active ingredient and it does work to clear cold sores fasterFor those wondering why it costs in the USA amp less than in other countries the reason is because the USA has been unsuccessrful in purchasing pharmaceuticals at discounted prices The more countries that get discounts the more the USA has to pay because drug companies want to cover their losses Europes ability to buy cheap medication depends on the pharmaceutical companies assumption that the USA will pay full price plus enough to cover the discount to X country in Europe Other countries bargaining directly affects American drug prices Americans need to put pressure on politicians and insist on drug bargaining to make healthcare affordable
5433,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42470,7,this is the best solution to nasty cold sores If you are reading these reviews to get an idea about this medicine stop now and order one right now Believe everything every person is saying here about this cream It is a miracle cream on every use
5435,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42439,9,Best medicine ever Have been using it for yearstried everything else Went to pick up my RX todayCost my insurance wont pay for it anymore This is crazy
5436,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42438,6,NEVER have I used a medication for my cold sores that has been so effective Ive tried everything Denivar is amazing I have struggled with cold sores since I was about years old getting about two or three per year My doctor prescribed Denivar last month when I first felt the quottinglequot and it stopped the blister before it ever developed I have found a miracle
5437,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42436,5,I have been getting several cold sores a year and I am not lucky enough to feel that first tingle I wake up with a full blown blister Ive tried Abreva and several over the counter remedies with no luck I finally asked my Dr for something stronger and they prescribed Valtrex I had no luck with that eitherI woke up on a Monday with a huge cold sore blister and took my Valtrex as prescribed with no luck I saw my Dr again and asked for Denavir because I saw great reviews online I applied it on Thursday to a very huge and disgusting blister every hours as directed and by Sunday the cold sore was gone Normally it takes me almost full weeks to get rid of one This is truly my miracle product However it is ridiculously expansive
5438,Penciclovir,Cold Sores,10,42430,5,Denavir is truly the best cure for cold sores Heals fast and stops pain on contact I love it

5504,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42976,1,I Have had IBS for years now ago My PCP recently wrote me a script for Donnatal Elixer Unfortunately my prescription insurance is denying me this medication stating quotNonEssential MedicationRejected Not Coveredquot I want to know when my prescription insurance company received their medical degree and at what time have they ever examined me andor read through my complex medical conditionshistory To add insult to injury I also have Common Variable Immune Deficiency which is known to cause major GI complications including infections and intestinal inflammationpain I plan to appeal the denial for the Donnatal Elixer Also the intestinal cramping I suffer renders me paralyzed with pain unable to sit or walk
5510,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42335,20,Im and one of the first memories I have is me at about four reeling in pain from IBSD I have often thought about just taking the easy way out due to the constant agony Then one day an amazing gastro suggested Donnatal and within about three hours of taking it I was pain free This stuff is a life changer for me at least
5512,Donnatal,Duodenal Ulce,9,41879,11,Was given this medication as an liquid form along with a couple of other liquid medications I had to drink like a half of gallon non stop but within to minutes my Irritable Bowel Syndrome relaxed and I started flautuating like crazy in the emergency room in front of the doctor and nurse The doctor said thats what we wanted Within hour my IBS was completed gone The problem now is my doctor prescribed me Donnatal and the prescription is with insurance so now Im back suffering with IBS day after day knowing if I could just get that medication I would be fine again
5513,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,41795,53,I have used Donnatal for over years mainly for Irritable Bowel Syndrome It works every single time I have a flareup like nothing else I have ever taken Hands down the best medication in my opinion No side effects reduces sweating but that also helps me since I tend to sweat a lot It also has helped me with anxiety as well as during weaning from opiate medications GREAT MEDICINE Only con is that not all pharmacies carry it anymore
5516,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,41340,65,I am a year old male who has suffered from IBS since my teens Nothing has been successful until I went to Italy and learned about Donnatal When I returned to the States i asked my Dr about Donnatal and he said it was an old medicine which he hasnt prescribed in years He gave me a prescription and my pains and loose bowl movements have stopped I have been taking this medicine for months and now I can function normally now I have my life back I reported this to my Dr who was surprised and has started to prescribe it again with some great feedbackI find the liquid Donnatal works best I can even drink Coffee again
5517,Donnatal,Enterocolitis,10,41266,23,I had been seeing GI specialist for months for intermittent nausea and vomiting that led to horrible stomach and chest pain My GI tried everything nothing seemed to worked I even threw up on Zofran twicestrongest antinausea medicine you can get I wind up in the ER about monthly for complications with dehydration and anemia and at the ER I was put on Donnatal Donnatal was a miracle I can now function leave my house most days and no longer spend every day wishing I would just die because of the pain It doesnt fix everything but without it I am really bad

5520,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,40736,77,My GI Doctor has tried half a a dozen different drugs for my IBS and none could seem to to do the trick I pretty much gave up all hope until during my yearly physical my PCP who has been practicing years mentioned I tried a much older drug called Donnatal He told me it was an old drug but proven effective time and time again I filled the script and immediately started taking it I noticed improvement almost immediately and have been taking it regularly for months now with no complaints Donnatal is my miracle
5521,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,40722,66,It relieves my stomach pains due to severe bloating and gas It is sedating Once I take it if I am somewhere comfortable I can dose off It is a very good medicine

5525,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,40234,49,Before I took this I was suffering from constipation and diarrhea The drug helps settle my stomach I take it twice a day The pills are very small and disintegrate fast with liquid which make them extremely easy to swallow I use to dread using the bathroom before I started taking this drug Now I dont even think twice about it and my stress level has decreased dramatically
5526,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,40222,56,I have bowel adhesions and they cause debilitating IBS I first was given Donnatal Elixir in an ER with horrible intestinal cramps This stuff soothes works quickly and it stops the cramps I recommend it to anyone I know who has IBS And the drowsy side effect helps me to sleep and when I wake up I feel better Definitely ask your doctor about this one if you suffer from intestinal issues
5527,Donnatal,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,40099,61,I take Donnatal with Reglan minutes before meals and at bedtime It helps with the intestinal and stomach cramps Plus it also helps with the diarrhea It is a miracle drug and I am glad I asked my doctor about it plus the phenobarbital in the Donnatal helps my anxiety

5532,Almotriptan,Migraine,9,42621,5,I have tried a few triptans Zomig Maxalt Imitrex Axert and had the best results with Axert mg I also use a toradol nasal spray in conjunction with the triptan I suffer from chronic migraines monthI am able to function and not miss any work with Axert I am an IT executive and do not find I have any diminished capacity with AxertI am currently waiting for coverage approval to start botox units for my migraines which will hopefully eliminate my headaches Fingers crossed

5535,Almotriptan,Migraine,8,42294,4,Ive tried a few triptans but this is the first one Ive tolerated In general it is effective within an hour However in the rare case my migraine is preceded by an aura it seems less effective That said since I cant tolerate other triptans due to side effects I like this one best My insurance company doesnt like it and I needed to obtain prior authorization always a headache Use the coupon for the copay if you can
5536,Almotriptan,Migraine,9,42293,7,Had the beginning of migraine on a night shift Took tablet and within minutes I could function again with none of the stated side effects
5538,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,42057,4,I have tried many many medication to treat my severe and frequent migraines My only complaint is the price It is costprohibitive to take as needed
5539,Almotriptan,Migraine,2,42028,3,I had the side effect of being very tired and slept a lot which at least then I wasnt in pain but not convenient
5540,Almotriptan,Migraine,9,41859,5,Axert works fairly well for me Most of the time I take it with naproxen and I dont need to take it a second time I can think of any side effects that I have had with it I wish you could take more than in a week
5541,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,41857,10,Had migraine headaches throughout adolescence and survived on extra strength Advil and eventually took prescription quotEmpracetquot As an adult migraines became more severe which led to vomitting and days in bed until my doctor prescribed quotAxertquot in December Since I am able to function and proceed with my days within min of dose

5551,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,40835,15,I was on Amerge for years before a doctor gave me a new migraine prescription for Axert This has been an AMAZING solution for my migraines Its highly effective and usually works within an hour of taking a dose even if Ive had the migraine for many hours Ive even had times where it worked within minutes Its cheaper than the other migraine pills Ive taken and literally has ZERO side effects and very few drug interactions I would highly recommend trying Axert if you are a migraine sufferer
5552,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,40811,7,Best thing since slice bread Very expensive but worth it
5553,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,40687,5,Used to take Axert but then lost my insurance I never missed work or school Unfortunately things in life went south and Im living back home trying to get s new degree and have missed untold days because of migraines Finally have a primary physician and she wont prescribe it because it can cause serotonin syndrome with my antidepressant I was on antidepressants when I was on it last This is day of the May of migraines Ive either woke up with one had it hit me in the middle of the day or strike by pm EVERY DAY and now I have gastritis so I can only take Tylenol I know this is a review I love Axert
5554,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,40585,11,ONLY migraine medicine that ever worked for me and with no side effects at all It would stop a developing migraine in its tracksUnfortunately my new job does not offer insurance and a prescription of Axert without insurance is close to Very upsetting But when that day comes I will fill that prescription and no longer have day migraines
5555,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,40565,10,Only one that ever helped WHEN will it go generic
5556,Almotriptan,Migraine,10,40549,13,Axert is my miracle medicine Can sometimes take up to or hours or longer to take effect but works faster for others Works best in conjunction with TylenolAdvil Not only does it COMPLETELY relieve all migraine symptoms it also relaxes my tense muscles other triptans cause muscle spasms No unpleasant side effects only sleepiness usually if I stay active I can combat this without trouble but if I lie down Im out like a light and increased urination really I literally dont know what I would do without Axert
5557,Bonine,Vertig,9,40322,75,I have recently had several episodes of vertigo likely due to ear problems I was recommended meclizine by a doctor and it worked very well I had expected to have to go to bed but I was able to go to a friends house for dinner I did feel sleepy the next day however
5558,Bonine,Motion Sickness,9,40313,17,Works great makes me a little drowsy I would not take it if I am driving

5562,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,39909,47,We are cruisers and have been on many since My doctor at the time told me to try Bonine and it has gotten me through many a rough sea and Im always able to enjoy myself I have forgotten to take it twice and each time got motion sickness So I always recommend it to family friends and other new cruisers
5563,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,39797,48,It worked immediately I was on a cruise ship and as soon as I popped it into my mouth the vertigo and nausea disappeared for hours No drowsiness
5564,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,39761,89,I went on a day night cruise with my identical twin Both of us had previously taken Dramamine but neither of us liked it due to the sleepiness She bought some Bonine while I had my doctor write me a prescription for the backear sticker Both of us took our medicines hours before getting on our plane I got tired while she enjoyed poking me and making fun The back ear patch didnt work because I got sick with in minutes of being on the ship My sister forced me to take the patch off and made me take the Bonine We had a great trip We swear by Bonine and our family and friends love it too
5565,Bonine,Nausea/Vomiting,8,39720,38,I had nausea vomiting and dizziness due to withdrawls from medicines Taking Bonine has helped me get through the day
5566,Bonine,Vertig,10,39622,158,This drug was prescribed for me by a Doctor in for vertigoIt worked beautifully and I occasionally take it when needed yet today
5567,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,43002,3,Bonine is a game changer My husband amp I have a ft boat which my husband loves offshore fishing But I get terrible sea sickness Even if its less than a foot Tried Dramamine and it never worked I would be green in less than an hour But then I discovered Bonine quotGod Sentquot took pill The chewable amp lasted all day fishing Not too mention it was rough seas about to feet It was amazing So Im sold definitely a Bonine fan It was a game changer for me This stuff truly work
5568,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,42985,2,My sister and I have a long history of motion sickness a rocking chair or porch swing is enough to set it off for us This summer we took a trip to Jordan Israel Greece and Italy where we traveled on planes buses trains and ferries and rode in taxis rented cars and jeepsand camels and donkeys in the desertwithout any trouble at all as long as we took our Bonine every morning We cant say enough about this products efficacy
5571,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,42806,7,I have had middle ear operations Half my coclea is gone so my equilibrium is constantly off very dizzy all the time Bonine is a god send
5572,Bonine,Vertig,10,42683,48,This is great stuff Ive had vertigo for years and this works better than the prescription medicine
5573,Bonine,Motion Sickness,9,42619,16,works better on a mostly empty stomach Took bonine mg pills an hour and a half before my flight felt virtually no motion sickness on the initial flights or connections It works

5577,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,42260,24,I love to fish but would get very seasick Once I discovered Bonine I never got seasick again I take one the day before and one just before i get on the boat Works great
5581,Bonine,Vertig,10,41850,136,I have had vertigo for years now and Bonine is the only thing that helps me I have these on hand wherever I go and could not function right without them The heaviness in head and the dizziness I feel it coming on and take two and Im fine about minutes later I highly recommend Bonine for vertigo symptoms
5582,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,41535,55,On the advise of a friend my wife and I started taking Bonine hrs before we departed on a small ship cruise in the Caribbean It was the best advise we could have gotten because at night while traveling between the islands the weather was very very rough Over half the people on the cruise were extremely sea sick and miserable We felt fine and had no issues at all I highly recommend this product
5583,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,41443,54,I didnt get motion sickness until AFTER we got off our day cruise I have been fighting nausea and dizziness for a week now The doctor said it is normal to suffer this after a cruise after reading these reviews I went and bought Bonine I took one pill and I feel great Sure wish I had researched this a week ago
5584,Bonine,Motion Sickness,9,41362,42,My husband and I went on a night Bahamas cruise for a romantic getaway I get quotsea sickquot when traveling at times but was thinking big ship less motion Wrong I was sick by dinner pm and we boarded at pm I was so upset crying nauseous disappointed My husband amp I went to the gift shop amp found Bonine I took amp got very drowsy but no more sea sickness I decided the next dose I would take pill amp see if that went betterit did So for the rest Id the trip I took pill every recommended dosing time and I did not have sickness or drowsiness again Bonine was amazing for me Highly recommend it and it was worth every penny
5585,Bonine,Vertig,3,41141,54,I took Bonine tablets tabs recommended on label and felt ok was able todrive and go to places Took another one before bed and I overslept only to wake up with a heavy headedness like I was on antidepressants Did not like the feeling and did not want to go driving under these conditions
5586,Bonine,Nausea/Vomiting,10,41016,28,A friend of mine told me to take Bonine because I have horrible morning sickness Im pregnant with my third child and its an awful thing to have to chase after two kids with morning sickness It worked wonders for me I would tell everyone to at least try it
5587,Bonine,Motion Sickness,10,40813,34,Bonine is a miracle if you are bothered by motion sickness I take a caffeine pill with Bonine to combat drowsiness The combination of the two is a winner for me
5588,Bonine,Motion Sickness,1,40766,17,Bonine did not work at all for me and I really suffered during a hour flight
5590,Bonine,Motion Sickness,9,40710,29,I took it prior to leaving on a cruise and it worked very well I took it every day that we were at sea I highly recommend this medication
5591,Bonine,Motion Sickness,2,40609,16,Hated the taste of the chewable Bonine and did not help with my motion sickness
5592,Actifed,Cold Symptoms,10,42417,1,Makes me have a good nights sleep
5593,Actifed,Cold Symptoms,4,42398,3,To be honest the first time I used it I thought it was great But this time its not effective at all Still have runny nose watery eyes etc
5594,Actifed,Cold Symptoms,9,40948,5,This is my absolute favourite for colds with runny and partially blocked nose itchy and watery eyes and sneezing This antihistamine does make me drowsy a tiny bit but I can go to work as normal and dont really see any difference I tried combining some other antihistamines and phenylephrine but I keep going back to good old ActifedThe only downside it really makes my mouth and throat dry so I guess I might try taking half of the tablet instead
5595,Actifed,Cold Symptoms,8,40106,7,When used for colds Actifed works well for drying up post nasal drip that causes near constant coughing especially at night It does cause drowsiness but not a problem for night time use I can get a nearly full night of rest However with subsequent use on following nights Actifeds effectiveness lasts only half as long
5596,Actifed,Allergic Rhinitis,5,39959,6,Used to work great tab a day for allergies no side effects Lately bad side effects sleepy and unsettled
5597,Actifed,Cold Symptoms,9,39920,9,Its the best medicine for relief from cold and runny nose but I feel sleepy every time I use it
5598,Actifed,Cold Symptoms,9,39867,7,This product really helps when it comes to congestion runny nose etc Definitely recommend it for cold symptoms
5599,Actifed,Allergic Rhinitis,9,39833,9,This is the very best drug Ive found for frequent attacks of runny nose and sneezing As an antihistamine its very fast acting It can be scored in half or used whole
5603,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,7,42781,6,I was told this drug would fix my symptoms in months but I had to take it for almost years and my hormone levels fluctuated greatly over that time
5604,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,10,42682,10,Before I was using parlodel which is the same medicine for reducing prolactin My prolactin is and facing irregular periods Previously I faced horrible side effects but with dostinex I am very happy no side effects just feel sleepy some time
5605,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,4,42499,10,Avoid this drug at all costs I took it to bring down my prolactin levels which it did but I had some extreme side effects Severe depression fatigue lack of motivation just to name a few
5606,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,10,42463,17,I have been taking dostinexcabergoline for years The main constant side effect is headaches It feels like an ice pick is stabbing me in my head for a couple of seconds and then it goes away just as quickly as it started It only happens maybe a couple times a month I also find I get tired more easily and sometimes need to rest during the day in addition my vision has worsened I stopped the medicine for about a year now and Im getting dizzy quite often lately and my vision is worse I fear my tumor has grown and need to see my endocrinologist again God bless all
5607,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,10,42155,21,This drug reduced my prolactin levels really quick I did not have a visible prolactinoma on my MRI but my doctor suspected it was really small After months my prolactin levels decreased from to In the first month I felt a bit dizzy and wanted to sleep a lot more than usual I had a few cat naps which is heaps out of character for me I never usually sleep during the day This went away after about month and I generally feel fine taking Dostinex Ive been taking it for about months now I recommend you give it a go
5608,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,10,41591,28,Ive been taking Cabergoline for years and it has helped keep my prolactin level normal I can take it anytime of the day and it doesnt bother my stomach i do get dizzy easier on this medicine
5609,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,10,40407,67,Ive used Dostinex for years now to treat high prolactin hormone levels When I was younger they had me take Propranolol which made me so sick to my stomach Dostinex has really no side effects that Ive experienced and I only have to take it twice a week
5610,Dostinex,Hyperprolactinemia,8,39519,20,good drug for dysreflexy in spinal cord injurieds
5612,Aldactone,Acne,10,41676,140,I have been taking Aldactone for adult hormonal acne for almost years and I cannot even put into words the HUGE difference it has made In my early s I began getting horrible cystic acne all over my chin and entire jaw line area I had used every product available including Proactive expensive designer dept store lines RetinA birth controls etcNOTHING helped Id have painful nodules at once each lasting weeks and most scaring My selfesteem was ruined I was ashamed Finally at age I went to a dermatologist and started on Aldactone mgday I saw noticeable improvement within a week and was totally clear in one month Increased to mgday after months and have had flawless skin since Truly a LIFESAVER medicine
5613,Aldactone,Edema,9,41672,37,No side effects and a lot easier to my metabolism than Lasix
5614,Aldactone,Acne,10,41458,45,I began this Aldactone mg weeks ago days later I had a Cyst rupture on my Ovary I had a partial Hysterectomy mths ago Not certain if the medicines were a part that will have to wait to be seen I immediately felt the oil dry and the cyst go away One of the best is I feel like the redness is gone as well I love that since th grade till my th year years of Accutane a million times odd antibiotics birth control topicals and I FINALLY FEEL FREE of my ugly red skin
5616,Aldactone,Acne,10,41163,56,Great Works wonders for oily skin and hormonal acne A bonus is that it helped make me lbs lighter
5617,Aldactone,Heart Failure,1,40992,99,Didnt work for me Muscle aches itch and most importantly it dropped my blood pressure too low along with the other medication I am takingpressure was normally I am I was exhausted tired weak and constantly falling asleep This medication was not for me Called doctor he told me to stop taking it and this was at pill dosage
5619,Aldactone,High Blood Pressure,2,40878,119,I took this medication for four years all the while becoming less and less interested in sex and unable to achieve an erection Having gone through cardiologists not a one of them ever informed me that Aldactone is an antiandrogen which blocks muscle and bodily binding of testosterone necessary for it to take effect and also lowers production of testosterone itself I had to happen upon it on my own The day I found out is the day I stopped taking it Giving a male a medicine which renders his testosterone ineffectual may be good for those undergoing a sex change but not for those who are not There is another potassium sparing drug like Aldactone without the sexual side effects but it is more expensive
5620,Aldactone,Edema,9,40705,41,It has less side effects than other medications
5621,Aldactone,High Blood Pressure,1,40640,89,This medicine did lower my blood pressure but after being on it for about months I began to have trouble urinating At first I thought I was getting a bladder infection but the symptoms would come and go Mainly occurring right after I took the pill I decided to stop taking it for a while to see if the symptoms went away and they did I also had swelling of my hands and I gained pounds
5622,Aldactone,Alopecia,9,40557,133,It has help me to grow hair back on my head and assist in breast growth
5624,Aldactone,Acne,9,40087,141,Being almost and having cystic acne I began taking this as a last result I tried all skin care linesfound myself using Clarins and my skin improved but still I was oily and breaking out on my neck and cheeks After a couple of weeks I noticed I wasnt waking up with what seemed like a thick layer of oil on my face I began to break out less and less My Dermatologist upped my dose and now my painful cystic acne is gone and my skin feels great Although I find myself very parched at times and you must watch your salt and alcohol intake I like this medication
5625,Aldactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,9,40058,46,The effect on blood pressure normalization is almost magic However after many years of use the drop in testosterone has been significant The drop in libido and desire caused a relationship to fail and the low testosterone aggravated a weight gain problem By utilizing topical testosterone supplements libido is much improved and weight loss is possible again
5626,Aldactone,High Blood Pressure,10,39740,180,This medicine treated highblood pressure water retention acne femalemale pattern hairloss excessive unwanted facial hair and is a potassium sparing medicine It is ideal for sufferers of insulin resistance or pcos Although it hasnt completely stopped the unwanted hair growth it has been the only thing that has made a significant difference by slowing it down drastically It has also slowed the hairloss down significantly in which I am very pleased with
5628,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,7,42767,11,I truly believe it works at stopping leakage I thought I had found a miracle cure but I seem to be allergic and cant take the burning redness and rash I have gone through a couple of boxes because it works so well but six days after only a hour use I still have a terrible itchy red rash I will still consider using for special occasions And I must agree it is expensive
5629,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,42736,33,This is my first day of using OxytrolAmazing there is no comparison in the differenceI have not had urgency leakage or inability to controlI will continue to buy this product I tried Azoand it did not help at allI am more than pleased with the Oxytrol
5630,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,1,42720,10,Didnt work at all
5631,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,9,42680,35,Okay Ive been using this for a few months now and its changed everything for me It started working right away for me I went to dinner with friends on the second night I had this on and didnt have to go to the restroom once Then I walked around a park for awhile with no urge I got home before I even had to pee AND I DRANK BOTH WATER AND COLA at the restaurantI notice it starts to lose its effectiveness over time sometimes well before the days Not sure if thats because of the chosen locations or what Now and then I take a week long break altogether Then try again and it works again I guess I build up resistance over time and it needs to be reset I use a waterproof bandage adhesive over top the patch to keep it on
5634,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,8,42577,24,These definintely work Day one I saw relief with the gotta go right now feeling frequency and leakage The downside is the patches rarely last four days usually hours to hours which makes them very expensive They are itchy and cause redness where the patch is placed The edges collect lint from your clothes which make the patch look dirty They constantly get caught on your clothing and pull your skin As they dry up they begin to sound quotcrinklyquot which could be embarrassing The drying up can occur as soon as hours They are also not clear and discreet The background is clear but there are logos printed across each patch Very sexy
5635,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,5,42558,13,Works but I have the lining of the patch still and it looks like a scar Its been weeks and it still hasnt gone away
5636,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,10,42508,33,I have overactive bladder amp Incontinence really bad for being in my late s I never thought a single patch for hours could even function for my disfunctional bladder I put it on for the first time after I showered before bed waking up I didnt feel as full and didnt have to rush to the bathroom During the day no leakage at all when I walk and no urge I feel normal again All I know whoever invented this is genius cause it is so nice to not wear pads but please just reduce the price a bit
5637,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,9,42432,60,Great product I have been on other drugs that gave me back side effectsrash itching dry mouth constipation headache dizziness back pain etc I urinate on average times a day every approx minutes after using the patch I went as long as hours without using restroom my skin is irritated and red but better than spending my whole day in the bathroom I cant believe my doctor didnt put me on this over the counter drug first before spending hundreds of dollars on prescription medications I have suffered for over yrs with the issue of urgency and frequency this is a miracle for me Praise the LORD
5640,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,42299,31,Oxytrol gave me a life without looking for the closest bathroom in s panic I can now control my urge long enough to get to a bathroom Only problem is its hard to find No longer on shelves at stores
5643,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,10,42267,36,When the urge hit I had to go right then I was a slave to pads Not very sexy I had an innerstem put in but it did not help The mess prescribed did not work either The only thing that literally freed me from pads is the patch I did not have dry mouth I can wait to go potty for hour or longer now
5644,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,7,42240,23,I think the patch worked better for me in the beginning Less effective now As far as the sticking I found it works best on my lower back area You have to make sure there is no lotion or soap where you apply and then hold your hand over the patch for at least sec to make sure it adheres The heat of your hand activiates the adhesive Didnt work on my abdomen caused severe itching but not on my backside My local Walmart is out of stock I am going to try eBay
5645,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,7,42149,29,Ive been on the patch for almost hours now the only issue i am having is bad stomach cramps along with diarrhea so hopefully that stops in the next few days I dont want to get my hopes up just yet but I have noticed that the urgency amp frequency has decreased for me
5648,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,9,41933,38,I really love this product I dont have the irritation from the patch like some people are having I did find out that if you have a problem with the patch not sticking clean the area with rubbing alcohol before placing the patch and that helps it to stick just fine Maybe that would also help the ones with the irritation as well Worth a try anyway A little crinkling noise is worth dealing with compared to dealing with overactive bladder Another small issue is I feel that one patch is not as effective
5649,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,41906,70,For me it took two patches but on the fifth day they really started working I am and have had trouble with overactive bladder for the past ten years off and on It gets worse depending on what I ingest food and medication wise I am now in the bathroom every couple of hours instead of every half hour and always feeling the urge like I was Its wonderful Thanks for this product
5650,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,41863,55,All my life Ive had to deal with have an overactive bladder it made me to the point where I was and still wetting the bad at night as well as leaking throughout the day When I first tried this I saw a huge difference I havent had any of those problems except for when I keep it on longer than I should At first my skin was a little irritated by the patch but now its nothing and easy to take off I spent day without it on and it really showed me how important it is for me to have it I felt dirty through out the day and had to pee all the time like always I am so thankful for this patch it really has helped live with having an over active bladder
5653,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,6,41658,51,The patch worked However the itching and inflamed skin was not tolerable I wish I could bear it just to be relieved of the overactive bladder I thought I would have a normal life Now trying Toviaz
5654,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,7,41650,102,I have over active bladder and uncontrolable go I bought Oxytrol over the counter two days after it became available without a prescription It works so great immediately and is just amazing A real miracle They do have to do something to improve the patch I move it around to avoid the red irritation It doesnt stay on well Its too crinkley and doesnt stick well It comes loose when I bend when my clothes rub and in the shower It needs to be softer like a blister bandaid or even plain old bandaid a more rubber or fabric type patch I love it but it feels like a waste of money when it wont stay on I would give it a if it was softer and stayed on
5656,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,5,41641,52,I get bad reaction to the adhesive The redness stays for weeks and itches so bad I clean the area with acetone to remove the adhesive residue and then clean it with alcohol Hope you guys will create one for sensitive adhesive like sensitive bandage The product helps with overactive bladder I just hope the itch and redness will go away Been using this patch for a month
5657,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,8,41611,68,I am years old and dealing with a couple types of incontinence Before I talked to my doctor about it I came across these in my grocery store I bought them on a whim and tried them out It works really well no more leaking or stress incontinence Within hours I was no longer running to the bathroom The only side effect I have is some constipation A change in diet and laxatives seem to help The patch is rather uncomfortable at times but Im still experimenting with placement I change it every or days because the adhesive comes off after a while usually in the shower Id like to see a better material but Im content for now Its a lot better than taking a pill every day
5658,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,41609,60,I LOVE THIS IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE everywhere Remember everyone is different so it may not help some and it may help some but as for me it does work
5659,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,41608,85,After seeing a commercial for Oxytrol I knew I had to give it a shot I have had numerous occurances that if I had not been wearing a Depends I would have had a very embarrassing situationI noticed a difference the very FIRST day No sudden urges and no accidents or NEAR accidents I have gotten my life back I want to shout it from the rooftops Very very happy with this product So thankful it is now over the counterI have read reviews about people saying the patch left adhesive residue Ive had no such problem Also have not had it come off in the shower or pool I think it might be improved if the patch were a bit rubbery say something along the lines of a blister band aide
5660,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,7,41589,63,Been wearing the patches for a week now I can tell a difference The urge to use the bathroom greatly decreased So glad they are OTC The only problem i have is when I remove the patch it leaves adhesive on the skin its hard to get off And waterproof would be better Maybe they will update them sooner or later But def recommended
5662,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,10,41579,78,The oxytrol patch is a life changer for me I was up to the highest poise product short of a brief and keeping extra clothes at work I am I woke up the first morning after applying the patch the evening before and knew this was the answer for me I was able to calmly WALK to the bathroom only feeling a slight bladder fullness and not the desperate its to late urgency All day now I can walk calmly to the bathroom and only feel the slight bladder fullness when needing to go i cant remember feeling this way in a long long time I have not had a single leak or urgency feeling while wearing the patch Thank you Thank you Thank you
5663,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,2,41577,58,I used patches in days because each morning when I got in the shower the patch came off That was a cost of a day since I had paid for the box I called Merck manufactures product and was told they would send me a coupon or another box of patches That was weeks ago and nothing yet But I have decided not to use the product or recommend it to anyone
5664,Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,10,41575,50,Never took medication for this problem Relied on Depends So far no side effects I am on my th patch Just hope they continue to work
5665,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,1,41572,38,This patch sucks Its a complete waste of money It doesnt do anything Waste of money
5667,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,5,41567,41,Drug works but the patch is horrible It is plastic and wrinkles up The edges dont adhere well so the patch is always sticking to my clothes I hope they fix this issue If they do I will buy again but for now Im going to save my money
5668,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,7,41563,57,I had a sling a few years ago for stress incontinence that I have had since I was a kid but it didnt do anything for the overactive bladder obviously I tried the patch and within hours there was a huge difference However the patch does not stick well The adhesive on the edges of the patch is not good While it does not come off it does crinkle and wrinkle and one was clearly not adhering much at all and I doubt much medicine was delivered which was why it did not work that day The medicine is great but they need to improve the actual patch
5670,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,41550,81,I have had the patch on for hours dont even know it is there I CANNOT believe its effectiveness The CONSTANT urge to urinate is GONE I have NO feeling that I will have an accident and I DONT have to visit the bathroom constantly to make sure my bladder is empty My bladder actually feels CALM All other methods I have tried were failures right from the onset of use
5673,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,41525,66,What a difference the Oxytrol patch has made in my life I was having to go to the bathroom to times in an afternoon Since using the patches I only go about times I have had no side effects
5674,Oxytrol,Overactive Bladde,10,41401,70,I was worried the patch would be intrusive but once I put it on the only thing I noticed was my reduced need to go to the bathroom I didnt experience any other side effects

5814,Opana,Pain,9,40273,13,My doctor recently sent me to a pain management doctor to help control pain while recovering from my third knee surgery Unfortunately there will probably be a fourth surgery in the next months for a complete replacement I had constant pain while relaxing on the couch and extreme pain while walking which caused other pain in my whole body due to not being able to walk correctly My doctor had me on Tramadol mg times a day which didnt take the pain away it only took the edge off but did nothing for the extreme walking pain My new pain doctor prescribed Opana ER mg twice a day Tramadol mg pills times a day as needed and Neurontin for nighttime burning pain Only side effect is slight morning headache Opana ER is awesome
5815,Opana,Pain,9,40201,17,I have been on Opana about three weeks now for severe chronic pain I used to be on mg of OxyContin and I took the first dose prior to getting ready to leave for work after that I would spend the next minutes vomiting Opana doesnt do that to me in a mg dose and I find the pain relief much more lasting and comfortable The only medicine I ever took better than Opana for chronic pain relief was the once a day now defunct Pallodan
5816,Opana,Pain,10,40151,14,Had my left eye destroyed by a broomstick in a fight Doctor gave me percocet What a joke I was still in agony And Opana ER did the trick
5817,Opana,Pain,7,40131,76,Currently taking x mg ER and up to x mg IR Tolerance has developed quickly what used to take the pain away only half way dulls it now My doctor is not convinced of my pain I have asked for more but he without coming right out and saying no has refused me increased dosage My advice is even though Opana works well initially you will develop tolerance rapidly and require more in order to provide pain relief I do have several bulging discs but for some reason my doctor does not see this as cause to increase the dose only continue the same dose that I began with about months ago Sorry for the rant but it may be something you might have not considered if I had not brought it up From what I have gathered from independent research of Opana and Oxycodone Opana has the greatest tolerance increase potential between the two
5818,Opana,Pain,6,40111,16,I was taking fentanyl and they put me on Opana and I felt it might have worked okay for a little while but I went back on fentanyl a few months later
5819,Opana,Pain,1,40082,12,Still in pain
5821,Opana,Pain,7,40069,31,Opana workes for a while for me but after a couple of weeks it just stops helping
5822,Opana,Pain,8,40068,56,Opana has worked better than anything I have been prescribed I have several bulging discs in the lower back and mid back I was taking milligrams of Vicodin daily to x mg tabs Now I take milligram Opana daily and only or Vicodin as needed Be sure to take Opana on an empty stomach and dont eat for about hours Opana is incredible my next Doctors visit I will request a slightly higher dose and quit the Vicodin all together Thank you Opana
5824,Opana,Pain,8,40055,41,I have been on Opana mg ER for almost a year now I changed to Opana as my insurance would no longer cover the Oxycontin It took my doctor almost months to figure out a dose that was acceptable to me Aside from occasional head sweats I like the Opana a lot Every once in a while I experience night terrors but do not know if they are related to the Opana or not As far as my pain is concerned they seem to do the job well and I do not get the side effects that I got with the Oxycontin
5829,Opana,Pain,9,39989,11,It works but I would like to try the extended release tablets as I feel they may be more effective
5830,Opana,Pain,9,39975,36,I am permanently disabled due to brain surgery leaving me with a condition called occipital neuralgia headaches Opana is a wonder drug for me I tried every single other treatment I could find from physical cures psychological cures to every other narcotic available It is now time for me to get off of the drug because my body has finally become used to this pain enough where I hope that I do not need drugs for the rest of my life Right now I am taking Opana mg ER X mg ER and Opana mg X mg per day My total Opana consumption daily is mg I just finally got up enough guts to ask my doctor to cut my dosage back so I am going to try to cut the Opana mg ER down to Opana mg ER X mg ER
5831,Opana,Pain,9,39968,16,Works great for pain without too many side effects
5833,Opana,Pain,10,41385,80,My experience with Opana was great It really gave me back at least After Failed back surgeries on my disc low back along with both knees which my knee surgeries were helpful I also broke my back at same time along with my neck injury which I was diagnosed with a extreme strain of my neck Which my doctor gave me a chance of success so I decided not to have and live with the pain Although when Purdue pharmaceuticals decided to completely change the formula when making the mg Opana my life changed for the worst I havent been the same since Believe me because I have tried every medicine on the market since
5834,Opana,Pain,9,41369,88,Crushed and bulged discs in cervical region but I refuse to have spinal fusion due to mixed results and incredibly invasive surgery Was on mg Oxycontins with x mgs oxycodone I cant take anything with NSAIDs in it because I had Hepatitis C which is gone after months of interferon and another medicine The oxy combo was working fine until suddenly it became impossible to get the scripts filled Pain management doctor switched me to mg ERs a day and three Opana mg IRs a day and I have no side effects works great
5835,Opana,Pain,10,41287,79,Been taking Opana for about years now Its the best medicine I have ever taken I folded up my neck in an ATV accident Have a failed level fusion with steel plate and bolts quot discs removed Also have deteriorated disc and two more spinal surgeries since first one I have had to increase my dose to a mg every hours or so and up to IR mg each day Since the pink IRs have been off the market the white generic IRs are not the same Take this on an empty stomach for best results And to the one patient in a previous comment who was trying to get his nerve up to ask the doc to reduce his dosage I would say it was really in his own hands Reduce it yourself if you really think you dont need it
5836,Opana,Pain,9,41252,117,I have cervical stenosis bulging discs and neuro issues resulting from them I have been on Fentanyl patches Oxycodone and huge doses of Morphone ER wtih IR for break through I thought my pain would never end and it was not only debilitating but depressing to the point of although not suicide definitely not wanting to get up in the morning and wishing I could just die When I moved and got a new Pain Management doctor he questioned many of my old docs decisions but above all he changed me onto Opana mg ER twice daily with mg IR Morphine for breakthrough x day I feel more alive than I have felt in at least seven years I am awake I am alert and I am functional which is more than I had come to expect Zero side effects
5837,Opana,Pain,1,41224,50,I took ONE dose of mg of Opana ER I became dizzy woozy lightheaded I developed a POUNDING headache I became EXTREMELY agitated and anxious I became VERY shaky My lower back pain INCREASED not decreased Seven hours after taking this one dose I had projectile vomiting
5839,Opana,Pain,9,40959,83,I have had severe Headaches for years due to a condition I have called Occipital Nueralgia I have tried every kind of pain medicine and preventative medicine out there NOTHING WORKED I am on mg of Opana xday and it is wonderful I can function and work and play with my kids and be out in the sun for the first time in yrs this totally keeps my pain under control I love it I highly suggest that any one with chronic severe pain try it IT WORKS
5840,Opana,Pain,10,40944,58,I have been on various medications for years some have been Lortab nonnarcotic pain medications Mscontin Oxycontin and fentanyl patches I was on micrograms of fentanyl hours before switching to Opana ER Initially I was taking mg of Opana xday and it was not sufficient for my pain but I couldnt handle the sideeffects of the fentanyl patches narcolepsy so I worked with my doctor to increase my dosage and frequency so that I now take mg xday and mg xday It is expensive but I am finally able to live a nearnormal life I play with my kids I dont miss work and I even keep the house up with great help from my better half Opana ER has been great for pain relief with almost no sideeffects
5841,Opana,Pain,9,40939,51,I have neck and back pain requiring fusion surgery already had two laser procedures on them Only thing I havent taken is fentanyl Started with a morphine Avinza Dilaudid combination to Dilaudid and oxycodone combination to straight up x Mg roxicodones and Xanax daily Pain relief with that was amazing and cheap However with that being said I asked my doctor about switching Since I was on such strong medicines I was able to get x Mg Opana ER daily along with Opana IR Have been on this four months now and is the best relief I have had in five years
5843,Opana,Pain,9,40934,28,I was currently taking Exalgo mg daily and mg Dilaudid daily It started not to work so my doctor put me on Opana mg daily and kept my Dilaudid So far taking Opana is great it last long enough to take my second dose and I couldnt be happier
5844,Opana,Pain,10,40920,41,I was taking the mg OPs for a little over a year I was on the regular oxycodone before the changethey were making me extremely nauseous at times violent vomiting and dry heaving It started with the nausea immediately and then it seemed like every months I would have a bout of nausea vomiting and dry heaving that would last for days I was in the hospital times this past year I am taking Opana now I have been on it almost a month and guess what No more of the daily nausea and worse again Doing well on Opana Wish I could have gotten it sooner My insurance would not pay for it at first but now they do Good Luck Everyone
5846,Opana,Pain,9,40767,13,If I could have afford it I would still be on it Since I suffer from Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction Hepatic region my Doctor felt that this medicine would really help since it is already broken down causing a major decrease in possible liver damage from daily major pain relief It worked really well but it would have been way over a month
5847,Opana,Pain,8,40736,41,Been on Opana now for roughly years Stool movement is difficult and most of the time you feel bloated With that being said pain is not problem with current medication x mg ER Morning Night with x mg IR for break through pain I have L S area problems Sweats are also difficult at times in heat
5848,Opana,Pain,8,40710,26,Just started taking mg twice a day Doesnt seem to last as long as the doctor said it would Also the mg doesnt take the pain away It does ease it a little So on my next visit I will tell the doctor her calculation was off Think I would do better on mg twice daily Also if she could give me something else to advance my stool and make it softer That pain is worse than the knee pain
5849,Opana,Pain,8,40596,21,I have been on a lot of narcotics since my injury and this one seems to be one of the best
5851,Opana,Pain,10,40558,37,I have to say the IRs work much better than the ERs for me I take mgs per day I used to be on many other things for pain such as OC s and MS s but the roller coaster leveled right out as soon as I started the Opana and the pain leveled also Everyone is different and everyones pain is different so suggesting a certain pill is hard for me to do Hope if you are given these best of luck with your pain as they worked for me
5852,Opana,Pain,9,40546,22,Seems to be working okay The buzz is calming after taking for weeks Ill not take morning dose if I have to function during the day Does help with chronic backcervicalknee pain Side effects are easier than Morphine That made me irritable and didnt touch the pain
5853,Opana,Pain,8,40536,17,No side effects
5854,Opana,Pain,9,40484,43,I have found Opana ER to be a lifesaver for me in that though the pain is not gone but at least it is tolerable What works for me presently is a mg dose x day along with Neurontin Taking the Opana x day takes care of it possibly wearing off earlier than it should by giving me the medicinal coverage and avoiding the need for breakthrough medications I intially was taking mg x day with the Neurontin and between my doctor pharmacist and me this protocol works much better and Medicare will cover it It was a long difficult journey to get to this point of reasonable comfort which is governed by activity levels and the weather I do not cry so much any more from the pain levels I have from a myriad of medical disabilities
5857,Opana,Pain,8,40379,73,Doctor had me on mg morphine er x a day the side effects were really bad He put me on Opana ER mg x a day and Opana IR mg for break through pain its the best pain med ever been on I have spinal stenosis degenerative disc disease osteoarthritis Was in terrible pain before Opana now at least I can stand to be alive again
5858,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,7,39869,32,The drug has been consistently effective for me at mcg I find the provided injector is much more difficult to use for a lowpain injection than the one provided with Caverject
5860,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,8,39761,34,Had good luck with it Wish I could still get it Told it is not avaialable
5862,Flecainide,Supraventricular Tachycardia,4,43061,0,I have been on Tambacor for years now and in the past years I have been having dizzy spells almost blackout panic attacks for no reason breathing problems out of the blue eyes are blurring up more and more each year no energy weak muscles and not for lack of trying I just cant get them to tone up so I consider myself weak My tummy gets upset ringing in the ears and the most annoying other than the dizziness is the low blood pressure it just drops so times These are all symptoms for this drug I was in denial for a long time as these side effects were minimal and just became worse Im not on any other drug Ill have to go off it but whats next
5863,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,43033,0,I have been on Flecainide for months It has totally eliminated my PSVT I am on mg twice a day I have not noticed any side effects I wonder if I should go through with the planned ablation
5864,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1,43001,9,After ER episode for atrial fib which I believe was onetime stressinduced issue I was bullied into taking this med by hospital upon discharge My job as a knowledge worker requires me to think for a living Im considered an expert in my fieldThis damn drug put me in a mental fog to the point that I stared at the computer screen wondering what I was looking atMy mood became aggressive depressed and I felt increasingly isolated listless tired but hard to sleepI gained about lb with no change in diet in fact I probably ate less I lost desire for my usual workout routine After weaning off after months and now taking only daily aspirin Im back to my happy self focussed and motivatedThis is a bad drug IMO
5866,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,8,42877,15,A Fib diagnoses after years of dizziness and feeling quotoddquototherwise fit and healthy Cardio versions and catheter ablations under my belt now First Doc prescribed cardio version and Amiodorone horrible side effects Went to a Cardiologist that specializes in A Fib Tried two ablations Effective for a awhile but after last cardio version prescribed Flecainide Still get breakthroughs for short durations but the strange feelings and emotional drain after incidences are the most debilitating I just take a Klonopin and a nap mg twice a day every hours year old Female
5867,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,42865,28,Benign artrial fibrillation Cardiologist tried everything next step was surgery Was having from six hour episodes per month and ruining quality of life Have been on flecainide for years and it is now completely under control Only episodes Ive had were a year ago during a bronchitis episode but as soon as antibiotics kicked in the afib was gone again Absolutely no side effects and this medicine has changed my life
5868,Flecainide,Supraventricular Tachycardia,8,42848,7,Following a knee replacement over two years ago I developed SVTa runner for years I couldnt believe I had any issue with my heart Hypertension mainly due to heredity but that is about all I can complain about I lived with the problem for a year until when my doctor put me on metoprololthis stuff was terrible My heart rate would drop to below or go higher than Again I lived with this medication for a year until I thought about cardiac ablation Before considering this method my NEW Doctor prescribed flecainide This was a game changer for me Though I still have a quotskipquot I am functional and have much more energy and overall better wellness than I had not had for years
5869,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,8,42818,17,Flecainide has controlled the afib but I have a constantly cold nose and my mouth feels like Ive had lidocaine sprayed like before dental work Some days its worse than other days I take mg twice a day with mg metropolol After two cardioversions Im willing to give flecainide a chance Ive been taking it for six months and hope the side effects dont get worse with time
5870,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,6,42775,15,Drug was great for one year Today afib pops up much more frequently
5871,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,1,42774,5,I was put on Flecainide several months ago Side effects were fatigue and dizziness Effects were interfering with my life had to pull over if driving and my commute to work is at least and hour each way Fatigue was robbing me of being able to enjoy activities I have stopped taking and am looking into other treatment options
5873,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,42720,36,Ive been on Flecainide for about months Before I was having Afib everyday usually at night for over a year And even after taking other medications prior to Flecainide it would take several hours before the Afib would go away It was a terrible existence Since taking Flecainide I have had NO Afib This to me has been remarkable The side effects for me are mainly tiredness for a couple of hours after taking it It might give me constipation but I really think that diet plays a greater role Eating more fiber and veggies and less meat is better for me I have been taking Flecainide once in the early afternoon and then once usually an hour before bedtime each time with mg I wonder if I can stop taking it in the future
5874,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,42656,22,No side effects Keeps my afib in check I have to stay cool or I can go into Afib I take mg twice a day
5875,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,5,42650,44,Three months ago because of paroxysmal afib and after wearing an event monitor I was put on both Flecainide mg twice per day and Metoprolol mg at night The original dose was Flecainide mg twice per day but when I told the cardiologist that I didnt like the way it made me feel he immediately said quotWell OK just take half the amount each timequot as though the difference wasnt a big deal The Flecainide seems to be working but instead of feeling better I am feeling progressively worse by the day Not sure whether Flecainide is to blame or the Metoprolol Feel Im in a dream most of the time excessive daytime sleepiness slight dizziness memory problems depression Hard to get hold of cardiologist
5877,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1,42579,43,Beware of this drug My mother was put on this drug in addition to diltiazem It sucked all the life out of her She got tremors couldnt walk meters without catching a breath Major fatigue and weight gain If youre sensitive to meds do not use this drug She will stop this drug today
5878,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,42569,28,afters years of Sotalol and many AF attacks Flecanide has been a wonder drug for me I get tired but dont blame flecanide thats to easy many things cause tiredness
5879,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,42564,27,I had the first afib experience in age while playing senior softball took shock paddles to convert Kept playing sports and had second episode in converted with Amiodarone Stayed on that until new doctor insurance changed took me off without a replacement reocurrence couple months later restarted on Amiodarone for conversion Back with original doctor kept up Amiodarone and all the blood work xrays pulmonaryfunction tests etc required semiannual till Finally after more tests was switched to mg Flecanide amp mg Metoprolol twice daily with no semiannual testsSo farso good except for some arthritis issues still active in sports senior Hopefullythis will stay with me
5883,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1,42319,37,This medication Flecainide was prescribed as well as Cardizem CD for chronic AFib although nothing was found wrong with my heart electrical or plumbing Serious side effects occurred and I stopped taking them took me three months to recover from the meds Did my own research and learned that Fosamax was actually responsible for my AFib The Doctors at the Heart Hospital didnt have a clue Has been four years now and no AFib and absolutely no meds This was a nightmare experience Female years old
5884,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,8,42306,74,I dont ever like taking new medicines especially those that can have severe side effects I started taking Flecainide mg x a day on October th as my paroxysmal atrial fib was getting more and more common Before this year I would get afib once a month Then it started happening a few times a week sometimes more My cardiologist prescribed Flecainide because the afib was affecting my quality of life So far it is definitely working to keep my heart in rythym No abnormalities that I know of However I do have a slight headache most of the time and feel fatigued a lot and sometimes feel a little like I am not taking a full breath I am trying to see if these symptoms subside
5885,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,42283,30,I started having A Fib in after trips to the hospital my Dr put me on Flecainide mg twice a day and mg of metoprolol I have not had a single episode until days ago I went to my cardioigist this morning and he told me to take mg of Flecainide tonight and if that did not get me back into normal rythem I will have a cardioversion days from now
5886,Opana,Pain,10,39965,16,Awesome for pain
5887,Opana,Pain,9,39925,57,I have Lupus arthritis and had most of my back crushed in a auto accident Opana is the ONLY pain medication that has relieved a majority of my pain throughout the day I take mg every hours and I am able to walk around and do things I couldnt do before when I was on the patches and all the other drugs I tried Opana is the best long term medication that keeps working without fail for me
5888,Opana,Pain,9,39908,57,This medicine has been very effective however it doesnt last the full hours of pain relief as it is prescribed For me it lasts about hours I did get horrible constipation so stay hydrated Never flush unused drugs down the toilet It can severely effect fish and other animals along the watershed Water treatment plants do not treat for disposed drugs
5889,Opana,Pain,10,39766,47,Opana is the only thing that can help me sleep through the night when I have serious pain
5890,Opana,Pain,5,39760,36,Made me feel like I had flu like symptoms
5891,Opana,Pain,10,39709,89,Before Opana I was taking mg Morphine x daily for my lower back pain from a bulging disc at LS The pain relief from the Opana is better than any other pain medication that I have tried
5893,Opana,Pain,10,39647,114,This is one of the best drugs I have taken I am able to do things I need to do I can walk and clean house Before taking Opana all I could do was lay on the couch I have rheumatoid arthritis fibromyalgia and Hepatitis C This is the only drug that has ever helped me
5896,Opana,Pain,10,39555,156,This is a wonderful pain pill I tore my sacroiliac and could barely walk because of the pain I have a high tolerance for pain medications and have tried pretty much everything and this one surpassed everything I tried and I had no side effects
5897,Opana,Pain,8,39505,59,Been on fentanyl patches for years now Wear mcg patches Recently started on Opana er mg twice a day and only wearing patch changed every hours Pain level has gone up slightly but also side effects from the patch have decreased which to me for now is a acceptable trade off Breakthrough pain occurs sooner but have not tried the higher dosage yet Have somewhat raised expectations to come off patches by end of the year
5900,Opana,Pain,10,42835,21,I have been on Opana Er mg x a day for over a year now for chronic back pain It is wonderful Nothing has ever worked for me like it has Not fentanyl patches not oxys nothing I suggest any of you have a genetic test done by your pain doctor I did It allows your doctor to be able to tell what pain meds work for you the best It isnt always about what med is the strongest its about what your body will use
5901,Opana,Pain,9,42805,22,Has been a life saver to me I have a very long history with trauma and has caused me a lifetime of serious pain CRPS FIBROMYALGIA PTSD All my doctors had said the pain was quotin my headquot and hearing someone who SHOULD understand that you can have unimaginable pain due to trauma combined with other Neurological amp Psychiatric issues Thanks to my Psychiatrist for prescribing this for meIts helped with my depression anxiety and insomnia as well My doctor and I have an incredible bondA bond that has taken years decades to build the most respected form of TRUST I DO NOT MESS WITH NOR USE MY MEDICATIONS FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IM PRESCRIBED I keep my RXs to myself amp hidden well Do Not Mess with medicine NOT INTENDED FOR RECREATIONAL USE EVER
5902,Opana,Pain,4,42774,8,Im going to be very much to the point I had a physician that retired I began seeing a new physician after searching for a physician I was comfortable with I was continued being prescribed oxycodone ER mg tab x a day with mg hydromorphone with each dose The Physician referred me to pain management pain management change meds two mg oxycodone ER that is one mg amp one mg amp mg oxycodone x day amp mg hydromorphone every hrs with each dose Then pain management switch me to oxymorphone mg every hours amp mg hydromorphone with each dose Why is this is not working why Should I go back on mg sulfate morphine tablet ER and mg hydromorphone x a day Oxymorphone is new to me all the other meds Ive been on over years
5903,Opana,Pain,1,42558,23,I started opana about months ago the withdrawls make you feel like you have the stomach bug and flu at the same time Night sweats every bone feels broken stomach cramping strange negitive thoughts that arent real This medication didnt help at all with my disc heritage gout broken foot sore toothfirst night i wondered if i would make it thru the night I was on mg twice a day hour ER I wouldnt suggest this medication to anyone Its hard to require medication assistance just to move but its evenworse being on a medicaton that didnt help and caused the worst withdrawls of my life It took days to feel better Good luck
5904,Opana,Pain,7,42556,18,I was switched to Opana from OxyContin because even mg of Oxy a day wasnt managing my pain anymore Opana was said to work just as effectively at lower doses with fewer of the miserable side effects of Oxy constipation drowsiness etc I have found that to be the case in general my daily dosage is more like mg per day on this med and I can go to the bathroom again without using a suppository first My pain control started out slightly better on this med but since Im a fast metabolizer of opiates Ive started developing a tolerance to this one too and the pain is bothering me again to the point where I cant function My major complaints about this med is that it is very hard to find and it is costly
5907,Opana,Pain,1,42419,22,Ive been on oxymorphone for years My dr Just put me on Opana mg instead its been days and Im going through withdrawals I have gastropathy which slows down your digestive system Seems my pain dr Doesnt care I had the test a couple years ago that checks to see if your on the right medications It showed that the oxymophone and roxicodone was being processed and was the right medication for me A couple of months ago they wanted to put me on morphine patch And I said no I think that he is being paid to write opana scripts all of a sudden Which to me is BS I hate the gel opana doesnt digest properly My insurance prefer generic cause its cheaper I prefer cause it took care of my pain whereas Opana doesnt
5908,Opana,Pain,7,42415,19,Opana mg doesnt take away all the neck amp back pain but does about so I can function However also for first time in my life gives me headaches hot flashes warm blooded of days a wk amp slightly edgeydifficulty with stressadversity sometimes too
5909,Opana,Pain,1,42383,20,I have been on Opana Er mgs for yrs now Was diagnosed with a herniated disc with an annular fissure at L and Also have degenerative disc disorder spinal stenosis plus more back problems and diagnosed with fibromyalgia All I can say is the Opana ER crush resistant are junk I was prescribed Oxymorphone Hydrochloride ER mg a green pill the pill form was a miracle for me I could get up and go to work hrs and they last with hardly taking a Percocet for breakthrough pain had my life back with the generic The name brand Opana ER are junk I always have an empty stomach when I take and not even an hr later my stomach is upset and always have diarrhea
5910,Opana,Pain,1,42291,12,I just got out of the hospital and Im in excruciating pain The surgeon took out my hip implants and broke my femur I have antibiotic spacers and balls put in I was on a baseline of fentanyl plus mcg every minutes via PCA on top of a mcg patch and mg oxycodone every hours and mgs of Oxycontin every hours Also Ketamine spray every hours I was released with in adequate medication and my PM doc put me on mg of Opana every hours
5911,Opana,Pain,2,42241,11,I have had negative experiences with opana ER mg and mg IR I have had mostly all of the side effects amp my doctor wont listen to me
5912,Opana,Pain,10,42223,38,Been taking Opana for months now and couldnt be happier Diagnosed with DDD in my L L S scoliosis and fibromyalgia years ago My PM doctor put me on MS Contin mg xs a day which I had an allergic reaction tou My feet and legs swelled up He then put me on a fentanyl patch mcg which my body did not tolerate I ended up getting pains down my neck and severe nausea A guy ran a red light and Tboned my side of the car In the hospital they gave me dilauded for pain which completely took my pain away My doctor decided at that point to put me on EXALGO mg x a day Worked better than anything Insurance stopped covering it GAHH Put me on Opana ER x a day and IR x a day Amazing No side effects
5914,Opana,Pain,10,42121,26,Very effective as I cant use NSAIDS and am allergic to many other drugs
5915,Opana,Pain,10,42083,65,Male mid s herniated lumbar discs pinched nerves bone spur stenosis I have been on pain meds for the last years and Opana is by far the most effective paid med Ive ever tried and believe me Ive been on everything Most recently I was on OxyContin mg x a day and Oxycodone IR mg x a day The problem with Oxycodone is that it has a very low half life of hours and is very addictive because of the short duration of action you find yourself quotchasing the painquot I suggested Opana to my PM doctor as I heard good things about it best pain relief Ive had in years I take Opana ER mg x a day and Opana IR mg x a day PRN for breakthrough pain This med is a wonder drug for those in chronic pain
5916,Opana,Pain,10,42035,63,I have degenerative disc disease and Opana is the best pain medication that I have ever used and I have tried them all and I take mgs a day every hours and it usually takes about to minutes to take effect but it works
5918,Opana,Pain,10,41866,67,Within minutes after I took the first pill the pain began to subside and was completely gone within minutes
5919,Opana,Pain,6,41821,35,I have been on Opana IR for months now I have severe migraines due to a cyst on my brain along with bulging discs in my neck It works ok but I also have stadol nose spray if the Opana doesnt help Im on mg x a day I honestly need stronger but since its migraines he wont up it I would recommend it for small pain
5920,Opana,Pain,9,41800,36,Too strong for me If taking Opana s for the first time I suggest starting off with smaller doses then increase gradually Took one the other night nausea set in and I vomited Great loss in appetite like on Adderall minor drowsiness
5921,Opana,Pain,8,41694,32,Rotated me off oxy and onto this for six months Works ok
5922,Opana,Pain,8,41517,106,I have been on MSContin for years In that time only one dose increase I take x mg daily Every months my doc changes medicine I used to be able to get Opana mg x per day and it worked great Even better was Efalgo mg x per day in the morning one at night Now insurance will not pay for either The only medicine I can tolerate is Opana x per day and they really dont work well It is so frustrating that the medicine that is the hardest to tamper with Efalgo is the hardest to get and most expensive If I dont switch every few months I build up a tolerance I suffer from degenerative disc disease in my lower back arthritis etc
5927,Rezira,Cough and Nasal Congestion,10,41142,2,I have had trouble with upper respiratory tract infections since I was a child This is the best cough medicine I have ever taken I have been given them all and the best by far
5928,Rezira,Cough and Nasal Congestion,9,41047,4,This medicine works great Its a little costly
5929,Rezira,Cough and Nasal Congestion,8,40928,5,It works great The only down side is the pseudoephedrine which causes horrible headaches and ruins my sleep
5931,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,43056,0,works great
5932,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,42957,6,It works like a miracle l feel young again There are a few side effects but it is worth the trade off to feel like a man again
5934,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,9,42850,9,After fighting rectal cancer for years I lost the ability to get hard My doctor prescribed mg Viagra which worked for a while and then it got harder to produce an erection The doctor asked me if I thought I could stick a small needle into my penis I told him I could and would if it would help me get an erection I have been using Edex for over years with mostly a good reaction to the drug The only reason I gave it a rating of instead of a was every once in a while when sticking the needle in I would miss the sweet spot on my penis and my erection wouldnt happen or only last a short amount of time Im finding after years of using Edex the needle has become harder to inject and more pain full My wife loves the hardness
5935,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,2,42797,10,I was given the mcg injections Like other people posted I got up in about minutes But when it came to performance I went soft after inserting into my girlfriend This is a big disappointment to her amp makes her feel unwanted She is very close to leaving me because I cant be a man in bed
5936,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,8,42761,15,At my urologists suggestion I used Edex today mg dose and injected the entire tube I had a solid erection in about minutes and it lasted for hours It went up much faster than it went down So it worked Unfortunately it became quite painful so much so that intercourse would not have been pleasureable Doseage can vary from mg so I will try again with a or mg dose I had my prostate removed years ago and havent had a woody until today Im wondering if the pain is from the stretching of the tissues Some indication online that there is less pain with increased use Viagra and Cialis did not work and I had crazy muscle pain with the later So this is my likely last option
5938,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,41953,91,Wow Had Prostrate cancer and it was removed months ago Was still waiting for my erections to start but nothing My doctor prescribed Viagra as well as using a pump Viagra helped in getting the erection up but it would never stay Would just as one would say peter out in a min I also was prescribed some suppository things but the cost was out of this world So next he had me try this EDEX Wow it works like all the above good ratings Erection was up in under min and lasted about hours great huh only problem was the pain I was given the lowest amount Guess its not for me was because it works a because of pain
5939,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,41942,125,This medicine works amazingly for me Having had prostate cancer none of the pills worked with any success Switched to this and have had amazing success The only issue I ever had was a blood pressure med conflicted with it and seemed to stop working After consulting with uroligist he suggested that may be the issue GP changed blood pressure med and it started working again I use it roughly x per week and never have issues I am years old and my significant other is constantly remarking that men my age cannot perform like this on a consistent basis Erection usually last hours and I am able to perform multiple times in that time periold Highly recommend
5940,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,9,41891,63,Greatly improved my relationship amp sex life Highly recommended nothing worked but Edex is great product
5942,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,9,41603,82,I have type diabetes and I have had emergency discectomys I was having major erectile dysfunction issues Long story short went to doc He gave me truth Serumquot injection my word for EDEX because he had to measure both flaccid no problem there and erect hence the quotserumquot Told me to go into waiting room Not fully knowing what was about to happen it felt like the incredible hulk had managed to get into my shorts It was amazing Not only was I alive ALIVE I honestly felt again currently
5943,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,41598,81,Viagra never worked Cialis worked partially I tried the Edex mcg and was amazed at how well it works I read the instructions two or three times to ensure I understood all Took time to locate a good spot and avoiding the veins I was surprised at how little pain there is with the needle my biggest apprehension and I did not get any bruising or discoloration at the injection site Some minor aching which maybe will go away with further useOnset took about minutes and full onset within minutes I would rate the erection at about I am going to try the mcg dosage to see if I can attain closer to Many who post here do not discuss dosage levels I am age I wish I had tried this earlier
5944,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,41589,54,Were very happy It works great First time nothing happened I have used it times Paid big bucks for it but have no regrets
5945,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,41569,58,Outstanding results tried everything My parter amp I are well pleased Edex saved my relationship
5946,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,2,41514,42,I tried Edex for the first time last weekend I was given the mcg and it did not do anything I dont know who was more disappointed me or my wife This weekend we will try a mcg
5950,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,40919,70,Excellent results in the first try removing years of disappointments As a diabetic the use of needles is not new but I was unsure of this location and possible errors It was easy accurate and without side effects
5951,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,40698,82,Tried it last night with great trepidation I am generally a nervous guy about everything and had high apprehension about injecting myself getting a hour boner etc Happy to say that it was super easy to use I got a Mcg kit and was afraid of a priapus so I injected mcg which you can do I carefully put pressure on the area I injected for a few minutes and got no bruising I only got very slight burning that lasted seconds and went away with the aforementioned gentle pressure Got a wonderful erection that lasted about hours I was glad I didnt inject the whole ten mcgs Didnt need to I am and I think most of my problem is psychological Sometimes Viagra just wont work for
5953,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,9,40014,64,Sometimes causes a small bruise pencil point size to as large as inch by inches twice Must add very infrequently bruised as Ive learned to be careful at the injection site Been using mg Edex for about years Like it better than Caverject years for ease of injection and preparation Twice had gotten bent needles but called Edex and the medication was replaced free through my provider Sometimes use a quotringquot with the medication Gave a instead of because of bruising
5955,Edex,Erectile Dysfunction,10,39927,54,Tested today with the urologist Im a year old diabetic in great shape actually but have erectile dysfunction and nothing seems to work They prescribed a mcg of Edex We tried it at mcg Seems to work really well
5956,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,43023,1,I first tried Lo loestrin Fe and it made me feel crazy I switched to a triphasic birth controls and tried trinessa and trisprintec but had an even worse experience I was unbelievably nauseous when I first started and threw up several times Every first week of each month I was dizzy and felt like I was in a fog and the rest of the weeks I was so nauseous that I couldnt eat go to the gym or do anything I switched to minastrin and it was such a life saver I didnt experience any nausea at all I never felt dizzy and I felt very emotionally stable The only downside of this birth control is that I bled for weeks if I took the pill min late amp I started getting ridiculously hungry after a few months and was gaining weight
5957,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,43005,1,I started this birth control in January I am now I have had a steady boyfriend through this time so I figured this would be the best choice especially since i cant swallow pills All I can say is it was not bad for the first months short periods weight loss but somewhere around my th month taking it I started to experience terrible anxiety depression loss of my sense of self and really darkt houghts My cycle also began to alternate I would receive a period one month then then the next month it would be gone which caused paranoia over pregnancy not fun There was not a day my boobs werent sore and my cramps and back pain were awful Do seriously dont take this pill if you have a history with anxiety or depression
5958,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42915,1,I did not like this drug at all had to switch over to it when Loestrin discontinued My skin was the worst its ever been and I gained weight Id been on birth control for years before this and never gained Some months I would have severe hemorrhagic bleeding with clots and other months no period at all I thought maybe because it was a chewable I wasnt getting the full dose of the drug so I started swallowing it whole but nothing changed I have been off for months and my periods now last days and I have little to no cramping
5959,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42878,1,I love taking this pill Set an alarm or two on my phone and I almost always can remember to take it Ive tried the Nuva Ring and the shot and both did NOT work well Nuva ring gave my panic attacks and the shot gave me a nonstop period for three months This pill was perfect lighten and shorten my period each month Ive been taking it for a year with no side effects Its a little costly but its worth it for me
5960,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42875,0,Ive been on this for about months Ive suffered from depression and anxiety since high school but some days it seemed unbearable to the point Ive gotten nauseous and it was never that bad Period lasts about days of this days seemed heavy Even after my period I experienced cramping still more on one side then the other Im debating whether or not to just stop taking it all together I dont feel like myself and I feel short tempered a lot of days and I hate that feeling I rather be on nothing at all and just be happier Skin is not clear but off birth control it does seem to be worse
5962,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42853,7,My daughter began using this drug in December of On January she died from a blood clot to her lung She was not overweight did not smoke or had any conditions that were supposed to have negative implications re use of this drug However in the prescribing doctors notes the Dr advised her not to take this drug This information was never told to my wife by my daughter and therefore in my opinion was a lie This drug I believe killed my daughter My daughter died days before her st birthday
5963,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42851,2,Ive been taking Minastrin for years I have never experienced any side effects that Im aware of my periods are very regular and my cramps are much lighter
5967,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42805,0,Ive been on Minastrin since December amp it has been amazing I used to call in sick at the beginning of my periods throughout most of high school They would last for at least days and were extremely heavy to the point where Id use two super tampons an hour for the majority of the week Id spend my days in bed curled up in the fetal position taking mg of Ibuprofen with no help Got on Minastrin and it helped so much Side effects I felt sick to my stomach the first week when my body adjusted to the pill and Im bloated most of the time But I havent had a period since Ive started the pill amp Ive only spotted so lightly only once My mood swings have decreased drastically since being on Minastrin
5968,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42792,0,I started this pill a couple months before turning just turned so about years or so I did notice the weight gain but I quit smoking at the same time so I dont really know what caused it My periods dont exist anymore My doctor told me I can skip my placebos and never bleed I still spot at random times of the year Usually twice a year and its very light to where I dont have to wear anything I have noticed my mood swings getting pretty bad at certain times but overall the pill works great for me I havent had any issues yet
5969,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42787,3,I took this for over yrs age to almost and wish Id read reviews and realized what was happening to me sooner Ive always been a nervous person but my anxiety went through the roof on this pill However I blamed the anxiety on getting older and maybe the stress of school In hindsight it was definitely the pill I changed from a happy easygoing person to an emotional monster I became easily infuriated and even hit my boyfriend out of rage something I would NEVER normally do I gained weight had acne and became unbelievably moody Stopping this pill was the best decision and I only wish Id never started My advice is to not take this pill but if you choose to be aware of how your body is reacting I wish I had sooner
5970,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,7,42770,1,I started taking Minastrin October I lost weight taking this pill have had great skin and I dont really have a period I am years old and have one child This pill has been great so far but after reading other peoples experiences with side effects I feel relieved knowing that Im not the only one that has frequent mood swings the week before I start my placebo pills I dont take my pill at the same time everyday Overall this has been a great contraceptive
5971,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42732,3,Before this I was on the Lo Lo estrine which Im back on This pill was way to strong for me it would cause me to miss a period every other month Also the side effects were so BAD I was super emotional the entire month I would be taking it I also had so much anxiety and I would even wake up anxious frenquently That never happened so often before The bleeding was irregular I also was bloated all the time I definitely wouldnt recommend this pill
5972,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42723,3,Ive taken this pill for around years now and for the most part it has been great for me I gained almost no weight maybe just water weight because I do get kind of bloated my skin has been great and my periods are around days The only downside to it is the mood swings which were way worse the first year or two I started the pill
5973,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42708,3,I started taking this for extremely painful cramps and heavy periods The ONLY positive effect Ive experienced is that my periods are regular and last days instead of I still need heavy doses of pain medicine for of those days to even tolerate my cramps which of course wrecks my digestive system Im significantly more moody and emotional Ive gained about pounds on this pill even though I eat healthier and exercise more than I did before starting it I suddenly had terrible acne which lasted for the first months and it eventually cleared up again My sex drive has also been much much lower This pill was my only option because it is chewable and I cant swallow pills If you dont have to take this medicine then dont
5974,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,7,42707,5,Minastrin was a good call for getting me off of loloestrin That pill was horrid I ended up getting periods on time and they were light Sadly the past months my periods are disappearing I had pregnancy tests done I take the pill right on time too I rather have my period as a comfort of knowing Im not pregnant I also had an increase of rectal pains I have endometriosis and this pill is way too expensive too
5975,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42705,2,I have been on this birth contraceptive for five months some may say you should wait several months to fully review but I am currently dealing with cystic acne that of which I have never ever had before and funny thing is Im also on an acne medication and it still wont fix anything been on it for three and a half months It has not helped my cramps makes me nauseous and I have developed heavy depression from time to time with no reason to Im gonna get off of it as soon as possible but whenever I take the placebo pills is when I get insane acne gonna have to make sure I use a very strong acne medication when I do get off of it since my hormones are so out of balance
5976,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42701,6,does not even begin to describe my awful experience with this pill I was on this pill for almost a week and had to stop it due to EXTREME mood swings and massive depression and anxiety I have been on SSRIs for years now and my depression and anxiety are relatively under control From the minute I started this bc I started gaining weight breaking out and having intense mood swings to the point where I thought I needed to go to the hospital My breaking point with this bc was one night when I went through the cycle of angryviolent thoughts to intense anxiety to feeling completely normal That cycle happened about times in an hour After this experience I am now terrified to try another birth control method besides condoms
5977,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,7,42689,1,I before starting this read a lot of negative reviews My endocrinologist wanted to try this as a way to see if my hair loss acne and a few other issues were related to something that this medication would help I have been on it for a month In the first week my skin cleared about and since my hair has stopped falling out Some of the extra body hair I was growing has ceased and also disappeared It does give you headaches and it does make me cry a lot which is abnormal for someone who has no emotional outbursts ever I have not gained any weight I lost three pounds Although it did make me lose a few pounds it does keep your stomach a bit bloated I think it is something that you personally would notice Its good overall
5978,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,42689,3,I was put on this pill about a year and a half ago because I had a large ovarian cyst that had ruptured The main reason I was on it was to prevent any more cyst from happening but I also suffered from intense and painful periods I noticed I was gaining weight so I started watching what I was eating and how much I was exercising It didnt seem to help though and I still continue to gain weight despite eating far fewer calories than I should be Today I went in for my one year appointment and was shocked to find that my weight has gone up another pounds in the past three months When I spoke to my doctor he said that the reason it was happening was because of my medicine and immediately apologized Because I ended up gaining pounds in a year he switching me to a different one However this pill did prevent me from getting other cysts and made my periods much lighter and less painful Not everyone gains as much weight as I did but I also might have a thyroid problem so Im not entirely sure how much of it was the pills fault Overall Im glad that the pill helped keep me safe as long as it did and Im not very upset at the overall result
5979,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42681,2,Worst pill ever I have never experienced such awful acne as when I was on this pill I had cysts everywhere and wanted to just cry I do not ever recommend this to even my worst enemy
5980,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42678,1,Stay away from this pill I have been taking this pill for about six months now I experienced several side effects including breakthrough bleeding migraines bloating weight gain pounds and horrible mood swings My boyfriend probably thought I was a psycho because I would always get pissed off at the most random things I give him all the credit for putting up with it I am finally switching to a new pill
5981,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,5,42274,34,Had AFib for months Did the cardio version once Went on this drug days later tried cardio version again and it worked Been on drug now for days Feeling tired have shortness of breath with even light exercise like walking around the block Also headaches not happy about it
5982,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1,42227,34,Only on it for days After days started having shortness of breath muscle spasms in upper back pounding heart rate fatigue stiffness in neck and face
5985,Flecainide,Atrial Flutte,4,42146,19,Kept me in regular sinus rhythm but after three years on the med I failed a stress test due to QRS widening a potentially fatal heart rhythm irregularity Doctor states it was caused by the medication
5986,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,10,42135,21,I have been on Flecainide since for Afib and I am very pleased I would suggest trying this before a Defibulator or letting them do Ablation
5987,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,42131,60,Have been taking per day mg tablets for about years Irregular heart beat and high pulse rate with even brief exertion have been essentially eliminated My life is much more comfortable and much less worrisome I do believe my vision has become somewhat more blurry but the outweighs the
5988,Flecainide,Atrial Flutte,10,42037,8,Works Wonders
5989,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,6,41940,58,On occasions taking Flecainide triggers my atrial fibrillation Its quite immediate about minutes after taking the medicine It doesnt happen all the time Sometimes I just wonder if I should stop taking it
5992,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,41880,52,Ive been dealing with atrial fibrillation for about a year and a half now and it stinks Ive had the surgery where they go in and sap the connection in your heart but it didnt fix it Helped a little but Im struggling getting some atrial fibrillation symptoms so my Dr put me on flecainide first mg times a day than a MG twice a day A mg worked for awhile mths but now around an hour or two before my nd dose of the day I start having symptoms very sad dont know what to do Medicine does seem to work for the most part
5995,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1,41799,87,Flecainide caused increased incidents of atrial fibrillation Each time I visited the doctor with increased incidents he would increase the dosage until I finally figured out that the flecainide was the cause Stopped taking the medicine and the incidents decreased
5996,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,41649,64,yr old male Athlete Lone atrial fibrillation year and a half on Felcainide The medicine works but episodes of Atrial fibrillation still occur just not as bad and not as often Because Im an athlete my Afib episodes occur more about time a month sometimes just once a month Some last a few hrs but some last up to hrs or more I still exercise but not when Im in Afib cause it causes shortness of breath Note my episodes dont really feel like Im at a bpm at rest They just feel like Im out of rhythm at a normal rate but of course this is me checking my pulse without a EKG
5997,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,41627,28,Ive had Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia for years It got so bad I was in incessant PSVT one episode right after another for hours at a time Had two cardiac ablations Ive been on other meds like Cardizem Toprol Nothing works to stop PSVT like Flecainide I only take mg once a day instead of the usual mg twice a day and that works for me with no noticeable side effects Without it I would have to get a pacemaker
5998,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,41521,124,I have Lone Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and was having monthly hour episodes very symptomatic shortness of breath pounding in my chest fatigued but all self terminating I went on mg twice per day flecainide in February which kept the thing at bay for months but in August had a hour episode my dose was then upped to mg times per day which I space in equal doses throughout the day so as not to get flecainide highs and lows in my bloodstream and so far have been months free of the dreaded thing oh yes I also take mg of bisoprolol fumarate once per day and mg dispersable aspirin once per day So as far as I am concerned its a wonder pill Before this I was getting more and more depressed with the episodes
5999,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,41482,120,This medicine works in minutes for me Too bad more doctors arent familiar with it Even some of my own cardiologists never prescribed it took years of lone atrial fibrillation and one savvy old cardio doctor in the ER one night to make life easier Now I dont leave home without it
6000,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,41397,92,Ive suffered with Atrial Fibrillation off and on since Today was the first time I have tired Flecainide It took hours to work I didnt have any side effects other then feeling a little tired I seem to get atrial fibrillation every other year when I drink or eat something really cold This episode was brought on by a cold glass of milk I was in A Fib for days next time Ill take a Flecainide I am not a pill taker and I refuse to take these on a day to day It will only be as needed
6002,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,10,41282,34,I have been taking Tambocor for years and it had been been effective with little to no side effects As long as you do not have heart disease or blockages
6003,Flecainide,Atrial Flutte,10,41238,26,Several times my heart went into palpitations due to overexercise or stress within hours my heart returned to normal
6004,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,41152,98,I used it for years After years I started having peripheral vision problems of tiny white moving spots I assumed it was an eye problem but my ophthalmologists didnt see a reason It is a side effect of this medicine
6006,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,41049,59,Completely eradicated vagotinic atrial fibrillation No side effects I am a healthy athletic active male who has been diagnosed with lone vagotinic AF I initially tried the quotpill in the pocketquot approach I was so good at predicting my occurrences I coordinated with my Doctor to use as prophylactic medication I still have occasional PVCs but they are less frequent So far a smashing success Key point talk with a cardiologist before embarking an any treatment
6008,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,40974,84,I started on Flecainide in Started with mg twice a day Atrial fibrillation episodes continued but when I stepped it up to mg twice a day episodes kept at bay Only problem is when I forgot a dose then episodes happen and real bad rhythms to boot Got to be on time each day with dosage or else not protected No side effects at all
6009,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,40937,74,Suffered from AF every few months for a couple of years before going on Flecainide with Metoprolol It has been three years and have only experienced two very short less than hour episodes and the occasional flutter Have also been able to reduce dosage of both medicines without any effect Minimal side effects Life it much better
6010,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,7,40914,41,I have been taking minimum dosage for about a year Every day I have fluttersflopping about an hour before and after dosing I have not had other side effects but cannot figure out if I am experiencing maximum efficacy Fortunately I dont have severe atrial fibrillation episodes
6012,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,40877,52,episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in years all resolved with iv flecainide in AampE more episodes in last last year all resolved within hours at home by taking pill in pocket ie mg flecainide Cant work out consistent trigger factor so avoid all known ones Background treatment for hypertension with ramipril and beta blockers for rate control but otherwise very fit and healthy year old woman Brilliant to be able to treat without hospital admission
6013,Flecainide,Atrial Flutte,10,40874,25,Excellent result in preventing quotatrial fibrillationquot episodes however I have developed a rash head neck arms below elbow and lower legs severe flushing and itching Flecainide dose is mgday with mg amiodarone four timesweek I am considering an ablation in hope of getting off the medicines
6014,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,5,40865,42,No room to here get into my history of AF and flutter so will make it short Because of serious AF episode resulting in hospitalization my cardiologist increased the Tambocor to mg twice a day had been on twice a day for or so years Always had dizziness shortness of breath and feeling unstable since taking this medication However since increasing to the mg a day side effects increased and are getting worse Just experienced the flashing lights today for first time My search of flecainide and flashing lights brought me to this site Thank you Will reduce dose again to mg a day until I can see cardiologist next Wednesday
6016,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,8,40826,64,I was having regular episodes of atrial fibrillation Often per day lasting from a few minutes to several hours Started on mg flecainide twice a day Episodes stopped but suffered from muscle soreness and felt tired all the time Doctor dropped the dosage to mg twice a day Symptoms lessened and have not had an episode in years
6017,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,40821,25,I have been taking flecainide mg twice a day for months Had two episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation prior to this cardioverted within hours with the first and converted to normal rhythm while waiting for a cardioversion the second time No episodes of atrial fibrillation since though I think I may be getting occasional ectopics probably had them before but more vigilant now Feel fit and well but holiday insurance is higher than my husbands now
6018,Flecainide,Atrial Flutte,10,40813,44,This medicine has been great for me I was first prescribed a betablocker when diagnosed However it made me so sick and sluggish that my doctor switched me to Flecainide He warned me not to read about it on the internet because of all the warnings but I knew I had to do something I have been on this medicine for years with no problems mg x day It has made a big positive difference for me I had a headache for about days when I first started but not since No other side effects at this dosage
6019,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,40750,39,After a year of various medicines including Inderal Cardizem Multaq and Toprol XL I was started on flecainide mg twice daily with Toprol mg XL It has made a BIG difference in my quality of life Prior to taking it I had a resting heart rate of and often had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia that sent me to the ER times in months I felt bad all the time I recently had an EP study which revealed that an ablation is not an option for me so I am back on flecainide again Feeling good again I am an otherwise healthy yo female
6020,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,40709,67,I have been on this medicine for about years I take a large dose mg twice a day I previously suffered from PVCs PACs and Atrial fibrillation PVCs were the main culprit and they were very bad Normal heart I was on Sotalol but over time that became less effective and possibly even proarrhythmic The Flecainide has pretty much kept me in normal sinus rhythm since I started taking it with a few breakthroughs I have also given up caffeine alcohol sugar and I now use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea I also try and get a minimum of hours of sleep Combined with the Flecanide I am virtually free of the heart rhythm problems
6022,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,40656,23,Was switched to flecainide in gradually titrated up to mg twice a day Full control maybe one episode a year or when I forget two morning doses in a row and they last a few hours not like the on my earlier medicines quinidine sulfate all it did was give me almost permanent diarrhea
6023,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1,40490,47,Caused severe side effects
6024,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,6,40472,67,Flecainide works for me but caused symptoms that mimicked MS I was put on Flecainide in October for Atrial fibrillation Started having dizzy spells and vertigo soon after Then started getting migraines never had it before in my life and seeing flashing lights Ringing in the right ear started in November Then by February episodes of incontinence slurred speeches confusion difficulty focusing on conversations stumbling falling tingling in finger tips dropping pens dishes anything I held Feared I had multiple sclerosis After tests for MS all negative I went to my cardiologist and asked if Flecainide may be the cause He said not likely but lets stop it and see Four weeks after stopping all symptoms cleared
6025,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,10,40467,24,I have been taking a combination of medicines flecainide mg twice a day and metoprolol mg twice a day to control idiopathic paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia for two months now Trying both medicines separately did not work for me During the first two weeks of starting flecainide I experienced moderate to severe side effects including visual disturbances mostly peripheral shakiness vertigo weakness nausea fatigue and bowel changes Since my body had a difficult time with the medicine both medications were reduced in half It is much better now but I am still hoping this is not a longterm treatment I give this medicine a rating for effectiveness I have not had a single episode including PVCs since being on both medications
6026,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,40435,45,I have been taking flecainide for over a year now for atrial fibrillation I also have had PVCs all my life I have not had one episode other than a few flutters now and then since taking it I take mg twice a day The only negative aspects are some dizziness on occasion usually when turning my head too quickly and the fact that I dont like taking pills I do occasionally forget to take them That is my one big problem remembering to take them on schedule I worry about that
6028,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,8,40274,44,Started flecainide months ago after very frequent episodes of AF Tried bisoprolol first but suffered side effects and still had AF Couldnt sleep and sat round like a zombie Now I take very low dose bisoprolol and mg flecainide twice a day Life is normal again but I get a bit breathless with exercise like walking up steep hills Im a year old female and was very fit until years ago At least I now have a near normal life
6029,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,40207,53,I have had Atrial Fibrillation for about years with episodes about times a year These episodes would last from a few minutes to hours I was taking Cartia XT during this period with some success My doctor just put me on Flecainide because I want to live my life without any episodes I have gone about a month and things are going well The frequent flutters are gone and I have not had a full blown episode at all I do not have any side effects I am years old healthy and very active
6031,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,40170,20,SInce increasing to mg twice a day I have only had one ish minute afib eipisode in the last yearsThe side effects I get are visual shadows and slight afterimages at night The side effects are reassuring to me Ive assumed that for me the side effects are proportional to the therapeutic effect For me exercise increases the side effects a lotI gave it a out of but will change it to a of if I find I dont need to avoid my afib triggers
6033,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,2,40095,50,I was on Flecainide for weeks This did help with AFib however began having neurological side effects I couldnt speak slurred speech etc Doctors thought I was having a stroke at and it was all from the medication Stopped taking immediately and the side effects were gone This side effect was not mentioned
6035,Flecainide,Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,9,40036,22,I began Tambocor nearly years ago when frequency of episodes increased to weekly I have had no bouts of tachycardia since
6039,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,39901,42,I have been taking it for over yearsI am on the lowest dosage and to this point no side effects
6040,Flecainide,Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,9,39869,3,My son who is eight and a half months old has been on flecainide for almost eight months It has worked wonders he has had no side effects and has had no SVT episodes I am very grateful for this drug
6041,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,39845,113,Have been taking Tambocor for years mgday Have only had Atrial Fibrillation episodes when I forgot to take it
6042,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,8,39797,35,I started using Flecainide with low dose Toprol XL about year ago after severe atrial fibrillation which lasted weeks Flecainide stopped the atrial fibritallation after days It has been a God send I have no idea how this stuff works but it does
6045,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,9,39678,109,I have been using tambocor for Atrial Fibrillation for about years now and it has been a very effective drug for me Since being on mgs I havent had an attack for a year
6047,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10,39648,58,I had absolutely horrible irregular racing heart episodes I had Metoprolol and gained weight it was miserable and didnt stop the problemI just became fat with a racing irregular heart beatI am using Flecainide now about three months and I have my life back My heart works again I dont know how this stuff works but my quality of life is MUCH improved Thank you
6050,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42384,8,When I got my period at I was getting it times a month for days each Literally half of my life I was on my period Then I was on a pill that was good Tilia Fe and got my period regularly for days at a time Then my doctor told me about this pill and that her entire staff used it because they either got their period for days or not at all I was sold And Im still sold after a solid year on it NO weight gain NO cramps NO mood swings and I get my period for days max Its a miracle pill for me Im so sad to read such negative reviews about minastrin its funny how pills are so different for people YAZ made me completely insane it is very expensive though at I would pay a million I LOVE IT
6051,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,42380,2,A little history This is the first birth control pill I have been on which is now a total of months The first month I spottedbleed for two weeks straight The second month I spotted for one week prior to my actual period Third month no spotting but had a full blown period for days the whole last week of the pill pack I definitely see myself being moodier since taking this pill but no aniexty or depression or acne However one side effect is excessive weight gain Since taking this pill I have gained pounds and counting I am considering a switch for this reason alone as I practice portion control which has kept my weight consistent for almost years Good to try but weight gain is a major con
6052,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42377,6,Before I started taking this I was very easy going and rarely let little things get to me As soon as I started taking it I got horrible mood swings which have continued on and off ever since I give my boyfriend all the credit in the world for putting up with it Also immediately started gaining weight about lbs until I basically started starving myself Plus my breasts grew from about a C to a DD and starting to feel saggy which wreaks all kind of havoc on my back and stomach muscles My periods have been very heavy and previous were always very light It seems like the only days Im not bloated are when I take the placebos I only rated as high as I did because I havent gotten pregnant p yet
6053,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42374,7,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PILLThis is my second month with this pill and let me tell you how horrible my experience has been Sudden weight gain like literally lbs more during this past two months Lately Ive been very depressed Ive had two panic attacks pain on my left arm and short of breath I thought I was having heart problems and rushed to the ER and my heart is fine This is all the pill this pill is driving me crazy Ive never felt like this in my life So many mood swings Im stopping these pills starting now The only good thing is that your period is lighter and you get zero cramps THATS IT
6054,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42374,4,Hit or miss correlation with my cystic acne and my diet period is only days IF I even have one I love it
6055,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42372,2,The first month was awful with it I was so moody But the following months it was okay Ive been on it almost a year and it has become a nightmare My periods get heavier each month I have absolutely NO sex drive and Ive never been depressed or had anxiety but this definitely has made me depressed My husband and I almost split because of my mood swings Needless to say Im getting off of it Ill try something else
6057,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42366,9,I have been taking this pill for almost a year probably by far the worst birth control Ive ever taken side effects wise This pill makes you bleed and spot ALL the TIME I take it at the exact time every single day and yet somehow my period will start like weeks before Im supposed to get it and it will last for like a week of just pure spotting This is verrrrrry annoying and inconvenient for a woman with a boyfriend You never know if one day youre just going to start bleeding or not Periods are just as bad as before I was on the pill cramps bloating and heaviness of bleeding varies I also have almost a non existent sex drive which sucks Also I have been having stomach issues on and off since Ive been taking this
6058,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42366,3,After having an IUD my Dr gave me this to try Periods were very light No cramping or pimples Didnt care for the aftertaste of chewing the pills so I just swallowed them Every time I refilled my Rx there were problems getting my insurance to work They were able to cover it for a while but now my insurance wont cover it at all At over month I will be finding another medication
6059,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42355,4,So I have been taking this pill for a month and a and Im glad that I will be switching back to Lo Loestrin Fe This pill was fine for the first month but once it got into my systemoh boy Im nauseous all the time which is only relieved by burping or breaking wind Gross I get that its a bodily function but I had FIVE days of breakthrough bleeding My doctor told me its normal to not get a period after starting this pill But when youre sexually active it gives you pause when you dont get one have not missed a pill My boyfriend says that my moods have changed and that Im lathargic when Im with him I also get that Im stressed out with the holidays but I really dont need my birth control adding to it
6060,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42350,5,Ive been on this birth control for months I havent had a period Ive gained lbs my face is broke out my hair is falling out I have no sex drive more frequent moods of depression this is the worst and Im getting off it ASAP
6061,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42349,0,Took minastrin for about a year and a half and saw nothing but bad side effects My period was regular and short but this has never been a problem for me anyway I gained weight had an increase in frequency and severity of my headaches sometimes lasting for days at a time with no relief and my skin has gone crazy I never had bad skin before taking this bc That is probably the worst part for me since it is visible to everyone around me
6063,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42338,3,I wish I could rate it I have always had anxiety and depression and its worsened everything Plus its made me break out more and has made my periods spotty rather than regular I know everyones body handles things differently but if you have existing mental health conditions I would especially suggest staying away from this medicine
6064,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42336,5,My GYN prescribed this pill to help with my heavy periods I HATE IT Ive been on it for almost months I take it at the exact same time everyday and have never missed a dose I have had the worse mood swings and have been bleeding for a whole month I experienced what I would call a very heavy period changing my pad every min or wearing adult diapers times in one month and the cramps are horrible I went in to to see my dr the second time I experienced the heavy bleeding and she said that this is normal for the first months of taking this med I wish that I had NEVER started this medication My periods were heavy before the pill and now they are worse than before At least before the pill I only bled days out of the month
6065,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,42336,3,You can actually call this birth control because I didnt want to have sex while I was on it I had no type of sex drive whatsoever and Im always in a mood I had mood swings depression and was nauseous all the time The only thing that minastrin was good for was my period were light and lasted two days and I didnt get pregnant I was originally on loestrin fe and stopped Loestrin was the best birth control ever I went back on birth control a year later because I couldnt afford to pay for it at the time but now my insurance basically covers anything now The doctor prescribed me minastrin and it was the worst thing ever I stopped using it after months and felt so much better
6066,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42324,5,My experience with Minastrin was extremely favorable I was suffering from intense period symptoms overwhelmingly bad cramps that left me bedridden for at least days dizziness uncomfortably heavy flow irregularity and periods that lasted up to days The first month of taking Minastrin was admittedly rough I suffered some spotting and rather invasive mood swings However I have read that this is not common and might be related to the intensity of my periods prior to taking Minastrin Once I got used to having Minastrin in my body it took about months my periods became extremely lowmaintenance I still suffer from mild cramping but I now have regular and very very light periods thanks to Minastrin
6068,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,42319,3,absolutely loved this pill the first months of taking it light period only days no cramps Its very effective pregnancy wise but its been a year now I havent gotten my period since August and it is now November th Sure its nice but it is very unhealthy for the body I am not pregnant if thats what you were thinking the pill just doesnt give me periods I have had terrible tension headaches all year and all the sudden breaking out all in my T zone of the face Blind pimples amp boils under my armpits Along with nausea and drowsiness I am and dont wanna have to deal w all these side effects not too mention the pill makes me feel sad and crazy sometimes I definitely do not recommend it
6069,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42318,9,I have nothing bad to say about this pill I had the Mirena for almost a year and it was the worst bc ever I had bad acne weight gain not able to lose weight and stomach pain I am very active even had a trainer and ate healthy and once I got the Mirena I was not able to lose a pound and felt bloated all the time It also made my migraines way worse About a month after I got it out I lost lbs Then after a couple months I got nexplanon I have pcos so bc helps with my bleeding and cramps I only had that in for a month and it caused weight gain lbs water retention migraines and acne on my neck I have been on minastrin fe for a month and it is a savior No acne no weight gain and has helped my migraines I highly recommend
6070,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42303,2,Before the pill I had very very heavy periods this is my st month on this pill and to say it changed my period drastically is an understatement While I do appreciate that a lot I have NEVER suffered from so many leg cramps in my life Its literally legs cramping up in the middle of the night on a nightly basis Its so painful posole keep telling me that I need to eat more banana but this is the only thing thats been different this past month They started about a week in to my first pack and have been ever since And I agree about the mood swings its really affecting my anxiety and my mood swings are all over the place Add my insurance not covering this pill on top of all that I definitely wont be getting back on this thing
6072,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42292,6,So Ive been on birth control since I was like years old Im now I started taking Loestrin fe for a while which I loved Then I tried out the Depo shot that was cool as well Got back on Loestrin fe since its holy grail for me Never had any problems with this birth control I stopped taking it for a while then of course it was discontinued Now heres Minastrin fe Well I began taking this medicine and would become so ill that I wanted to cry literally every day for about an hour Not only that but the mint taste makes me very nauseous to this day and its been months Ive lost all attraction to my boyfriend after starting this pill IT SUCKS
6073,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42292,2,On a sample from Doctor Day one took pill at pm nausea within within hours Weird temple headaches off and on Day irritable mood upon waking up Experienced unusual muscle weakness at gym at pm came home ate Slightly nauseas Day Iritable and nauseas with temple headaches Day Woke up Not as irritable but had sharp pains in my eyes while wearing contacts After taking pill at pm became very sick around pm Bloated stomach pain bus able to the eye and very nauseas Weird pain in my jaw followed by extreme nausea When I vomited slightly I forced myself to vomit more when the nausea became too uncomfortable nauseas half the he night until I finally fell asleep
6076,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,42489,2,While it was effective I hated the side effects and am discontinuing after less than one month It made me feel hungry and I started to break out I was having sleep issues and bleeding in between periods Im currently on my cycle and Im miserable My period has been heavy for four days and I have cramps This is unusual for me Not worth it
6078,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42468,5,Everyones body is different Ive have nothing but the best experience with his particular BC pill I was on loestrine and was sad to find out it was discontinued Happy to know that the name was the only thing that change and the fact that it is now a chewable tablet Anyways i love it My period become light within the first month I did have horrible headaches for the first few weeks Ive been taking these for years I stopped for about a months and my period went back to being super heavy I love the effects it has on my cycle light and short only about days I didnt experience mood swings or weight gainloss I regret not finding these sooner like when I was in highe school and experience painful cramping
6079,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42465,9,I went on Minastrin to help regulate my periods which were coming every two weeks or so and ever since Ive been on this pill all Ive done is bleed Now Im constantly having my period Hope I dont bleed to death Fml
6081,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42453,11,Honestly I love this birth control so much Ive been on it for almost years and Ive never had any problems I feel it has actually helped me to not gain weight though I am naturally thin to begin with No mood swings no weight gain no weird side effects for me My hair seems to grow faster like from my scalp but no weird body hair growth as I had on a progesteroneonly pill I once tried out yikes No acne No problems The only thing I would say is weird to most but really great IMO is that I havent had a period on this stuff I bleed lightly for day once a year I frequently have unprotected sex with my longterm committed partner and weve never had a problem would recommend
6084,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,42443,3,I started college when I took these But Ive noticed weight gain I thought it was the freshman but its not Also theres been a HUGE decrease in sex drive Stopping these pills now Oh and also I NEVER get acne all of a sudden Im breaking out in places Ive never even got pimples Lastly Im pretty sure my body is reacting to the medication because Ive never had a yeast infection but for some strange reason Ive been experiencing discomfort Read about this before you decide to take it
6086,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42442,3,So I had been experiencing irregular and painful periods due to low body fat and my lifestyle I am an avid runner My doctor said I was suffering from Amenorrhea So he placed me on Minastrin Literally within a week and days of taking the medicine I broke out in severe hives on my legs and arms which were red and itchy I called my doctor and told him and he suggested that I take benadryl for the allergic reaction The benadryl did not help I also was experiencing mood changes where I would either be down in the dumps or angry at the world I was then instructed to stop taking it and begin a new one One day after not taking the medicine I started bleeding heavily and having severe cramps st time I ever had BC
6087,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,7,42430,3,Minstratrin is definitely a hit or miss Everyone will experience the effects differently and I have come to learn this from trial and error I wouldnt say it was horrible but okay Not something I would want to stick withPros Ive experiencedNo weight gainPleasant mint flavored pill doesnt taste like your typical yucky pillShort amp lighter periodsBearable menstrual cramps Cons Ive experiencedMild acneBloatingFatigueChronic Bacterial Vaginitis amp Yeast Infection
6089,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42415,3,Tried other birth control pills and all have me horrible side effects Got this one been using it for yrs and love it No side effects no weight gain I take at night before sleeping so that could help people with side effects
6090,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42413,6,Ive been taking Lo Loestrin for months and I love it I ran out amp had a sample pack of Minastrin and thoughtquotwhat could one month hurt Ill save quot Stupid Never again Ive been nauseous since the first pill with daily stomach troubles My breasts are so sore But the worst is the anxietydepression Ive started waking in the middle of the night with panic attacks and feel anxious pretty much Im going back on Lo Loestrin tomorrow Minastrin amp I are breaking up for good We are no longer friends
6091,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42404,1,While this pill was effective for me in that I did not get pregnant my experience with Minastrin was poor to say the least I had spotting between every single period that usually lasted around days sometimes more My periods were very heavy for days one and two with some of the worst cramps Ive ever had My breasts were in near constant pain but on the bright side stayed the same size when I lost lbs during my time on the pill Ive recently switched to a higher dose of hormones which my doctor said should stop the spotting Good luck ladies
6092,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42402,6,Awful experience NOT the same as loestrin fe which worked perfectly for me This medication caused pains in my stomach severe shoulder and back acne bloating and cramps My mood swings were crazy and I felt awful on this birth control I gave it months and it didnt regulate I developed the worst acne I have ever had and it is painful
6093,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42394,5,This is my th month on this pill My gyno switched me from Loestrin to this because I was having in between spotting and cramping I am and have been on some form of bc pill for a long time It made me nauseous the first two months Periods were much shorter and lighter but cramps were kind of bad Now on my th month I had a day of spotting no cramping and thats it No period at all I ALWAYS have a period So not sure if this is a good or bad thing
6095,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42390,5,HATED IT Was on Loestrin Fe and had no issues my doctor told me they discontinued it and they switched me to this because it was the most like it I completely DISAGREE Felt depressed no energy literally cried everyday for absolutely no reason and had no sex drive
6096,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42389,6,I just very recently started this birth control and I was very wary of it at first because my experience with Loestrin Fe was TERRIBLE But ever since Ive been on this pill its like heaven Loestrin made me super nauseous very moody and angry and completely killed my sex drive Now that Im on Minastrin Fe I feel completely normal Ill admit in the beginning I was slightly moody and I have noticed a slight decrease in sex drive but nothing too major Overall I LOVE this birth control and Im so happy with how it worked out for me
6098,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42385,11,No periods No cramps Clear face Limited mood swings No loss of sexual desire
6099,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42384,13,Ive been on Minastrin for maybe less than a year and for my body it works great I had no nausea less cramping and bleeding and cleared my acne up However I did gain about lbs and lots of bloating Overall it worked great My periods were much lighter and lasted about days plus I havent gotten pregnant Unfortunately my insurance company does not cover it so Ive been paying around per month Keep in mind everyones body reacts to birth control differently so do not get overwhelmed with the negative reviews
6101,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42656,6,I am years old I started taking minastrin at age because my periods were lasting almost days My periods werent bad no cramps heavy bleeding etc but most of those days my period was light and I wore a panyliner because a tampon was irritating But extended use of pantyliner was irritating as well I was also experiencing strong pms type mood swings as well Despite my age my doctor put me on minastrin I maintain a healthy weight eat well non smoker no other health conditionsconcerns etc I have not had a period since I started taking it and it is wonderful I do get moodyirritable about a week before the placebo pills are taken But I am aware of this and quotcheck myselfquot am I overreacting etc
6102,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,42654,5,This is my th pack and Im not loving it Im gaining weight constant burning sensation on my right side losing hair like crazy no sex drive and am now a hyperchondriac I got on it because I was bleeding very heavy after kids weeks straight I have to say the plus side is I do have my period between days and is light Is anyone experiencing what Im going through
6103,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42641,0,Im years old and of course birth control is always a plus for anyone who is sexually active especially teenagers I always use condoms no matter what so Im usually protected I was put on this pill in March of and I was a Sunday starter Usually when I get my period I get heavy bleeding severe cramps nauseaI throw up dizzinessback pains every symptom in the book I get it at the worst level so I tried this pill its stopped the puking and nausea I still get very tired but the cramps arent as bad as they were BUT my mood swings are horrible all the time And I find myself bleeding heavily at random times of the month all the timewouldnt recommend
6104,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42629,4,Minastrin has been great for me I have had not side effects whatsoever I agree with what others say however about periods disappearing It was great when I was not sexually active but now that I am it makes me nervous
6107,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42603,2,I have been on this for almost two years now Remind you Im now but I hate this birth control Everyones body is different but has anyone else had abdominal pain My boyfriend and I can barely get through sex because I have such bad pain Its not even cramping which is what scares me What also scares me is that my period are completely gone GONE It may seem like a pro for some but when I miss months and only get my period for days and its light and looks as if I am spotting That worries me I even took a pregnancy test Multiple actually just to check I would not recommend I havent had problems with skin or weight gain Actually I have lost weight But the abdominal pain and cramping Not worth it
6108,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42598,2,Ive never had weight gain like this in my entire life pounds in just a month On top of that I didnt get my period at all which would be a plus for some people but it just freaked me out and I needed up taking a bunch of tests because Ive never been able to skip my period before Crazy mood swings lots of crying dont recommend at all
6110,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42585,1,I used to take Lowestrin Fe years ago I have been taking Minstarin for months now and Doc switched me to NuvaringPros No period No babiesCons Severe Depression Mood Swings Paranoia lb gain Sleep insomniaI went to the therapist to figure out what was wrong with me and I saw a specialist and they have narrowed it to the Birth ControlMinastrin may not be right for everyone
6111,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42582,4,The medication did its job I definitely had shorter lighter periods But toward month they actually started to disappear Some may see this as a pro but I personally had anxiety by it There was no real effect on my skin good or bad and I had some lower body weight gain hipsbuttthighs but pretty minimal My gripe with this med is the effect it had an my mood I had some weepiness when first starting but dismissed it Similar to other reviews around month I became easily anxious at everything amp while Id noticed a lack of energy thru out my use I was starting to feel depressed I suspected it might be the cause amp quit its crazy how much more energy I have and more myself I feel now
6113,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42568,1,If you decide to take this drug dont Unless you want a period longer than a week migraines and uncontrollable mood swings Lots of crying Did I mention depression Generess is a better option
6114,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42564,5,Ive been taking this pill for almost a year now I had never tried any other birth control prior and Ive had no bad side effects Ive never had a problem with weight gain and I havent experienced any since Ive been on the pill No unusual mood swings My skin cleared up dramatically No terrible cramps anymore and my period has pretty much disappeared Really wish I would have found this sooner
6115,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42561,3,I have been on this for almost months I have had no issues I have had other terrible side effects from birth control but not this one My periods have completely stopped my face has cleared up Only during the brown pills period pills when I would usually get my period I get a couple pimples Sometimes deep cystic pimples and get bloated But other then that its amazing No birth control will be perfect so choose your battles
6116,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42558,16,PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE I started on Minastrin fe in February of because my fiance and I were going to be getting married in April We both were virgins and I had never been on a contraceptive before but we both wanted to wait a while to have kids in our marriage Well at first things didnt seem too bad However I started noticing acne breakout and I was surprised at how I waa easy to cryhowever I thought it was due to wedding planning and not birth control However after a month and a half into our marriageabout month ago I started developing extreme mood swings depression weird thoughts I couldnt seem to cope with suicidal thoughts emotional about everything losing feeling for my husband who believe me I adore and love so very much to pound weight gain panic attacks depression anxiety fatigue swollennes in my legs and feet and even one of my big toes started to go numb I even started thinking the worse things about my husband and losing loss of of feeling for him I was scared to death I was usually full of life and happy and carefree and a very energetic and outgoing young woman who loved her husband and her life I was always active and tried to be health conscious My husband has been extremely gracious and patient through all of this and believe me you do not want to start your marriage out like this So he and I decided to stop the pill about weeks ago mid if June My acne has cleared my swolleness has gone down and physically I am feeling better each day My emotional swings are slowly lessening and I havent had any panic attacks lately I am still struggling but each day I feel mire myself and getting back to the real me SO PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE FOR YOUR SAKE AND THE SAKE OF THOSE YOU LOVE AROUND YOU Stay away from this pill These hormones are synthetic and fake and they arent natural for our bodies It may work gor some people but it is not worth the risk of going through what I have to see if it will work for you as well
6117,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42550,7,I switched onto this pill from orthotrycyclen lo The reason I switched was because ortho was making my acne increase and started making my periods very very painful Minastrin started off okay for me If you despise having a period this is for you This pill was fine until about months in It started to make me nauseas and moody and SO anxious At first I was worried I was pregnant and ended up going crazy and taking about tests Im switching to another pill but basically my biggest issue with this pill is the side effects I got at the month point I never had a period after the first pack which also added to my constant anxiety amp paranoia It was brown the first period and then nothing
6118,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42542,0,Terrible experience Before getting married I decided to go on hormonal birth control I started taking Minastrin months before our wedding and lasted for about that months on it It wreaked havoc on my body and I havent been the same since Its been about years since then I had never had cramping with periods or any kind of pms symptoms for that matter and have always been a very laid back person As soon as I went on it I became extremely temperamental and felt angry about the slightest things I also had TERRIBLE periods with clots and cramping Headaches loss of appetite and break outs everywhere My Doc suggested I try a lower dose but I was done with HBC We switched to Fertility Awarness Method and love it
6119,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42540,2,I have been taking Minastrin for over two years now Acne was never a severe problem for me but I now only break out usually just a few zitspimples nothing major during the last week of the pack like clockwork I did gain weight however the time frame does coincide with my quotfreshman quot so I dont think I can blame it entirely on this medication It does make me a bit moody but predictably so This is the only birth control Ive ever tried and honestly I only have chosen it since its completely covered by my insurance It works well enough I havent gotten pregnant but I am thinking about switching to an IUD since I am worried about drug interference and the risk of blood clotting
6122,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42511,3,Ive been on Minastrin for months now I was prescribed this specific OCP bc I have PCOS This medication has helped decrease my cramps acne and mood swings I would recommend this birth control to anyone I work in an OBGYN clinic so I get samples Not sure how much it would cost if I had to get the prescription filled
6124,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42501,5,I was only on Minastrin a total of two months after switching from Beyaz I only switched because my body was no longer reacting well to the Beyaz after having taken it for years I had increasing breakthrough bleeding With Minastrin I have been getting regular migraines and had headaches every day I gained lbs in the first month even though Im active and eat very healthy Ive never had problems with my skin breaking out and since Ive started taking this medication Ive had constant breakouts all over my face I normally have no stomach issues but this also gave me random stomachaches Everyone reacts differently to medications but this one was certainly not right for me My doctor has me trying Sprintec now fingers crossed
6125,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42290,6,Ive been on this pill for about years now and I have to say it is amazing One thing I will note is that before I first started using birth control I had very regular periods I strictly went on the pill for extra protection when I went into college After starting the pill my periods became less heavy and they became some what irregular as the years went on The first year on the pill I would have a very very light period each month BUT as the years went on I would get my period every months As of now this is the th month that I have not got my period I am not pregnant but it is very odd to go this long without a period Most woman would like that but I like knowing that I would get my period every month or so
6126,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42289,10,I have endometriosis and polycystic ovarian disease Both of which have been proved via ultra sound and surgeries Ive been off birth control for years and decided to start taking it again to preserve bit fertility I have left After only a few days I felt what was similar to a UTI paired with throwing up On top of that I have had panic attacks high anxiety suicidal thoughts you name it Following a heart to heart with a close friend my mom and my sister Ive realized the birth control definitely induced this I havent changed anything over the past except that For anyone that has a very busy life stressed anyways or has any kind of underlying depressionanxiety please be very careful when you take this
6127,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42286,3,I would definitely recommend this pill to anyone I used to have terrible cramps amp heavy period but since Ive been on minastrin I spot for days at the most amp really dont even need more than a panty liner also barely any cramping Take the pill as the directions say amp if it makes you sick TAKE WITH FOOD In the beginning I was literally throwing up every night I was so sick but then I discovered that if I take the pill with dinner I have no side effects Other types of birth control used to make me super moody amp lose my hair but Ive had no issues with this one Although it is expensive because it is brand name to me its worth it You can find discounts online that help if your insurance doesnt cover it
6128,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42286,7,This pill caused me to get two periods a month and constant breakthrough bleeding The worst experience Ive ever had on a pill I took this pill for months and never missed a pill Switching right away
6130,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42284,3,I have been on different birth controls over the years and due to changes in my hormones I have been spotting before my period so my doctor put me on this BCP and I have getting really bad acne mood swings and my lips are very chapped Ive been on it for months and Im still spotting and now I have side effects After I finish this pack Im gonna stop taking this pill My doctor said to give it months but I just cant with these side effects
6131,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42284,2,Im nearing the end of the second month on this pill First of all this pill does its job which is the only reason it got a I am terribly emotional and I feel sick weeks of the month The only time I dont feel at least a little off is when I take the brown pills to have my period Ive also experienced horrible leg pains and aches Ive been throwing up for the past days and ever since starting Ive gotten horrible acne Im going to try one more month and if no change Im talking to my doc about switching bc
6132,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42282,7,Md prescribed my yo daughter this med without mentioning the price tag it carries for month supply I will not be accepting the delivery of this ridiculous scamming of patients
6133,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42280,4,Omgthis is just some bullcrap I was on minastrin before I got pregnant and the periods werent really heavy but I cramped really bad So I decided after the baby I would go back on it until my paragard comes in Whelp I get back on it keep in mind Im already facing post partum depression I have every symptom listed I cant believe it would make me suicidal but yesit does I stopped taking it because I couldnt stand the spottingwell of course that turned into a heavy period Then weeks later I got another full period So I went without birth control for another month which wasnt cool So I decided at the start of my current period I would start back taking it And here I amspotting after my period and I have blood clots
6135,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42276,2,I have been on many different pills and never had side effects until the last couple and would bleed for weeks So I went on this one to help with that The first weeks I was kind of a monster I did have jobs and school with no day off so that may not have helped But the symptoms subsided Now my breasts are very tender and are growing at age I havent had other weight gain I am loving this BC with hardly any bleeding months in and I love it so far Just not covered by insurance But the manufacturer has something that helps make it more affordable the pharmacy just has to run it through a different way
6136,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42273,7,I agree with the girl that said if she can rate this any less than a she would My doctor put me on it to stop my migraines after switching from Yaz Im and have been on the pill since I was Ive struggled with depression in the past and this gave me such bad mood swings that I have not felt this depressed in the longest time Still getting migraines Skin is breaking out Ive always struggled with that but Yaz is the only one that helped apparently Im supposed to start my rd month until I see my Dr again but at this point I decided not to take it and wait until my visit
6138,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42270,1,Im on my second month of Minastrin Fe and I have to say that I really havent had any real problems on this birth control I had accidentally forgot to take my birth control for a day about two days ago so yesterday I took when I remembered I didnt take it followed instructions and started spotting soon after The next day I woke up to my quotperiodquot which wasnt expected until October which is in about a week and a half Im now on my quotperiodquot for the second day I also know that you arent supposed to smoke cigarettes on this birth control Also I have multiple mood swings a day due to MinFe but I pull myself together Nothing too bad that a person cant handle
6139,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42258,10,Within a day of starting this I started experiencing horrible side effects my skin started to break out and my appetite was fluctuating drastically But the worst part was the terrible mood swings I became terribly depressed and was crying for an hour day for no reason Couldnt finish the month
6140,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42251,7,I was on Loestrin before it was discontinued and have been on minastrin for a little over a year now Immediately starting I stopped getting any sort of bleeding and started getting cyst zits around my second week of the pill each month I never had any acne when I was a teen This was tolerable until about nine months into the pill when I started getting large white heads all around my nose and chin Bye bye minastrin
6142,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42248,15,I freaking love Minastrin Fe I was on Loestrin before and when the generic came out was happy to save money but even better than that now its FREE with my insurance Plus Ive been on this for I dont know years and dont have periods At all Its awesome No periods no cramping no hormonal issues Yes I have women ask how can I tell if Im pregnant but I just dont worry about it I use the pill and my husband uses a condom and honestly I had more worries about pregnancy before because if you were a day or two late it was total meltdown time Now its just a nonissue in my mind There are no negatives to this pill for me
6143,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42247,15,If I could give this pill less than a quotquot I WOULD I was switched to this pill by my OBGYN after I was told that the LoEstrinFE I was previously taking was now MinastrinFE I was on the Loestrin for over years with zero problems and zero side effects Then the lovely Minastrin came in to my life and I immediately began to bloat and put on weight like I never had before I have always been fairly lean for my height because I eat strict paleo and do crossfit approximately times per week EVEN WITH KEEPING ALL OF MY SAME HABITS I HAVE GAINED LBS The weight gain on top of the bloating is more than enough for me to stop taking this pill because I would rather deal with the pain of endometriosis than deal with this weight gain
6144,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,42247,11,I am and have been on this for almost a year now I like this medication because for me it has done a great job on easing my headaches and nausea I still get some once in a while but its not as bad as before I have not had any real problems with my mood but I do see that I cry more often and sometimes get a little depressed but I am able to blow it off The only real criticism I have about this medication is that when I started on my period again it was regular then it stopped COMPLETELY but I was like what t I would spot but at random times For the year I have been using it I can say I have only got my period maybe twice Very hard to know if ur preg without a period
6145,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,7,42246,10,I had been on a different BCP for over years and had a generally low libido but pretty much no period with that pill I went off to have a child then retuned to the same pill and became very emotional and depressed with a worse libido My doctor changed me to Minastrin and my emotions were much better and libido improved also I do get spotting the week before my period which is non existent However now that Ive been on this pill for over a year my weight has increased pounds I am so hungry and my blood sugar doesnt seem to be very steady I tend to get low blood sugar easily and am not a diabetic So now Im really hungry and can eat as much as my husband and even though Im exercising more I continue to gain weight
6146,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42244,8,I am years old and because of how bad my cramps used to be I have been on birth control since I was I was recently on sprintec and because of how high the dose was I started taking minastrin fe I first read the reviews which I didnt like so much but decided to try it anyway I started this pill and immediately my boobs got about a size bigger which I didnt need I have been bloated for weeks and my hair has been literally falling out I am not one who goes by reviews because everyones body is different but honestly this pill has been a nightmare and I would never recommend this to anyone
6148,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,42234,5,i have been on minastrin for months after switching from the nuva ring big mistake i am constantly bloated on this pill which is the most frustrating part I have gained pounds and i work out days a week and eat extremely clean i am going off this pill for fear that this weight gain will continue my friend gained pounds i am often achy and have many nights of restless sleeping i have suffered from depression in the past so that might have something to do with the occasional moodiness overall bc is different for everyone but Im getting off this pill
6149,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42223,2,I am years old and I started taking my first birth control pill ever Minastrin in late January The first month I took this pill I was extremely emotional Its now just over months later and I have had stomach crampspain as well as bleeding of all sorts of colors for the entire month My boyfriend and I were so convinced I was pregnant because of all the symptoms and side effects associated with this pill I never have a cramp a day in my life until I started this pill and now along with the cramps comes bleeding and horrible stomach pain Anything that causes such differences in your daily life and this much stress is not worth it I am starting a new pill tomorrow thankfully
6150,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42222,4,Ive been on this pill for a month It served its purpose no cramps pregnancy and a light period Im an yr old girl and this is my first form of bc Ive had no mood swings depression weight gain irregular spotting etc However Im incredibly bloated I will be going off this pill because if you didnt know me you would assume Im pregnant I exercise regularly and have always had a flat stomach but the water retention just wont go away Overall this is a good pill It caused me no nausea and the bloating is my only side effect Its just not worth it to me to look so ridiculous I highly reccomend this pill for everyone to at least try like I did and then switch if you dont like it
6151,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42222,14,I have been on this pill for about months and the only side effect Ive experienced is that I no longer get my period at all Ive been to my doctor who says that this is completely normal The reason I started taking Minastrin is because I had very severe period cramps that often caused me to throw up and pass out and since Ive stopped getting my period obviously this problem has been solved
6153,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42211,4,Im giving this pill an because for me it had very minimal side effects I didnt gain any weight it cleared any blemishes and experienced no mood swingsdepression However I did experience SEVERE spotting and breakthrough bleeding even after being on the pill for three months My doctor told me to give my body three months to adjust and during my fourth month on this pill I bled for the entire first week of my fourth pack Therefore it feels like Im getting a period or at least have to wear pads twice a month The spotting is absolutely annoying and Im strongly considering switching to another pill or just taking myself off of birth control entirely
6155,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42207,7,I was on this birth control for year and I really have no complaints about it The only thing that bothered me in the beginning was that I would get so nauseated at night after I would take the pill but after a month my body got use to it and I had absolutely no other problems The only reason I am having to switch is because my insurance isnt covering it and its a little to expensive But I would recommend this to anyone
6156,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42204,1,Ever since Ive been getting my period Ive had dier cramps to the point where id have to miss school for days each month and take sleepy medicine to knock me out Minastrin absolutely releaved my cramps I will occasionally feel a discomfort but not bad enough where I have to take pain killers At first when I got it I barely got my period but now Ive had it for close to weeks Im not sure if this has to do with the birth control but probably If I wasnt continuously on my period than I would rate it at an because sometimes it gives me mood swings as well
6157,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42198,2,Just had a baby two months ago And wanted to start birth control Bc I have bad cramps Before my pregnancy I was on birth control for six years So far so good No side effects just wish it was an birth control out to help lose weight
6158,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42194,4,I have been on this pill for several months now amp I would recommend this pill o anybody The only side effect that is gave me is change in my appetite One week Id eat like a pig and the next week Id eat like a bird Although I ate like this I didnt gain any weight at all Eating differently each week never bothered me
6159,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42193,10,This pill is horrific I have been on it for only a few days and its making me feel super emotional and depressed and I have never felt this way before I will no longer be taking this and need to find something to switch to
6160,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,42191,4,I am finishing my second month on this pill and am switching to a new pill The major issues I had while taking this pill was terrible stomachaches and extremely heavy breakthrough bleeding however I did not experience mood swings weight gain or any other adverse effects
6161,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,42188,7,I have been on this pill for about months I am and newly married I thought Id check and see if any others had sleeplessness and restlessness Not sure if it is this pill or the big life change Also I dont think I am depressed just super emotional I can cry at the drop of a hat Seriously My hubby doesnt notice that change but I do Not sure how linked the sleeplessness and emotional tears are
6162,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,42182,10,I have been on Minastrin for about months and have had no real negative physical side effects My boobs grew a half of a cup side but that was it for physical effects I did however experience emotional and psychological side effects I noticed that I rarely wanted to leave the house and had no desire to see friends It made me extremely overdramatic and moody I just switched to another BC because I was beginning to feel too depressed Im not certain that this depression is coming from Minastrin but it began around the time I started this pill
6163,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42181,15,I had to switch over to Minastrin because Loestrin was discontinued Ive been on this pill for a year and a half now and its the worst pill out there Im and fit but I have developed varicose veins from this pill Ever since I started they have been popping up everywhere on my legs Also I have no sex drive putting a strain on my relationship And I have gained over pounds Im just dropping this pill all together
6164,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42180,2,Ive been using this birth control for almost a year now Its my very first pill amp I havent had any problems with weight gain mood or even spotting in between periods However it is important to take it daily around the same time At the same time is better if possible I use this as my main method of birth control
6165,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42179,13,I wanted to write this review because I see others really struggling with Minastrin at first and I want to tell you take heart Im in my second month on this pill and the first was rough I had mood swings bloating and bleeding every day for a month I felt miserable and was convinced I would stop taking this However took the very first pill of my second pack and every single symptom disappeared overnight I dont have a single issue anymore and the bleeding stopped Not even experiencing spotting I know every body is different so Im not saying this will work for you as well but in my case sticking it out that first month was so important Im really glad I stayed with it and I hope you give it a chance too
6166,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42174,10,hello ladies well I started taking this pill about MONTHS ago after taking Lo Loestrin for over a year which btw I loved I switched because apparently my doctor wanted me to get my period back and he thought that by increasing the estrogen dosage my period would ergo come back Well it didnt So far I do NOT like this birth control My mood has changed and so has my libido which is crazy because Im like the female version of Christian Grey Fifty Shades of Grey reference I gained FREAKING pounds I already cant see things that are far away and this pills has made it worse I CANNOT wait to go back to Lo Loestrin Hope my experience helps some of your ladies and please let me know if any of you also lost your period lol
6167,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42173,8,I am years old and this is the first BC i have been on I started this pill to regulate my period my Gyno said it would help and this pill has minimum side effects I started this pill the second day of my period because it was a sunday thats what my gyno told me to do Any way i have been on it for a month now and i am still bleeding every day like i am on my second day of my period which is my heaviest day I have very bad crampscramps loss of appetite and lowered my sex drive tremendously I am married so that is a very inconvenient I honestly hate this pill because when i called my gyno they said give it months and thats its normal which i dont believe
6168,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42169,2,Had to get on it since they discontinued Loestrin Fe because it was supposedly the same ALL LIES It decreased my libido which is something that Ive never experienced before Loestrin was the best Id ever had Minastrin was also expensive Had to pay dollars a month for one pack Im off of it now and have the implan Nexplanon Ill see how this goes If this doesnt work out then Ill be finding another pill
6172,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42152,7,So far so good I recommend getting a few months of samples for anyone looking to try it out I have had NO side effects whatsoever and very light to minimal periods No longer having spottingbreakthrough bleeding or ovarian cysts Definitely recommend
6173,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42150,10,I have been taking minastrin for over a month now I loved it at first because there was no nausea I took it as soon as I got it to post pone my period for an upcoming cruise I read from reputable sources that it was fine My period was really heavy and lasted for days wtf I thought birth control was supposed to make them light I also had painful cramps days Again wtf Anyways Ive also noticed my vision isnt as sharp as it was before I started taking it and I most recently have had depressive thoughts I was never like this before I took this mess I wont be giving it time either This is awful
6174,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42142,10,I was on Generess FE for about years loved it and then could no longer afford it because it no longer had a activis card to use when paying for it So the doctor put me on Minastrin FE I believe this pill has made me gain a little bit of weight in a very short amount of time and my biggest concern is how it has effected me emotionally I feel very moody and so unhappy almost depressed I also have no sex drive which I am not sure if that is from the pill or the slight depression from the pill Either way it is just not working well with my body I Cant wait to switch off of this pill
6175,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,41785,16,I was on Loestrin for years with no problems but now I have acne which I havent had for yrs And missing periods and bad PMS and depression And my sex drive has dropped
6176,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,41781,13,Blemish acne and crying all the time thats what I got from Minastrin Fe
6180,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,41676,16,I was switched over to Minastrin Fe from Loestrin with no control over it At first I thought I was doing alright but no I am not Because at the age of my whole face is covered in blemishes and acne I have not had this problem since I was I have not changed anything that I am taking or any products that I am using or what I am eating This is the only change in my routine I am going to try to switch to something else
6182,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,41598,31,I was on Loestrin fe for years with NO PROBLEMS I loved it My periods lasted less than days cleared my skin and I didnt gain weight Then I was forced to switch to Minastrin which is supposedly the same pill but just chewable Its been a TERRIBLE experience Ive had a chronic yeast infection straight through the months Ive been on it and it wont respond to any prescription medication Ive also had severe cramps during my period and acne There is no way this medication is the same and I want Loestrin back
6183,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,41589,26,Like with everyone else was switched to this medication unknowingly I receive my birth control in a month supply and this last bulk included Minastrin packs I used Loestrin for a good years and had absolutely NO side effects Im halfway through my second pack of Minastrin and Ive been bleeding days every other week which isnt a huge deal more annoying than anything horrible lower back pain that will not cease Ive cried times just in the past few days over nonsense and have been in a generally depressed state I made sure there were no other stressors that couldve triggered this ridiculous emotional roller coaster and finally connected the dots and realized these symptoms presented after starting Minastrin
6184,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,41582,19,I was switched from Loestrin to this since it was discontinued and at first I was super nervous because it was chewable but I liked Loestrin so I went with it The first month was okay and it was exactly like Loestrin with nothing different The second month I was told by my doctor that I can skip the placebo pills to not have my period and I did just that The first week after doing so was great but then I started to spot I knew it would happen but its been going on consecutively for three weeks and its into the next pack now Its also caused mood swings headaches and I never get those vision blurriness here and there cramps bloating gassy all the upsetting side effects Overall not good and I may switch to another bc
6185,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42142,8,I was on Loestrin then switched to Minastrin I love both pills and have zero problems I used to be EXTREMELY hormonal without the pill and I first got on it to even me out emotionally The first pill I got on worked well but my body got used to it after a year so I had to switch I went to the shot and when I first started going to my obgyn the first thing she did was get me off the shot and onto Loestrin I love loestrinminastrin so much
6186,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42138,9,I havent had any problems with the new pill I had loestrin before they switched it over and I never had any problems with it then either If anything its made my period go away completely Ive been on both the old and new name combined for about years now The only thing thats changed is that theyve made the chewable option which taste nasty so I just swallow it
6187,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,42136,11,I am years old I have previously been on Loestrin FE then Generess FE My physician switched me to Minastrin and I have gained weight I am so lathargic and tired all of the time I am moody and overall unhappy which I have never had in my life I get cramps periodically and I get spotting at random times although very very light This is the most horrible pill I have ever been on I will be getting off of it immediately
6188,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,3,42133,9,Been on for about months Sex drive has been gone since starting Sex hurts if tried and Im very emotional constantly Gained a bunch of weight Havent had my period in months only some spotting
6189,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42131,17,I have been on Minastrin for over a year now My very first form of birth control The first months were tough to get through with spotting bloating mood swings etc But after my body got adjusted to the birth control everything has been perfect My periods are lighter and last days My cramps are still present but they arent as bad I dont have severe acne or weight gain Anyone who has a bad experience I say just give it time before you write it off as a terrible birth control
6190,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42129,11,Absolute worst pill ever I switched onto this pill bc I was having spotting and constant yeast infections on other pills Switched onto minastrin in early December Immediate weight gain Not lbs lbs I am an active female I work out times a week for miles I kept gaining weight no matter what No sex drive No period which is scary and a problem onto itself I was just switched to another pill to see if these side effects diminish Terrible pill pounds in months Not worth it Stay away
6191,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,7,42122,6,My DR started me on this pill months ago Im and have never been sexually active She started me on this pill because my PCOS made me not get a period in over a year My period came back on week of the pill then continued for weeks It was very heavy and painful but I guess thats what happens when you dont get one in months Things seem to be levelling out no in terms of side effects The first weeks I was an emotional trainwreck Ive gained a bit of weight but Im also on some new meds for my diabetes which could also be the cause The only really bad side effect are that my breasts are really tender Other than that its been great
6195,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,42091,9,I was on Minastrin Fe for nearly months During this time period I had horrible mood swings and I was constantly emotional My boyfriend said that I didnt seem like myself I also ended up gaining nearly pounds and had very tender breasts all the time I also would get awful cramps backaches and headaches during my periods My periods were very light though All in all Minastrin Fe was not for me I have now switched to Loestrin and I already feel so much better
6196,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42087,20,First and only birth control Ive been on Doctor recommended due to minimal side effects She stated it is supposed to be a chewable pill but that it could be also be swallowed So thats what Ive done I had light regular period before I got on it Now I randomly get a period maybe every or months
6197,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42073,29,I love this birth control I had lots of problems in the past but this one works for me I can successfully skip periods without spotting Miss the pill by an hour or so without spotting It did take about months for it all to level out for me No acne Breasts got a little bigger I dont get cramps very often at all and I havent noticed a change in my sex drive Everyones body is different but I think its worth trying for at least months before you decide
6198,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,4,42072,2,I was on a different pill before Minestrin that worked well but it was discontinued so my doctor switched me to Minestrin I was on Minestrin for about six months and just recently stopped I was having spotting and cramping every month I had bad mood swings each period Periods were very heavy and irregular I gained lbs even though I work out daysweek and watch my diet It worked as far as birth control but the side effects were too much for me Everyones body is different and this pill did not agree with me
6200,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,42056,11,This has worked great for me I only say because of something that has recently come up Im on my th pack of these pills and all of a sudden since Thursday of week its now Saturday Ive been spotting on and off which I thought would happen the first three months but its month and just starting now But otherwise my actual periods are almost nonexistent very light only lasting about days so this really works great for me
6203,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,42036,13,This is my first time on birth control so Im not comparing it to another brand I started taking this to help with my extremely heavy and painful periodsPros periods are or less days are extremely light I no longer experience horrible cramps just very minor aches I havent gotten pregnant only placebo pills compared to my skin cleared upCons My transition period was rough I spotted days the first two months I had extreme nausea the first month that killed my appetite I still have occasional nausea particularly at night but I no longer spot Only side effects Ive noticed It took care of my main problem though heavy painful periods so its been worth it I will stick to it
6204,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42021,20,This is my third month using this birth control I love it its amazing no bad side effects at all its serving it purpose
6206,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,42001,17,This is the first birth control Ive ever taken and Ive had a few mood swings at the same time Im still a teenager and hormones are flying everywhere so it doesnt truly bother me I used to have terrible periods where I would have to miss school for a few days at a time and immediately the medicine fixed it My period only occurs on the placebo days and is very light and with minor cramps that a few period relief pills help Last month I did feel very sick during my placebo days and Im sure its because I was taking it but not eating I was told that would happens so I advise you to always eat before taking it I also had terrible acne and it has cleared up immensely Overall its great for me
6209,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,5,41991,9,I started this pill as my first pill ever and it definitely helped with the intensity of my heavy bleeding issue prior to starting the pill However I noticed a lot of mood changes a decrease in sex drive weight gain lots of spotting and I never missed a pill I am switching to Beyaz now hoping to get better results
6210,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,41981,14,Like the others here I had been on Loestrin Fe for about six years before I was forced to switch to Minastrin because they discontinued it It was awful gave me horrible mood swings and I kept having huge fights with my boyfriend and everyone and I knew it was this pill because that is not like me at all As soon as I switched the mood swings went away
6211,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,41977,3,I recently started taking this birth control and after looking at the reviews I was very skeptical but I sure have learned that every body is different and will have a different acceptance to anything new I have no complains with this so far I wanted to write a review even though I have not been on it too long as sometimes one gets concerned on how it will make you feel in the beginning Well I have not felt mood swings cramping or overly emotional at all I have also not experienced any weight gain so far I started taking this on the first day of my menstrual cycle to increase its effectiveness
6212,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,41969,41,I have tried many birth control pills and this is the only one I felt normal on Although I have stopped getting my period my doctor says this is normal I have no other side effects at all
6214,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,41947,13,Ive been on birth control pills for years now After I had my daughter I started to have consecutive problems of urinary infection because my doctor decided to switch my pill to something that would not affect my breast milk After I tried many different kinds of pills and other ways of contraception I was finally given the Loestrin which changed my quality of life No more urinary infections which made my sex life and consequently my marriage much better Never noticed major side effects Then when I had to switch to Minastrin everything was the same as great as with Loestrin
6215,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,41941,7,I started my very st birth control after i had my daughter My dr had perscribed Minastrin fe to me and it worked amazingly At first I hated chewing it but im used to it now months in My periods are only days and are very light I am so happy with this borth control and wouldnt even think about switching it out You ladies need to get past the st three months and youll be good to go
6218,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,41925,14,I have tried so many different birth control pills for so long and could never find the right one Then tried Minastrin Fe Im very pleased with it It does make me a little more hungry But I am aware its only a side effect and ignore any extra appetite I may feel In general its a good pill
6219,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,41919,18,I have been on Minastrin Fe for months now I wasnt on any birth control previously I have not noticed any weight gainif anything Ive noticed a decrease in my appetite I do have slight headaches daily but not anything Tylenol cant fix and they are slowly subsiding They were pretty brutal in the first month The biggest side effect Ive noticed is how emotional I am I used to NEVER cry and now if my boyfriend even looks at me the wrong way I start crying Its ridiculous Sometimes I feel like Im about to cry and I have absolutely no idea why Also my periods are lighter and shorter but I still have a little spotting Doctor told me this would happen Ill keep taking it for now
6220,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,9,41913,32,I tried several different birth control medicines before my doctor prescribed Minastrin Fe On other pills particularly Viorele I felt very emotional and uncomfortable While taking Minastrin I feel like myself and I have had no weight gain Minastrin has caused me to stop getting my period but my doctor says that this is completely normal
6221,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,41906,28,I started this pill and have noticed serious changes Moodiness very snappy depressed thinking negative Although I dont feel nauseous or dizziness
6222,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,41895,50,Ive just recently started taking Minastrin I havent even made it through the first packet and Im noticing side effects Ive had severe back pain and mild mood swings I want to cry all the time amp its affecting my relationship I get mad at my boyfriend for every single thing he does amp I was not like that at all before Ive been a very angry and depressed person since taking it
6223,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,41892,23,Terrible headaches heavy bleeding throughout the month Awful experience
6224,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,41888,24,I was browsing the web looking for reviews for contraceptive options due to the fact that it is hard for me to remember to take the pill everyday I have been on LoestrinMinastrin for years now and I have loved it I was put on this birth control my first day at the gyno as a test pack to see if the pill was right for me I fell in love with fact that you only had to have your period four days a month so I was sold The only time I wasnt on this pill is when my pharmacy accidentally prescribed me the generic brand but it was an easy fix For anyone who wants to try it I encourage them to do so It has been awesome for me I never seemed to have any problems with it
6225,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,41870,13,This is the first birth control I have ever been on and its awful I only gave it a because it does what its suppose to Ive been on the pill for months The first three months I had severe acne Ive never had an acne problem until then Spotting is a severe problem I have to wear pads majority of the time two weeks at the most with no spotting Periods are very irregular one day Im good the next few days Im not Ive experienced mood swings and cramping Not a good experience at all
6227,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,10,41865,26,Im rating it a for effectiveness because it does what its does Its birth control First month some cramping during period only normal bleedingyet lasted days no headaches hormonal jawline acne cleared right up Got my period irregularly stillsecond month no cramps no headaches hormonal acne still gone somewhat still fighting steady acne yet its MUCH better gained a few pounds breasts got noticeably larger especially for my boyfriend Got my period on the first brown pill Im looking forward to month Hope this helped
6228,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,41853,8,I used to take the regular combined pill and would OFTEN get terrible migraines with black auras It was really scary Now that Im on this for a mini pill I really havent gotten them I never took any other mini pill but this is way better for me than all the reg pills My periods are SO much lighter and shorter Yes I have gained weight and emotional sensitivity But now that I know they are just side effects I know I can deal with them I would take this over the scary migraine and heavy fainting periods anytime I really think it depends on the individual how you like it Also I really think you need to chew it like it says I read somewhere that the enzymes in your saliva or stomach or whatever need to break it down properly
6230,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,6,41820,22,Was on for months or so It was ok I didnt have any of the quotcommonquot side affects and my mood was good My period was light with minimal cramps and PMS But I lost my libido completely and felt that I gained more weight on my thighs and cellulite despite eating healthy and working out never had this problem previously I am having the IUD Skyla put in tomorrow My doctor said that this should be quotitquot Minastrin may work for other women but the no sex drive and Weight gain was enough for me to throw in the towel
6231,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,2,41815,35,Ive never been on birth control until now Im at the end of my first month of Minastrin and its been an awful experience It caused so many relationship issues for me due to the fact that it makes me an emotional mess I cry all of the time and find myself angry and searching for something ridiculous to blame it on My breasts got larger and although I havent noticed any weight gain I have noticed headaches and nausea Im about to cry right now and I have no idea why
6232,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,41815,21,Ive been on Minastrin for months now The first were horrible I had every possible side effect bloating mood swings sore chest acne spotting you name it About my fourth month my body got adjusted and I now love it No spotting mood swings and my acne has subsided For those who are just now on it push through
6233,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,8,41802,15,I was switched to Minastrin from Loestrin just like everyone else But unlike most I am doing great on it I was taking Loestrin for over years and loved it Minastrin has been the same for me no unusual side effects at all No acne which I had when I was a teenager and still use Proactiv for No unusual headaches or bleeding etc I rated it an only because I dont like chewing it its gross tasting but works good for me so Im sticking with it
6234,Minastrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,1,41795,18,I have taken Loestrin Fe for the last four years Because of its discontinuation I was told by my doctor to begin taking the chewable contraceptive Minastrin Fe instead After taking this pill for months I have found myself irritated and miserable over the smallest inconveniences The acne that I had treated and somewhat cured is now back and annoying as ever I am switching pills ASAP I want Loestrin back

6236,Comtan,Parkinsons Disease,8,42836,1,I just started taking this drug about weeks ago The first week was a little rough and it leaves a funny taste in my mouth However now that I am getting used to it I find it helpful I can take less CarbidopaLevodopa and has much smoother transition between endbegin of medication times ONE THING I HAVE FOUND is the importance of staying hydrated Dehydration is a side effect and it shows If I dont watch it I start feeling bad amp symptoms flare up After I drink a large glass of water I start feeling better
6238,Comtan,Parkinsons Disease,1,40337,9,Terrible hallucinations
6239,Comtan,Parkinsons Disease,9,39566,13,The medication is very good Unfortunately it is expensive

6252,Gralise,Postherpetic Neuralgia,7,41434,43,I have had this condition for years now and no diagnosis as why its happening Epidurals narcotics Tramadol Lyrica dont seem to work for the quotpainful tinglesquot Gabapentin helps with that but my pain is still acute The numbness over my right rib cage is nearly unbearable doctors want to ease the pain but no one wants to find out WHY Plus they are not very good at easing the pain Now they want to put a neural stimulator in me and if its anything like a TENS machine all it will do is irritate me I will not go off the Gabapentin until my diagnosis The side effect of not being able to remember words really bothers me
6253,Gralise,ibromyalgia,9,41374,131,After decades on pain meds they are working less and less In addition to fibromylgia I have bulging and herniated discs neuropathy and controlled epilepsy I have learned to live with constant pain My Doc suggested Gralise gabapentin and said that he felt confident I would see good results I am AMAZED I saw immediate improvement in my ability to walk and move around I am experiencing considerably less pain I am concerned because my insurance will not cover the brand which is time released that I am taking and it is expensive but I remain optimistic and I will try the times a day dosages I have not felt this good in many years

6265,Monodox,Acne,6,40661,5,I have acne and I used this product Monodox did not clear my acne however it did keep it from flaring and becoming worse I am no longer using this medication but I guess my experience was okay
6268,Monodox,Acne,2,40403,6,I took Monodox for days and I had to stop because it made me so nauseous One night I actually threw up I dont know if it was because I take birth control too but either way its not something I would do again
6270,Monodox,Acne,4,39944,19,I starting taking Monodox to help with a acne breakout It worked within days and started drying out my acne but after weeks I stopped because it was irritating my stomach to much My face was pretty cleared up but not perfect I was supposed to be on it for a month The weirdest thing was the day after I stopped the drug I began have extreme static electricity in my hair I still have it and it has been days I Googled to see what it could be and found that people who are on Accutane have experienced the same I hope it goes away it is very irritating
6271,Monodox,Acne,10,39858,36,tried a few other brands first by had terrible nausea and couldnt hold them down this is the only one i could tolerate and along with a topical that my doctor prescribed me my acne really cleared up
6273,Ocella,Birth Control,8,42992,0,Ive been on birth control since I was now Ive tried birth controls before Ocella All previous ones had break through bleeding mood swings amp one gave me out of control yeast infections Thats when I switched to Ocella zero acne I skip my period no breakthrough bleeds no weight gain besides pounds and a little bloating every so oftenBest part no pregnancy scares for the last years Love the protection and stability its supplied I will say Ive experience intermittent anxiety on it might try another kind of it continuesHope this helped Worth a try its kept me safe happy and acnepregnancy free
6276,Ocella,Birth Control,6,42900,0,I was prescribed birth control about years ago due to complications from ovarian cysts The very first one I tried was loestrin which made me incredibly nauseas I then tried a couple other ones but they all made me nauseous as well Finally I was prescribed ocella I felt pretty good on it Didnt notice any weight changes My skin looked AMAZING I would just get bad migrainesnauseassick a day or two before my period and some days randomly during the monthIt wasnt until I STOPPED taking ocella or any birth controllong storynot sexually active at the moment about months ago that made me realize how much better I feel off of it I feel like a new person My mood is x better Sex drive is back Only down side my skin
6278,Ocella,Birth Control,10,42893,5,I was prescribed to this birth control but after reading the awful reviews I was seriously considering going back to the doctor to ask for another I decided to give it a try and Ive had absolutely no side effects This is my first time taking birth control and it really worked perfect for me I usually have a lot of acne and that has cleared up a lot already which is a big plus Dont be discouraged with the other reviews it might work for you too
6281,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,7,42774,2,Im a lesbian so I dont take this to prevent pregnancy but because my periods were lasting two weeks before Pros my periods are regular and lighter and my skin is completely clear Cons I originally gained around pounds which I have since lost and I have no sex drive whatsoever My breast size also increased from a D to a G which I guess could be seen as a positive or negative I personally find it frustrating I am also very emotional but I think thats just part of my personality and unrelated to the birth control
6282,Ocella,Birth Control,6,42772,2,I take Ocella to help control my PCOS and as a birth control Its done a good job of regulating my period and as a birth control However Ive experienced many mood swings and depressivelike symptoms as well as more nausea and tenderness in my breasts It does what it needs to do which is why Im reluctant to switch since it is one of the best birth controls to regulate my PCOS symptoms
6283,Ocella,Birth Control,10,42768,5,I LOVE this pill I was on Jolessa for years and always had constant spotting and bad acne Sprintec for months and had spotting and awful mood swings and periods but Ocella is absolutely perfect Ive been on it for months now and its cleared up most of my acne Ive had no spotting and no periods and Ive lost pounds No mood swings either I would definitely recommend that anyone who is considering this pill give it a try Plus mine is only a month For the work it does it is awesome I cannot speak on effectiveness for pregnancy prevention as I use it to skip periods and am not sexually active
6284,Ocella,Birth Control,2,42744,7,I have been taking Ocella for about a year now It has controlled my breakthrough bleeding but the last few months Ive been experiencing EXTREME mood swings depression anxiety angerrage I dont know myself FriendsFamily notice too I am stopping this pill today I have a call in to my OB I feel like Im going crazy
6286,Ocella,Birth Control,3,42736,2,Was an effective form of birth control and cleared up my acne spectacularly however I started getting horrible migraines during the week I was not taking the hormones My hands and left side of my face would go numb I would get nauseous and I would be incapable of doing anything but lie there because I could not fall asleep because of the pain
6287,Ocella,Acne,10,42731,4,I am years old and started breaking out severely a few years back I tried every OTC acne medication and cleanser I finally went to the dermatologist and was diagnosed with hormonal acne I was prescribed Ocella and tretinoin cream Ive been using both since April however I noticed that as long as I take my Ocella everyday I do not need the tretinoin cream so I havent used it in a couple months My skin is such much better and I have to remember to take my pill every day because the hormones wear off after hours and Ill break out if I miss it two days in a row Otherwise this medication has been heaven sent
6288,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,2,42712,1,I was on Ocella for about years for PCOS Worked great Then I got off for about years and was regular Had a miscarriage early and went back on it It has been horrible this time around Horrible cramps heavy breakthrough bleeding that starts the second week and lasts until about days b period starts I have been taking since Jan and it is now Dec and never improved Gyno switched me to sprintec Fingers crossed
6289,Ocella,Birth Control,6,42682,4,Did what it was supposed to do ie I didnt get pregnant and I was sexually active the whole time I was on it Also I dont believe I had the single zit for the whole year and a half I was on it NiceHoweverI experienced a lot of very annoying headaches while taking Ocella They were stubborn too wouldnt go away if I took an Aleeve Also weight gain definitely happened I went up full cup sizes and quotfilled outquot in general I would say about lbs or so With little to no change in my diet lifestyleAlso I feel that Ocella increased my anxiety and depression It also affected my sex drive and level of lubrication Everyones body is different hard to say if symptoms were from Ocella or unrelated
6290,Ocella,Birth Control,10,42678,2,Mild nausea when I first started but that has gone away Cleared my skin a lot which was a surprise and so far Ive grown two cup sizes No weight gain or loss and allows me to completely skip my period by starting a new pack rather than taking placebos Only downside is mild mood swings but nothing unmanageable Definitely better than tri previfem
6292,Ocella,Birth Control,6,42625,10,I have taken Ocella for almost eight years and loved it It improved my acne mood swings etc I didnt really have any noticeable side effects However in the last few months I started getting all over body itching and then hives I eventually realized going off of this cured my itchinghives so I decided to write this review incase anyone else is dealing with these symptoms Generics can change filler ingredients at any time so unfortunately I will no longer be taking this pill
6293,Ocella,Birth Control,4,42622,0,I started this method about months ago I hate it No change in acne but weight gain headaches horrible heavy crampy periods intense mood swings Im switching soonOn the good side Im not pregnant so yay there and I know exactly when Hell Week last days always starts and ends
6297,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,1,43042,0,Took this x and developed wheezing coughing and flu like symptoms with a fever Had to use rescue inhaler just to get my lungs open Will not be using again definitely not worth the side effects
6298,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,7,43003,2,Dulera is working great on my breathing and helping me cough up excess mucus but my pain level in the parts of my body that have osteoarthritis seems to have increased I know my blood pressure is up so my doctor did add another blood pressure thats helping take care of that I just am in pain wherever I have osteoarthritis has anyone else experienced this
6299,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,1,43000,3,Ive been on and off Dulera for several years After using it regularly for a month or two I invariably get a lowlevel infection in my lungsbronchial tubes Major yellowtobrown phlegm constantly coughingThen when I go off Dulera after a few days the infection selfcures and the phlegm and coughing subside But then of course the asthma comes backFor me theres no magic solution yet Ill probably not use Dulera any more too afraid of the infections it encourages
6300,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,10,42971,1,I have probably spent this year due to hospital co pays I was put on dulera and it has completely stopped my wheezing I just wish I didnt need medicine to breathe
6302,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,6,42955,4,It has worked well to control my asthma but after several years it immediately causes me to lose my voice making unattractive squeaky sounds
6305,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,1,42868,13,I took Dulera for about months After a month I experienced heart palpitations heart rate from to in seconds At first it would only last minutes Then palpitations lasted over an hour then two hours Ended up in the ER four times twice to receive an IV drug to reset and slow my heart beat Cardiologist at the hospital put me on Diltiazem to control my heart rate It lowered blood pressure was already good but did not stop heart palpitations Began having breathing problems and doctor increased Diltiazem dosage Experienced worse breathing issues and loss of bladder control Finally realized the Diltiazem caused breathing problems and Dulera was causing the racing heart palpitations Nightmare
6306,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,10,42837,3,a very good product it worksshame that the company has jacked the price up so much that its no longer affordablegreed is a very bad thing
6307,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,9,42627,12,Had infrequent asthma all my life I am but never had to use an inhaler regularly After a cold turned into pneumonia plus a sinus infection my doc said to use my ProAir HFA inhaler more often But serious asthma had set in and I wasnt getting relief Burning sensation in lungs difficulty breathing no energy was not resting wellyou guys know the drill After two puffs of Dulera the burning sensation was reduced lungs felt more relaxed and I could breathe more deeply I slept better last night and awoke feeling restedwow After two puffs this morning at am I felt the burning completely subside Feel so much better Even sinus pressure reduced Looking forward to feeling good again Hope is in sight
6308,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,9,42514,3,Ive had asthma ever since I quit smoking Ive quit twice and each time after years the asthma kicks in bad Ive tried everything and am now on Dulera which helped tremendously My insurance wouldnt cover it for one inhaler Found PAN online and they are taking care of the cost If not for PAN I would not be able to take Dulera However after several months on this med my teeth starting rotting very quickly My dentist said he only sees this kind of deterioration in chemo patients and someone who hasnt brushed in years Ive had two teeth pulled already and another is scheduled to be pulled Also started with thrush a day ago and today I can barely move my tongue Yes Ive been rinsing
6309,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,4,42507,8,Took Dulera for a year for pretty bad asthma which it controlled very nicelyAfter one year the Dulera started giving me awful palpitationssevere pounding pulse shakiness and insomniaI had to give it upI feel better now after weeks without itbut still cannot find a good replacement
6310,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,1,42494,13,Been on Dulera for about weeks had to go to the ER due to muscle spasm Not worth it I have also gained weight Might help with breathing but every muscle in my body is having spasm
6312,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,2,42461,7,The weight gain was not worth it I quit My asthma is moderate not at all severe and my doc put me on Dulera SIngulair after days of steroids Then added Spiriva and now Breo Ridiculous I quit them all except Breo which I dont even take every day because my breathing is not obstructed or difficult But during Dulera and Singluar I gained FIFTEEN POUNDS in months which I have never done in my entire life Im in my late s
6313,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,8,42434,13,I just took the first puff minutes ago I dont want to chant victory but I am breathing much better One thing I need to tell anyone whos using asthma inhalers that after using it you always have to rinse your mouth to avoid oral thrush I got this medicine from a pulmonologist I was referred to after I couldnt control my asthma and went into acute bronquitis three months in a rowTen more minutes passed and Im actually breathing No shakes no fainting no shortness of breathI feel like Im calming downThe one thing Im always afraid is corticoids because of their side effects but if I can feel this well I will try to watch my weight and take more calcium for osteoporosis OMG I feel so good
6314,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,10,42370,4,so far its helping out pretty well
6315,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,10,42345,16,I acquired adult asthma at age I was using a rescue inhaler at least times per day and was having a hard time sleeping due to increased nasal discharge and asthma symptoms Literally choking at night Dr put me on the Dulera recommended dose of mg puffs times per day I was out of my mind hyper although I could instantly breath better I dropped the dose down to puff early in the day and the Dr said that it was fine as long as I felt it was helping Its been months I feel amazing I no longer wake at night My sinuses are no longer dripping I breath easier and Ive lost lbs because my activity level has increased now that I can breath I have not needed a rescue inhaler once Amazing for my needs
6316,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,5,42160,10,Dulera works for my asthma but it seems to be causing some weight gain
6317,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,8,42051,14,I have been using this for almost years Better control of symptoms I can usually use puff x a day except when I get a bug then I need the prescribed x a day However last weeks I have a very medicine tasting phlegmexhaled air
6318,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,1,41988,39,I developed severe calf and back thigh cramps at night after the first use The allergist said that only about of users develop leg cramps but I dont see this mentioned at all in the side effects
6319,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,9,41917,27,Dulera works great and I have noticed it has improved my breathing by It seems to work better than my rescue inhaler Down side of it is that I have gotten infections in the tonsils and sinusitis Also Ive been having blood clots in my mucus and when I cough I phlegm I notice its a dark brown reddish color Frequent migraines and insomnia some nights Feeling of unconsciousness when laying down
6320,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,7,41889,16,I only use Dulera once a day and only one puff but I do this every single day usually just before I go to bed On occasion I will need a second puff during the day after I wake up I occasionally get the pain in the side and lower back but it does not last long I have many of the side effects but I had them long before I started using Dulera The pain is a new one though
6321,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,8,41710,37,I have been an asthmatic for most of my life I am now yrs old and have tried many medications Before I lost my insurance I was on singulair and claritin and still struggling Several times I woke up gasping for air So when I was able to get insurance again I requested to try something else since I was hesitant to say the least in taking singulair again My Dr suggested I try Dulera and Flonase Since starting these medications I have not needed my albuterol inhaler once and its been about a month I went from using my inhaler sometimes several times a day to not at all My mom has osteoporosis excuse the spelling and that concerns me for my own health but my breathing is ultimately more important
6323,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,1,43049,2,After using for one month noticed cloudy vision runny nose sore throat joint pain and general fatigue Finally realized all these side effects were from the drops and stopped using them All above mentioned side effects began to abate after hours This stuff is poison People donrsquot usually think that eye drops affects anything other than eyes They are wrong Very wrong
6324,Latanoprost,Intraocular Hypertension,9,42791,13,Originally diagnosed with Glaucoma had laser eye surgery but over the years eye pressures increased and prescribed Xalatan Latanoprost no significant problems But when chemist swapped for a generic make years ago I had problems feeling queasy palpitations waterworks weakness generally not feeling well Changed prescription immediately back to Xalatan no problem This happened again yesterday given generic Latanoprost and thought I would give it a further try big mistake terrible nights sleep and will be going back to pharmacist immediately for change back to Xalatan But if I had a choice I would not take any of these drugs all very powerful
6326,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,1,42668,19,I have been taking this eye drop for years When it went generic it was ok for the first few years My pharmacist gets different generic brandsseems some brands are different than otherssome burn the crap out of my eyesOne thing I will say about this drugI have had a sore throat for the last yearsI continually sneezea lot of sinus problems stuffy nosesometimes even drips water like drippings when I bend over I hate this I have asked my eye dr amp he sayswellit should not cause a sore throathello it most certainly does I think it even causes blurred vision I dont like these eye dropsbut I dont want to go blind
6328,Latanoprost,Intraocular Hypertension,10,42629,9,Im absolutely content with this drug Originally my doctor prescribed me latanoprost and ive been sick quickly I had a severe sore throat and my eyes were strongly red all the time after just days of using it Than I came back and I told about all side effects After that conversation my doctor prescribed me Xalatan and I am really content now Its my third week of using it and i dont have any side effects No sore throat no headache no weakness no muscle pain no redness My eyes were just a little bit red at the beggining but now they are all ok
6329,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,3,42610,10,Second time on this eye drop First time for a few days I stopped taking because it made me feel physically sick Second time I gave it a go for almost weeks i got so sick i went to the Dr with flu like symptoms waking up with phlegm in my throat joint pain extreme sweating and the feeling like Im about to faint OMG it really scared me so i stopped it and now Im back to normal still have eye problems but that is better than the solutions which is taking that eye drops It is very dangerous
6330,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,8,42545,4,Very effective at first but I maybe coming off this and going onto something elseIt seems my eyes have a mind of their own and outfox the medications and I cycle through different meds to reduce eye pressureIt feels like I have an object in my eye sometimes after putting the drops in Passes soon enough
6331,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,1,42519,11,After taking a week of drops experienced joint and muscle pain At two weeks chest pains sent me to the hospital They kept me for two days until pain subsided and extensive tests were done and it was determined I did not have any blockages I will not take it again
6332,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,8,42442,16,I am in my s and I have glaucoma with very high eye pressure My doctor considered surgery but decided to try latanoprost first I am so glad he did because these drops work very well to lower my eye pressure They dont make my eyes burn like some of the other drops that my doctor used to prescribe Also they keep my eyes from being red in the morning and they keep me from getting pressure headaches The primary negative is that I will have to use them for the rest of my life
6333,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,5,41444,37,After months on the med I am having problem of discomfort in one eye Feels like foreign body Cannot use latanoprost two days straight as left eye feels like I have something in it I am seeing doctor tomorrow Hope he can fix the problem
6334,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,10,40695,66,I have been on this medication for over years with no side effects and it has lowered my eye pressure I rate this medication more favorably than Betoptic which I was previously on which was less effective and always left a stain on my faceeye area after it dried
6335,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,10,40574,64,So far so good It has decreased the pressure No negative issues I actually like the way it feels on the eyes
6336,Latanoprost,Intraocular Hypertension,6,40478,39,It does make your eyelashes grow but mine started growing on the inner corners of my eye and under my eye I got the sensation of something in my eye usually it was the overabundance of lashes My eyes got dry and the drops sting
6337,Latanoprost,Intraocular Hypertension,9,40065,57,Im doing just fine but then again I have a high tolerance for most things Also would much rather have a little burning than blindness
6338,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,5,40018,89,I seem to be having a lot of irritation and eyes are watering constantly also very blood shot Hope this all passes
6341,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,2,41571,31,I am my second day and just took my evening dose I seriously thought I was dying The second the medicine hit my lungs I could not breath It took all I could do to find my rescue inhaler This was just now the most frightening experience I have ever had with an RX I am still shaking as I type this Beware I read this as a side affect Rarejust make sure you have your rescue inhaler close to you Done with this RX
6342,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,5,41571,31,Dulera works pretty well do not need to use my rescue inhaler as often but the one main downside is that it continuously causes me to have sinuitis which then causes a migraine I have always had bad problems with my sinuses so am definately reconsidering continuing using this product
6344,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,10,41443,34,Ive been asthmatic for the past years During the last months or so my asthma has really gotten out of control to the point where I was borderline abusing my rescue inhaler a average of times per day I recently started working out again and within minutes of light to moderate power walking on the treadmill I would have to rush back to the car overwhelmed with wheezing a tight sensation in my chest my head pounding struggling to take a breath gasping for air I finally had enough and decided to be proactive and see a allergist He checked my vital signs and realized that a had lingering wheeze and gave me a sample of Dulera two puffs daily This is a miracle
6345,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,9,41425,28,Ive used this twice now and it has been great Much better than similar inhalers I had pneumonia that was not resolving and this was prescribed within two days I had dramatic improvement nd time I had sudden asthmatic flare and was crashing not resolving well same thing within days dramatic improvement Downside it makes me very shaky for a short duration maybe up to hours Seems to increase the appetite slightly Also a slightly foggy headed feel but fades soon Mind you this is in conjunction with oral steroids so some effects might be less if the others were removed I would gladly use this again for a serious asthma flare that was not resolving
6346,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,2,41393,29,I was just prescribed Dulera today and noticed that my lungs felt slightly better immediately however it has been only hours since I used the inhaler and my hands are shaking like I have low blood sugar
6347,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,1,40968,28,My year old son took Dulera for asthma In the weeks that he took it he dropped from lbs to lbs He was tired all of the time to the point that he had to lay down often He is usually active all of the time
6348,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,10,40960,41,No asthma systems since using this medicine
6349,Formoterol / mometasone,moterol / mometasone,5,40934,27,Doctor had me try this instead of just increasing the dosage of Asmanex I was taking Dulera is a combination of Asmanex with something else and that added component did NOT do well with me
6354,Monodox,Acne,10,42574,17,My daughter had had horrible acne for years Nothing has worked tried everything except birth control pills She had her wisdom teeth pulled and was prescribed this and within days her face was clear Totally amazing Shocked to find such a simple solution that has not given her any side effects
6357,Monodox,Acne,9,41855,77,My year old daughter started on this weeks ago Week we saw no change Week the acne was significantly worse the medicine paper warns that this may happen As soon as week started like magic her face started to clear We are happy with the results and hopeful for continued improvement
6358,Monodox,Acne,10,41793,37,This completely made every zit I had disappear BUT it makes me feel very sick Depends on which outweighs the other but it did work for acne
6359,Monodox,Acne,10,41781,33,I have had bad acne since the th grade During my senior year in high school I was put on Accutane which worked for the duration of time that I was on it moderately mild breakouts but the redness went away a huge step up from my ridiculous acne but returned in moderation when I went to college in the fall I waited until the spring to visit my dermatologist and she put me on two facial creams and Monodox I tried the facial creams alone didnt work Then tried Monodox and within a week I saw a huge difference Not only did my acne almost disappear but my breakouts were mild small pimples that went away leaving no scars in days I have been on it about months and I couldnt be happier My face is clear Highly recommend
6361,Monodox,Acne,10,41681,20,It made me nauseous but not too bad I love this medicine Cleared up my cystic pimples within days Im also on tretinoin cream which my insurance also pays My dermatologist is amazing for recommending both I get compliments that my face is flawless It feels great You will get little flare ups here and there dont give up give the medicine a chance it will work I recommend it
6362,Monodox,Rosacea,10,41655,28,I developed Rosacea when I was pregnant with my first child at age I never had skin issues before even as a teenager I finally went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Papulopustular Rosacea acne plus redness My doctor prescribed Monodox and it has worked WONDERS Within a week almost all the pimplesbumps were gone GONE I only hope that once I finish up the medication days it wont all come back The downside is the cost Thankfully my doctor gave me a discount card from the manufacturer that allows me to buy it for per month Otherwise it was for day supply
6363,Monodox,Acne,9,41371,30,Day of Monodox my acne is starting to clear up Im on mg x a day Sinus stuffinessdrainage diahrrhea muscle weakness and a headache when I run too hard Ive read really good things about this medicine thats why I opted to fill my prescription SUPER EXPENSIVE without insurance and a discount card my Dr gave me Hope the side effects subside
6364,Monodox,Acne,10,41324,27,I am and have been taking Monodox for a few weeks It is working great with no side effects Solodyn also worked great for me but had so many side effects that I had to stop taking it I am also using a topical with retinal In my s I took Accutane which worked for about years Started getting cystic acne again in my late s I am very pleased with this medicine
6365,Monodox,Acne,8,41283,17,Have been on it for a month age Also use RetinA and Acyanya Works very well Very happy with results No side effects
6367,Monodox,Acne,2,41226,15,It was fine at first but about halfway through the month it gave me intense nausea so bad I couldnt go to work or even stand up without throwing updry heaving It wasnt even great for my acne It stopped a little bit of my acne bad flareups but I still had constant pimples all over my chin At pretty much the same rate as Id had before
6368,Monodox,Acne,8,41204,16,I started taking Monodox four days ago and I already can see a difference I am years old and I didnt have acne on my teenage years none About a year ago I started breaking out more and more I thought it was stress then my nutrition then an allergy I tried everything you can imagine from homemade remedies to recently I bought the Murad acne kit which helped a little bit I did facial and it made it worse so I decided to visit a dermatologist and he gave me Monodox and Atralin for night time and aczone for morning So far I havent broken out and I hope this really helps
6369,Monodox,Acne,10,41138,21,I had terrible acne this summer But now I take Monodox twice a day as soon as I wake up then I take the second pill after I workout in the evening It has never made me nauseous as it has others And I get nauseous from vitamins So Im shocked that Monodox doesnt make me sick The only side effect I experience is more frequent trips to the bathroom My skin is currently pimple freenow to just conquer the acne scars
6370,Monodox,Acne,10,41087,11,Monodox is awesome Not only did it only cost with their savings card but also works so well I had taken Doryx before but couldnt tolerate it at all I got a rash and extreme nausea mg but now I started taking mg of Monodox in the evening with dinner and not only do I not have the rash or nausea but I also dont have the photosensitivity Plus the Doryx pill was HUGE These capsules are so small and easy to swallow If you take the Monodox mg you can either spread the dosing or take it all at once whatever works best for you But for me the mg is perfect I should note I also started using Ziana at night as I couldnt tolerate any of the benzoyl peroxide topicals And starting tonight I will also add Aczone as a primer
6371,Monodox,Acne,7,40892,19,I am years old and before Monodox I was on Minocycline for almost two years and it worked tremendously until about two months ago My old breakouts came back much stronger and my dermatologist said that I had gained tolerance for the medicine I continue to use benzaclin but I am now using Monodox It seemed to work well at first although the doctor told me it would take about weeks I just finished my second week Although I do still have breakouts certain spots on my face feel very clean and have healing acne scars Hopefully the rest of the breakout will clear up in this coming week but otherwise I have not experienced any side effects mentioned such as nausea or dizziness
6373,Monodox,Acne,9,40880,11,I have been taking Monodox for around a month along with Duac gel bp clindamycin at night and Atralin tretinoin gel in the morning While I can say that this antibiotic is definitely working I have one complaint My skin is seriously oily now SERIOUSLY oily I mean I need to use around oil absorbing sheets a day Ive gone through or packs of oil sheets But this works It really has helped to eliminate large pimples Occasionally a large one will occur but its usually now smaller red specks or an occasional white head I am told in another month I can see more results and I hope that it happens because if it does my skin will be clear
6374,Monodox,Acne,3,40859,11,I have been taking Monodox with Epiduo a topical acne creme for a little less than a month and it has helped clear up most of my big pimples but I have not seen much improvement in the small under the skin bumps I expected to see better results by now but I am trying to be patient and give it a few months to work before I completely write it off
6375,Monodox,Acne,8,40832,6,I have been on Monodox for a little under a month I take it at night with my dinner and I use a topical medication before bed My skin has definitely improved although not to the point where I feel like I dont need makeup Any large or cystic pimples are gone and I havent gotten any since but I do have some mild scarring left that hopefully will go away I am still suffering from small under the skin white heads that are on my forehead and right cheek although they have lessened in the number of them there are still plenty left
6376,Monodox,Acne,8,40826,15,I am and was prescribed Monodox with a topical creme quotVeltinquot and have been on them for almost a week So far I have seen small improvements and I will post another update either when it completely clears or at the end of the month One thing is for sure though is that it works x better than anything else After I take the medicine Around dinner time I can feel my pores clearing up By the way I have what is called quotModerate or Mild Cystic Acne Hope this helps and thanks for all that have posted already
6378,Monodox,Acne,9,40711,26,Im taking Monodox and using Tretinoin Ive only been using both for a week now but I can say Im already seeing improvements I had initial breakouts which is normal and I used to get really nauseous and throw up from taking Monodox BUT I guess I completely forgot that my dermatologist told me to take Monodox with food Trust me that makes a world of a difference Im really excited to see where my skin is going to be in a few weeks because my acne is really clearing up and all thats left are the red spots REMEMBER take it with food
6379,Ocella,Birth Control,9,42587,12,Been on this for a year and so far its helped me lose lbs which anybody that knows or experiences PCOS knows its hard as heck to lose any weight Its helped the unwanted body hair go away for the most part and my periods come every month and are usually between days compared to once every months and being at least weeks long before I started this birth control The hair on my head grows fuller and faster and the facial hair is almost completely gone I suggest this birth control to anybody that experiences PCOS or symptoms like it
6380,Ocella,Birth Control,6,42577,1,Took Ocella for years It cleared up my acne and helped a lot with period cramps I never got pregnant and was sexually active the whole time BUT I gained an insane amount of weight with little change to my diet or exercise I gained about pounds during that time and was super bloated with a lot of fluid retention Looking back on photos I can tell when I was on it by how bloated my face looked vs when I went off Didnt notice much change in sex drive which is good Probably wont use again
6382,Ocella,Birth Control,3,42554,0,I started taking Ocella in March of It was the very first time I tried birth control and I am years of age I got on birth control because I am in a serious relationship but I am not ready for children and I wanted something to help me with my bad cramps and vomiting on the first days of my period During the first week after my period I experienced breakthrough bleeding for about a month Things were fine until I began having yeast infections The first that I just thought ok it just a yeast infection However I began to consistently experience them at least every month since then Im thinking of switching the pill as soon as I can to see if that helps Besides this unrelenting side effects my breasts have become larger
6383,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,10,42531,4,I must say Ocella has been nothing short of a miracle for me In just months my facial hair has deminished I went from shavingwaxing plucking EVERYDAY to not seeing any hairs on my face for days now My very heavy painful periods are already normal and I have lost lbs I have had no side effects I hope this continues for the long term
6384,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,1,42529,2,I am currently taking ocella and ever since Ive been taking ocella my cramps have been worse and my mistral cycles are heavy and long
6385,Ocella,Birth Control,1,42497,5,I used ocella years ago and it was great at first My cramps werent as painful or etc but then I started getting severe stomach pain and guess what I found out I had gallstones due to Ocella and had to have my gallbladder removed when I was and Im now So if any ladies experience stomach pain on the right side you might have gallstones due to this pill
6386,Ocella,Birth Control,5,42492,0,Im not even all the way through my first pack and I have a love hate relationship with Ocella My docs gave me this medication to prevent future cysts I had a cm and two cm cysts existent since birth I have spotting EVERY DAY I cant tell when my period started
6387,Ocella,Birth Control,10,42397,5,I have been on this birth control for years now I take it for acne birth control menstrual disorder premenstrual dysphoric disorder I love this birth control they tried to put me on something else and I said no I love this BC and I want to stay on it Regulated my periods took away migraines took away me throwing up whenever my period came and I never gained weight from it I recommend this BC to anyone
6389,Ocella,Birth Control,9,42383,4,Starting in elementary school my acne was horrible At age it morphed into a rare form of cystic acne Came back a couple years after the first bout was defeated Currently just and have been on Ocella since mid August Since being put on Ocella my acne has decreased immensely and stayed as regular types of breakouts rather than the cystic variety Havent experienced any major side effects although I am more prone to getting emotional over the sweet mushy gushy stuff At first my sex drive was higher even though Ive never actually acted on it but that has calmed down now My periods are a bit lighter and are slightly more predictable down to the start and end days I would definitely recommend this birth control
6393,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,9,42340,3,Overall no major issues with Ocella and Ive been on it for over two years I started taking it due to terrible heavy periods that caused nausea and migraines My periods are much lighter now and my face rarely breaks out I still get migraines and cramps but not as bad as before Ive also avoided pregnancy and I never had issues with mood swings
6394,Ocella,Birth Control,8,42314,1,Im writing this because as I do more research to try to find a new BC I realize most people leave bad reviews I had been on Ocella for almost years when my doc recently told me its known to cause blood clots Until then I had otherwise a good experience with it I think the most noticeable things I can remember or slight dryness and a decreased sex drive But no emotional turmoil or headaches which is what Im facing now I miss Ocella
6395,Ocella,Acne,9,42276,4,I started ocella my freshman year of college and had horrible under the skin acne all through high school Im now a junior in college and love it My skin cleared up except for a few during my period I also gained a couple pounds and my boobs grew a whole cup size Highly recommend
6396,Ocella,Birth Control,4,42270,4,Not a huge fan I started taking Ocella about months ago only as birth control It was my first experience being on the pillGood NEVER GOT PREGNANTMeh I went up a full cup size C to a D but I already have a small frame so I didnt celebrateBad It gave me terrible nausea headaches and migraines I started having awful mood swings and felt like I was always lashing out Period didnt change I still had an extremely heavy flow for at least a week with little to no spotting before or after and said goodbye to too many pairs of cute panties Worst of all it brought an a horrible bout of depression that Im still dealing withI recently switched to another birth control with lower estrogen so hopefully it goes better this time
6397,Ocella,Acne,10,42243,2,After only a month on Ocella I have noticed my skin clearer than ever I have a higher sex drive than ever and I have actually lost a couple pounds More than happy with this birth control
6398,Ocella,Birth Control,1,42227,5,Ive been taking this for the past six months and Im so ready to ditch it Yes it cleared up my acne but Ive gained almost lbs and cannot get rid of them Ive tried exercise and changed my eating habits but no success Its also made me really irritable and tired Thankfully Im meeting with my doctor next month
6399,Ocella,Birth Control,1,42219,4,If youre considering using this I wouldnt recommend it On the first week of using this I would find myself hysterically crying on the bathroom floor at night I got really depressed while on it on the first week On the second week literally on the th day of using this I got hives I didnt stop using it hoping it would just go away Wrong It got so bad I was hospitalized for it
6401,Ocella,Birth Control,7,42129,6,prosmuch lighter period shorter period daysalmost no crampsno pregnancy scares clearer skin CONSreally sore boobs all of the time high blood pressure lost a lot of hair and my hair about half as thick as it use to be
6402,Ocella,Birth Control,9,42129,3,No side effectsnausea headachesetc Regulated my period
6404,Ocella,Birth Control,7,41181,8,I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and I have tried A LOT of different birth control I used this particular formulation for about a year Unlike the others I did not bleed through this one I did however cry at everything I cried when I saw cute kids playing when Kelso did cute things for Jackie on That s Show and when I got good grades on tests Everything made me cry Also my breasts were tender all the time and I never wanted sex but that has been the case for all years of birth control I did not notice any substantial weight gain
6405,Ocella,Birth Control,3,41134,9,Pros Periods were lighter cramps hardly existed not pregnant I got on the pill for these reasons So yes it worked for that In addition I lost about pounds However CONS I was SUPER depressed and that depression hit hard Ive always been a happy outgoing person but Ocella made me upset at random times and now that Im off it my period is heavier than before and the cramps are worse Ive also gained weight since going off the pill Im lbs I would not recommend it Of course there was the noticeable decline in sex drive but that didnt bother me much
6407,Ocella,Acne,5,41107,7,I began using this birth control in January to treat cystic acne and to prep me for beginning Accutane My periods before this pill were bad I had heavy bleeding with painful cramps Once I began the birth control they got lighter and now I have absolutely no cramps My face looks fantastic now I only have the occasional zit I can handle that since I used to have at one time I would say I started to notice side effects around May of I began having pretty bad headaches usually everyday when I wake up I had a little bit of weight gain The worst was how moody I began to be I would really only like spending time alone I also lost my sex drive completely
6409,Ocella,Birth Control,7,41004,0,I have had the exact same reaction to Ocella as the poster named quotNo Babies but Im Crazyquot I switched to Ocella from Levora because Levora was giving me really bad mood swings When I was on it I would burst into tears all the time for no reason This side effect decreased dramatically when I switched to Ocella but I do still get mood swings quite often The biggest difference is that my moods on Ocella are more angryagitated than weepy which they were when I took Levora However I feel like the moods are more manageable which is why Im still on Ocella after months I stopped taking Levora after When it comes time to renew my prescription in months I may consider choosing a new pill
6412,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,9,40978,9,I am and I love Ocella I feel like its balanced me out I used to feel depressed moody and irritable for the two weeks before my period Almost suicidal in the couple of days before it Then my period would come full blast for the first two days and I would be in so much pain that all I could do was scream I couldnt work or go to school I took a lot of pain medicines so I was too high to function and also could still feel occasional plain Now on Ocella I felt the extreme pain for maybe an hour when my period starts and then Im able to take a normal amount of pain medicines and Im fine to go to school The mood swings before my period are very slight I also use it as birth control I do not feel a decrease in my sex drive
6414,Ocella,Birth Control,9,40941,0,Ocella has worked very well for me I have gained no weight have lighter periods light cramping and have only one issue I become emotional and insecure around day or and then it subsides Im usually stable However Ive decided to give another birthcontrol a try because my cost is so high But I will consider going back to Ocella if this new one doesnt work out
6415,Ocella,Birth Control,2,40935,1,This it the first birth control pill that Ive been on as I dont necessarily like the idea of hormonal contraceptives I just started Ocella this month and so far I have bled for days straight lightly but Ive been used to light periods that last four or five days and my emotions have been out of control I normally have light mood swings before my period but this has been ten times worse and nonstop for the week and a half that Ive been on Ocella I crave junk food hours a day and feel angry or upset about the littlest thingsMy skin is pretty clear naturally and I havent noticed a change in that My sex drive is about the same I cant say much else as this is my first month on it but I am not a fan of the super PMS so far
6416,Ocella,Birth Control,1,40927,1,I was on Yaz before and did just fine on it They switched me to Ocella four months ago and said that it was the same but I am having such a hard time on it I bleed heavy cramp and have migraines for at least days It knocks me off my feet to where all I can do is stay in bed all day I have to use double protection when on my period I bleed so much the first month that I almost had my husband take me to the ER I instead started taking iron pills to help me recover from my period With all the scare on blood clots in the news I just called and asked my doctor to switch me to something else The other thing was that I have zero sex drive and I cant lose weight
6418,Ocella,Birth Control,7,40914,1,yr old been on Ocella for over a year Just today switched to Apri Ocella made me gain weight and go up a bra size I went from a heavy long period with no pain to an extremely painful short period not worth it This pill also made me moody and depressed
6419,Ocella,Birth Control,9,40913,2,I am and started Ocella three months ago because I wanted to switch off the three month schedule which I hated I am only finishing up the third month this next week but I love it I would get the WORST mood swings when I PMSed that my friends would purposely avoid me Since switching to Ocella I have had a MAJOR decrease in mood swings My acne cleared up for the first two months but I broke out pretty bad during the third month And my period used to last days and now is about days And now my period comes at a regular time The only cons I could have about this product is around the time of my period I am extremely bloated and I get terrible cramps But since my mood swings are gone I a would completely recommend Ocella
6420,Ocella,Birth Control,1,40890,5,Ocella was the first contraceptive birth control I tried and I thought I was going crazy because of its side effects As a generally happy and healthy woman I was so confused and lost as to why Id suddenly turned into someone that couldnt stand to get out of bed I cried ALL THE TIME It could be the tiniest of things that would elicit tears but it was constant I shut almost everyone but my boyfriend at the time out and was so depressed I didnt even know what to do This lasted months before my mom forced me to stop it of which I am very thankful for Ocella made me a different person sure it did its job in keeping me from getting pregnant but the girl it made me into is not worth that protection
6422,Ocella,Birth Control,2,40838,3,My doctor prescribed me Ocella last year and I remembered it made me feel horrible but not the exact reason why My vagina is always dry no matter how excited I am and sex is horrible I noticed that when I wasnt having sex Now that Im having sex regularly my libido is really low I think its too much estrogen for me Overall most days I just feel sick and my period was just light spotting so I guess that was the only benefit coming from week long periods
6423,Ocella,Acne,6,40837,10,I got Ocella solely for the reason that I dont want to get pregnant and I got it for free with my insurance With starting my first pack I was nauseous the first three days or so but not so bad I guess Now Im on my last week of my second pack about to be on my third pack and my acne has gotten a lot worse unfortunately Im going to wait a couple of months to see if that changes though because other than that I love it
6425,Ocella,Birth Control,9,40696,1,I have been on Ocella now for over years Like many of you I was taking Yasmin and it was switched and I wasnt told but noticed it before I took it I called my pharmacy just to make sure this was the right medicine and it was I havent had any problems except for one I have a low sex drive Im years old and I honestly thought my body changed after having children I did not know this was a possible side effect Other than that I love it My periods are regular lighter and come on time I have no cramps and my skin cleared up I was also not aware of Ocella switching to a name brand drug
6426,Ocella,Birth Control,4,40687,6,Have been taking Ocella for months and at first the only things I noticed were positive it cleared up the mild adult acne that I had developed around my jawline and my breasts seemed to get bigger Then I began to notice more negative than positive First Ive gained pounds in months with little change to my diet Second I experience spotting between periods Third I am ten times more moody than I was before which is strange for me because I am always pretty stable and happy Last Ive been feeling very bloated and maybe a little constipated So overall the pill is doing the job and Im afraid to get off of it because I dont want to start breaking out but I also dont want to stay on it and continue to gain weight
6427,Ocella,Birth Control,5,40653,2,I have been taking Ocella now for about months and in those months I have experienced some weight loss as well as clearer skin However I also have found that I have ABSOLUTELY NO sex drive I am only and before taking Ocella I had enough sex drive for me and other people but now nothing
6428,Ocella,Birth Control,3,40589,4,Had severe mood swings dry eyes to the point of not being able to wear contacts weight gain breast tenderness
6429,Ocella,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,40508,11,I have tried practically every treatment there is for PCOS and unfortunately Yasmin is the only thing that has helped me But it puts about pounds on me
6431,Ocella,Birth Control,6,40472,4,Ive been on Ocella for two days but those two days my doctor advised me to take a double dose two pills a night for these first nights So far Ive had bad nausea dizziness headaches and been extremely tired I hope that when I start a regular dose these side effects will go away
6433,Ocella,Birth Control,8,40470,37,yrs old healthy On Ocella months Take it same time each day Periods lightershorter with less cramping Cleared up moderate acne Great birth control still kid free Complaint is emotional side effects which I noticed months after starting Ocella Super emotional for weeks before my period never had PMS symptoms before Tiniest thing bothers me very irrational and impatient Feel like Ive gone insane weeks each month Worst part is I know Im being ridiculous but cant pull myself out of it Was on antidepressants for yrs and this makes me feel like Im getting depressed again each month Only time I feel normal is when Im on my period I want to switch to a pill that has a gradual hormone transition throughout the month
6434,Ocella,Birth Control,9,40462,7,Im years old and started birth control on Ortho Tri Cyclen I stopped for about a year or so then when I went back to the GYN she put me on Ocella I havent ever had problems with my period but it did lighten it up for me quite a bit Ive been on it for about years and it has just recently brought me from a day period to a day period I was a bit surprised but I dont mind at all I have never detected any differences on and off birth control except its easier to pin point when things will happen throughout the month I usually get a very mild acne break out right before as well as some cramps which dont last very long I have occasional emotional breakdowns but they are so rare that I dont really contribute it to Ocella
6435,Ocella,Acne,8,40426,7,I started taking this for acne which Ocella cleared up REALLY well except for the period week during which Ill get minor acne breakouts but I must add that now Ive been experiencing a huge decrease in my sex drive Im starting to wonder if I should get off of it just to feel like a normal sexual adult This is just getting weird
6436,Ocella,Birth Control,9,40378,7,Ive been using this birth control pill for about months now and its great I do get the occasional discharge and sometimes moody It made my breasts bigger but kind of sensitive My acne has really cleared up after using so many different things out there to treat it I recommend Ocella it really gets the job done
6437,Ocella,Birth Control,6,40370,6,I switched to Ocella after taking Yaz for months I have PCOS as well Ocella worked wonderfully in clearing my skin and it gave me a day period instead of the constant flow That was a relief But I had bad side effects that caused me to ask for a change in medication after or months using it I didnt realize they were connected to birth control at first but now its obvious with timing I get debilitating migraine headaches during the first few days of the placebo week from hormone drop and the week before my period I have severe constipation which affects my body image I feel unattractive It also has me very depressed a week before too And this last month I started spotting weeks in
6438,Ocella,Birth Control,4,40353,2,I was on Ocella for about months I never experienced any headaches or spotting or anything like that and Im not pregnant so in those aspect Ocella was great But I had horrible MOOD SWINGS
6439,Ocella,Birth Control,3,40350,2,I just switched from YAZ to Ocella and since then I have been so emotional Crying almost very day and mood swings are crazy I was not like this at all when I was on YAZ
6440,Ocella,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,7,40320,11,I started taking Yasmin when I had a continuous period of bleeding for months I took it for years until Ocella came out as the generic form of Yasmin I had no complaints and it helped regulate all my symptoms and made that time of the month more bearable for me I could get out of bed and actually function the way I normally do The only downside I had to taking this is I did develop Gallbladder disease and ended up having an emergency gallbladder removal I would recommend that anyone who takes this watch what they are eating too and limit lots of fatty foods
6443,Ocella,Birth Control,7,40251,6,Ive been on Ocella for over a year and I dont mind it It does its jobNegatives It kills your sex drive horrible cramps acne around your period time but thats with anyonePositives Emotions have been under control and periods only last about daysOverall I would recommend this birth control I dont have spotting or emotional breakdowns or any of that
6444,Ocella,Birth Control,6,40216,3,I would say this is an okay medicine It works wonderfully at preventing pregnancy Ive been on it for a year and the only problem Ive run into is horrible mood swings and depression the entire sugar pill week Otherwise Ive had shorter periods lighter periods but pretty bad cramps
6445,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,2,40205,14,I took this medicine for a year and just switched I had many negative symptoms that started with severe nausea every night about an hour after taking it For the first three months my periods got lighter for a few months and then went back to heavy I did always get my period on the exact day I was supposed to but throughout the whole year was VERY emotional and at time felt as though I had no control over myself this was my main pushing factor to switching I WANT ME BACK I just want to say that I understand and hope others do too that my body acts differently to birth control than others and just want to let everyone know that not all medicines work for everyone if this does not work the way you want try something new BE HAPPY
6448,Ocella,Birth Control,8,40184,2,I use Ocella and my only complaints are that I am moody occasionally and my periods are heavier and I get very bad cramps which I never used to get I actually lost six pounds in the first month I took it but it didnt really clear up my face completely just a little I would recommend this birth control
6450,Ocella,Birth Control,10,40158,6,I LOVE OCELLA I was on a generic form of Seasonale and it was HORRIBLE had the worst depressionmood swings ever and breakthrough bleeding EVERYDAY So I switched to Ocella and love it Acne hasnt really cleared up and do have some weight gain but my eating habits arent the best either so I wont blame it on that I dont like that the price went up but Im not going to switch because I feel so normal now and never want to experience anything like my first birth control I definitely recommend Ocella
6451,Ocella,Birth Control,4,40128,13,I started out on Yasmin but had to switch to Ocella since I have no prescription coverage Between the two I was on them for over years In that time I gained pounds After I switched to Ocella While I was taking it my moods were level but the first day without the pill I felt completely out of control of my emotions and on an emotional rollercoaster to the point of having to leave work a few times which is not me at all Once I got my period it was better but I didnt look forward to the next month After a crazy month of breakthrough bleeding emotional ups and downs and feeling like I was going crazy I asked my doctor to switch me to something else My sister had the same symptoms within a month or two and so did friends
6452,Ocella,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,40123,19,Count me as another woman upset that Ocella is no longer a generic According to BlueCross who has received tons of calls on this change Ocella is now a brand name drug and is also nonformulary Even though the drug worked great for me and was helpful in my treatment of PCOS theres no way I can spend for a three month supply especially for something that used to be completely covered by insurance
6453,Ocella,Birth Control,10,40115,5,Im going through the same thing right now I used to pay and now they want for Ocella Im a college student I cant afford that every month So Im looking into Apri now as my doctor recommended Overall I was fine with Ocella and Yasmin It made my boobs bigger clears my face and I always know when Ill get my period
6459,Ocella,Birth Control,5,41890,7,This may be premature Ive only been on it for a week but I have been super moody Irritable cried x in past week and have developed a lot of pimples on my forehead and nose I usually never break out only when on my period and not as much as this I also am highly anxiousIm an anxious person to begin with but with the pill for this week Ive been near panic attack a lot and that hasnt happened in a decade ImHoping my body gets used to the pill and these awful side effects will go away Will update after the month
6460,Ocella,Birth Control,9,41864,11,Ive been taking Ocella for months First birth control Ive ever been on and I havent had any major problems I used to have terrible cramps during my period with a very heavy flow and now its wicked light and virtually no cramps Didnt have any moody side effects and no weight gain
6461,Ocella,Birth Control,6,41848,8,Im years old This is the end of my first month taking Ocella to regulate my periods Ive been having occasional random cramps throughout this month which was manageable but now that Im in the middle of the sugar pill week my pain is terrible These are the worst cramps of my life But the positive is my breasts got a little bigger I lost a little weight and less acne I also have less cravingsBut the pain is more than I can stand Im considering going to the hospital I cant stand without getting pale and lightheaded and Ive already vomited twice This is day of my period
6463,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,7,41788,0,I have been on this for over a year I was on Sydea previously for a year This birth control works great There are no cramps its a lighter flow Im more emotionally stable its shorter and I only had one scare because I forgot to take it for two days in a row and my period came late The only downside Ive noticed is that I have almost NO sex drive now But my insurance covers it all until Im no longer considered a dependentfull time student
6464,Ocella,Birth Control,8,41760,6,Ive been using Ocella for a few months I dont use condoms and Ive had zero scares so far I have hormonal acne and its getting better slowly My periods are amazing now I have no cramps whatsoever My moods are great Not on birth control I am a crazy monster My cramps are unbearable for days I have not had much weight gain and my cravings are less than normal So far I like this
6465,Ocella,Birth Control,8,41695,8,I have been on Ocella for a year now I used to take Yaz which is in the family and loved it I have definitely gained weight and having a hard time losing it My moods are fine I dont feel sick at all I actually feel very normal The downs I found beside the weight is I have zero sex drive And I do get chest pains
6466,Ocella,Birth Control,3,41580,6,Originally on Syeda was switched to Ocella last month and this month and have had a continuous yeast infection
6467,Ocella,Birth Control,9,41530,11,No significant weight gain No cramping during period Period lasts for a shorter amount of time No heavy bleeding no spotting eitherOverall Im very happy with Ocella Im and have been taking it for years At this point Im not even sure how my body would react to not being on birth control since it has been so long
6468,Ocella,Birth Control,9,41511,6,I tried Ortho TriCyclen years ago I switched to Ocella weeks later because Ortho TriCyclen made me nauseous and made my gums itchy I have experienced weight gain lbs caused by eating all my cravings Ive taken it from to now and havent had any bad experiences
6469,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,7,41500,3,I used to take Sprintec to regulate my period and help with cramps which worked for a while but after years my periods were back to being miserable The first week or two on Ocella were tough I was very nauseous had stomach cramps and headaches but it all went away after the second week The first day of my period the first months was incredible I didnt even feel like I had a period but by day my awful cramps were back I spoke to my Gyno and weve decided I can take Ocella continuously Next week is the first placebo week that Im skipping and I will only have periods a year Besides the first couple of weeks I havent had any other side effects
6471,Ocella,Birth Control,8,41307,22,Im ft and lbs Ive been on Ocella for ish years now I originally was on Yaz then Yasmin the When Ocella came out I switched For me the experience was normal I was moody on my periods nothing new and a big decrease in acne But now I am thinking of switching to a stronger birth control even though Ive been on Ocella for so long and love the product I think my body needs a change in medication Im becoming a little more irritated then the first years my nipples are especially tender after my period which never happened before Its time for a change Overall a great product if you would like to see a decrease in acne no weight gain no pregnancy scares no depression or moodiness for the most part Good for older teens
6472,Ocella,Birth Control,10,41304,13,years No health issues or pregnancy scares
6473,Ocella,Birth Control,9,41278,9,yrs no issues
6474,Ocella,Birth Control,5,41261,11,Have been taking Ocella for four months now due to polycystic ovarian syndrome Ive been experiencing elevated blood pressure and this is causing some other ill feelings such as nausea and shortness of breath which immediately triggers anxiety attacks Surprisingly I feel fine emotionally for the majority of the timeMy breast size has increased my sex drive is up my periods are lighter and my skin is clearer The negative symptoms I have been experiencing have not been frequent they have only occurred recently However the severe elevation in my blood pressure is cause for concern and I may switch next month to a new pill
6476,Ocella,Birth Control,9,41225,17,Ive been on Ocella for about months now after being on Microgestin for years I dont have too many complaints with either although I will say that my skin is far clearer on Ocella than it ever was on Microgestin My periods on Ocella are quite light and last only days cramps are usually mild No headaches nausea mood swings or noticeable change in sex drive which seem to be a problem for a lot of other women Also I actually dropped a couple of pounds after starting Ocella with no lifestyle or diet change My only concern is that I do have a history of ovarian cysts which Microgestin effectively quashed only time will tell whether or not Ocella causes any change years old otherwise healthy
6478,Ocella,Acne,8,41184,10,All have been changed since a month after starting Ocella Soft clear skin and brighter complexion No more yellow and dull face Waking up with fresh skin as if I just washed my face More incline to wear sun block and makeup My hair no longer oily and stop falling out I did stop for months due to dryness and no sex drive A BIG MISTAKE Ask your doctor the correct way to phase it out I am retaking it again
6480,Ocella,Acne,9,40113,5,I have been on Ocella for cycles and have experienced lighter periods and no side effects except a slight headache during menstruation My skin is slowly clearing I had small bumps from hormones around my jawline I am concerned it has been changed from a generic per posts I just picked up at Walmart yesterday and paid so I am confused
6481,Ocella,Birth Control,1,40105,2,Ocella was considered generic but recently within the last weeks was changed to be a brand name for no reason what so ever by Medispan
6482,Ocella,Birth Control,9,40105,3,Ive been taking Ocella for months and so far everything is going great I feel normal my period comes on time every month and my period is not as heavy Occasionally I feel nauseous around my period but that sideeffect occurs with or without birth control I would recommend this oral contraceptive to anyone who is between late teens and early twenties
6483,Ocella,Birth Control,9,40102,6,Ive been on Ocella going on almost a year then boom its no longer generic bucks a month Or if you buy months and thats with insurance all in a matter of three months from when I last refilled my prescription very upsetting Only one manufacturer for it so it is now a brand Im not sure if this all works under your insurance and what they cover but that was the reason I was given for the increase Now Im nervous about switching to something else because thats just outrageous to pay especially in this economy bucks for months worth was nice hopefully having to switch doesnt cost me elsewhere Other than that I think this is a great birth control and would continue to use it if I could afford it
6485,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,9,40024,6,I had so many bizarre symptoms I had hot and cold flashes night sweats numbness and tingling in fingers and feetcalf that lasted weeks difficulty concentrating and I had mild depression symptoms easy to cry very emotional irritable etc Many premenopausal symptoms that were getting harder to live with I was also diagnosed with an underactive thyroid that was adding to my symptoms The first HRT hormone replacement therapy pill I was put on I was allergic to one of the dyes in the third week of pills This pill has improved my symptoms greatly and I am interested in my husband once again THANK YOU Ocella for making me feel better
6486,Ocella,Acne,9,40009,56,First of let me say I am a Pharmacy Technician I was on Yaz for about months It was okay It wasnt strong enough to stop my periods until about days into a new pack it didnt do much for my skin and it was month because there is no generic I only kept taking it because it didnt make me nauseous I am very sensitive to nauseaAfter month was a little too much I went to my doctor and wanted to be put on Ocella because it would only be month and it has the same hormones as Yaz which didnt make me sick but it was mg stronger which made me a little nervous But I tried it didnt make me sick AT ALL cleared my skin up periods start and stop on time no cramps cheaper generic and I lost lbs LOVE IT
6487,Ocella,Menstrual Disorders,8,40007,2,Ocella has worked so far for me I have been on a couple before Ocella and this has worked the best I hope it keeps working for me knock on wood
6488,Ocella,Birth Control,8,39964,5,Ocella is a good birth control medication For the four months Ive been taking it my only complaint is the multiple periods of breakthrough bleeding bloating and nausea Im sure weight gain would be on my complaint list but you just have to maintain a really good diet and exercise whenever you can But its great
6493,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,3,43061,1,I was on Cipralex for years and I got fed up with the reduced erections and orgasms My endocrinologist recommended trying an SNRI Wellbutrin mg and it helped a bit with the bad side effects of cipralex but I found that I was sad often and Irsquod cry easily I increased the dosage to mg and the sadness went away almost instantly After a few weeks at mg I started to feel more and more anxious I had read that the dosage shouldnrsquot go beyond so I didnrsquot want to risk an increase so I stopped taking them completely and the anxiety has almost disappeared Almost means that its betterIrsquove been off of Wellbutrin for almost a week and I havenrsquot had any side effects yet
6495,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,2,43025,9,Took mg for days and suddenly stating feeling weakness aches pains then sore throat accompanied by fever called my Dr she made me stop taking it and was given toradol to break fever of and steroids and fluids went from to pounds in days Had my heart rate and blood pressure up also This drug may be for others but definitely not me too many adverse effects Ive tried zoloft Prozac and lexapro anti depressents are not for me
6496,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,7,42999,10,I took wellbutrin to help with motivation and energy which were major sources of my depression The first two weeks were absolutely terrible The only side effect I had was night sweating and it was so bad that I got no sleep every night I would fall asleep and wake up covered in so much sweat there would be pools of water on my chest Had to wear clothes from head to toe and sleep on a towel After that it worked fine However it didnt really help with the motivation It gave me more energy but didnt allow me to use it for anything That ended up increasing my anxiety However during this period I did not experience a single side effect other than occasional chest pain which was probably from the anxietystress anyways
6497,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorde,5,42996,3,Im on mg Wellbutrin XLs and since Ive started taking them Ive noticed my dreams are extremely vivid and disturbing Im getting confused easily major insomnia which isnt normal for me by any means Was on Prozac then Lexapro switched to celexa after doses and now Im stuck with Wellbutrin I was told to push through and keep taking it but all of my experiences with stimulants with an amphetemine base have been unpleasant Im probably going to discontinue it Id rather be unmedicated than lose days of sleep and have horrible dreams whenever I can sleep Not a great experience imo
6498,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,9,42996,22,I was started on mg at first and for weeks I had the worst side effects I literally thought I was going insane The doctor told me it was normal and ride it out another week So I did and it passed They moved me to mg XL and it worked wonderful for years A few years in I had to go up to XL but I was still panic free and depression free Until recently when it stopped working and I had Prozac added to the mix I would recommend welbutrin XL to people Just know you can push through those awful side effects for a few weeks to feel better
6499,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,10,42993,16,I started taking Wellbutrin XL August of After starting this drug I had the motivation and desire to go out and change my life As a man this drug drastically increased my sex drive Which was a huge relief That first day and all that night all I could dream about was sex Everything was much quotbiggerquot too I think because Wellbutrin increased my blood flow and heart rate This went on for about two weeks until everything levelled out However my sex drive still remained more elevated The only negative side effects I had were extreme migraines those same two weeks I think I also lost a lot of weight but Im not sure how much I was the skinniest I had ever been at that time
6500,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorde,10,42991,23,In the last years I have taken a few meds for my depression Started with Lexapro which helped but caused very quick weight gain Switched to Cymbalta which caused rash Switched quickly to Prozac which caused horrible dreams and sexual issues Was then put on Wellbutrin by a psych NPR because of my issues with weight gain and sexual side effects Drug was a miracle for me Lost lbs in years after starting it and sexual side effects disappeared Started out on mg a day but upped to mg a day when I had a depressive episode Since upping dose have had no issues other than unusual dreams but can live with that Nothings perfect
6502,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorde,10,42970,24,So I was on Lexapro mg for months and it helped somewhat with my very SEVERE depression that I was suffering from with severe anxiety It was HELL So my next appointment with the nurse practitioner I was prescribed bupropionXL and she told me to add it to my lexapro and too take both together but as soon as I started too take them both I got very emotionally sad and numb so my sister told me to stop taking the lexapro to give the bupropion a chance to work on its own and that has helped so much because now I feel a lot better then before and Im only taking mg XL Just wanted to share my experience with anyone
6503,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorde,4,42969,6,Ive been taking this medication for under months now and I have gained lbs while taking this drug I dont feel like I have increased energy than before like some other people described I feel more irritable amp anxious at times still cant sleep at night I get the dry mouth side effects and occasional constipation Im taking mg XL once a day I am getting more depressed with gaining weight on this drug I was taking Lexapro before amp didnt find it help me feeling less depressed amp experience alot of nightmare or weird dreams while taking Lexapro
6504,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,7,42953,16,I have been taking Wellbutrin XL for over years The reason for my review is recently Ive been feeling more quotdownquot lately and wondering whether this drug has run its course with me Before Wellbutrin I was taking Effexor and it made me feel fantastic I stopped Effexor because the longer I took it the more side effects it had If I didnt take Effexor at the same time each day or god forbid forget it I would be dizzy and sweating I like Wellbutrin because I dont feel any side effects No weight gain no sexual disfunction I would like to find another drug for depression that works well and has little side effects Any suggestions
6506,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,9,42922,63,Was taking Wellbutrin XL bupropion mg in AM amp Zoloft sertraline mg at night There was a miscommunication at my pharmacy so was out of Zoloft over a holiday weekend days It was the best miscommunication ever With solely the Wellbutrin XL I have my old self back minus the anxiety amp depression I wakeup refreshed I have more energy Im not napping every day or extremely lethargic Im excited to exercise my libido is back amp Im calm and happy It also has seemed to help with my food cravings extra bonus
6508,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,4,42918,12,Been on it for one week XL dry mouth Lost voice Insomnia But I was up and Adam chipper and slaying at work Like being on speed Went down to mg to try and see if helped Constant muscle spasms and a feeling of hypertension in my arms Heart rate seems higher Just feel not worth it Plus did u see the withdraw experiences Atrocious Getting off before its too late Dont need high blood pressure this young
6509,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,4,42900,11,Was on mg for three weeks then went up to mg for a week Had to stop taking it Had a weird experience where I was standing beside a running shower just standing there in a daze Not for like seconds but standing there standing there That was the last time I took them now on Lexapro
6510,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorde,5,42898,22,I am currently using wellbutrin xl mg a day as an add on to trintellix I have been on every medication under the sun amp always seem to have negative side effects My biggest struggle with my depression is fatigue amp no energy Ive only been on wellbutrin days amp I feel a tremendous difference I am awake in the morning amp dont feel like I am going to fall asleep at random times during the day I also havent taken a nap in days either which is huge considering I always nap I am a little anxious sometimes amp am also dealing with sleeping issues so I may talk to my Dr about switching to the SR I am also dealing with a lot of muscle spams but this always happens when I adjust a dose or try a new medication Wish I tried this sooner

6529,Sodium biphosphate / sodium phosphate,Bowel Preparation,1,42403,0,Terrible product Not the first time I have used for bowel prep for sigmoidoscopy and both times it has caused severe cramps chills headache and rectal bleeding I am guessing if used for constipation perhaps not absorbing as much of the medication to get the severe cramps

6538,Sodium biphosphate / sodium phosphate,Bowel Preparation,1,41119,10,After about the third set of pills each followed by oz of water I had projectile vomiting I was so sick and in so much pain I thought it was going to be a great alternative to the liquid prep which I can not tolerate at all Now a week later and I am still having bloating stomach cramps black bowel movements weight gain and very swollen ankles which is something I have never suffered from I also did not take the last set of pills and had to give myself a fleets enema to complete the prep I noticed afterward however that it says to use caution if taking lisinopril and oxycodone so perhaps that is why I had such a difficult time

6551,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,9,42787,81,I have been on MG XL for months now I was prescribed it because of the death of my teenage son and also the end of a relationship I was diagnosed with moderate depression I felt like a zombie with very little motivation I always work out and have managed to stay active but still things were not right I went on this and it has made all the difference I will agree there is apathy while on it The highs are not as high but the lows are not as low You just have a quiet balance in your life and it does not feel like you are on any sort of medication I attempted to go off of it and could already tell I felt sad so trying another months I did not lose any weight but I am pretty thin already Wonderful medicine for me

6553,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorde,1,42760,31,This did nothing for me as far as Im concerned I think its a placebo I was very depressed because I felt awful everyday I could barely get out of bed I felt exhausted foggy mind body ached and long list of other debilitating symptoms I knew I wasnt just feeling these things physically for no reason Im only yrs old and when I started having memory problems I knew that it wasnt just Depression My primary doc did blood work and found I had some severe vitamin deficiencies I got some prescription vitamins and changed my diet I feel better physically and mentally This may not help everyone but I encourage you to make sure your doc does a lot of tests tests to rule out others health issues before before blaming depression
6555,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,9,42747,113,Day of taking Wellbutrin XL I was the most positive Ive been in a long time I had a very vivid colorful dream that first night the first time Ive ever dreamt in color that I can remember The dreams subsided after day one but the medication continued to make me feel better Im about months in and its been absolutely amazing in treating my depression My motivation has drastically skyrocketed and I feel more positive and optimistic about life

6590,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,4,42482,31,Beta blockers dont work tried primidone recently Started at mg now up to mg improvement Im not sure if I want to take this long term for improvement I have gotten by most of the time just dealing with my tremors But Im so tired of having them
6593,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,10,42348,50,I have been taking mgs of Primidone for the last years for Benign Essential Whats so essential about it Tremor As far as I know I have no side effects When I first began the medication I started out with a smaller dose and worked up to mgs I found that I could not take the meds during the day because of sleepiness dizziness etc so my doc suggested that I take it at night I have been taking it at bedtime since and it helps to put me to sleep
6594,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,4,42189,30,It seems to have a marginal effect
6595,Primidone,Seizures,10,42153,0,No seizures no side effects
6596,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,1,41934,65,Started out days ago mg tab at night and morning I am up to morning and night Doc says stay on them until we meet in days This is not working Tremors are continuing some times to an extreme We need to revisit this prescription Try something else
6597,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,7,41915,91,For Essential Tremor Took me a long time to get used to side effects Felt scared Dizzy Headache Nausea Increased heart rate Anxious Barely standing because I started too high at mg Need to start very low for me I finally got better No shakes Very pleased The Neurologist Office kept rescheduling me and I ran out This second time starting was even more AWFUL Flu like plus feeling kind of like I was in a total mental fog Odd Be cautious is my opinion I was in misery for days Unable to function Finally getting better Day Should have taken at bed time Never knew
6598,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,4,41769,71,I have had Essential Tremor for several years I have been taking propranolol and clonazepam for last several years but have seen a return of tremor lately My doctor added primidone in last month I have been having great difficulty adjusting to medicines though I feel like Im spinning most of time seems to cause increase in shakiness as medicine begins to wear off at least thats my opinion and has caused an inability to ejaculate I am currently working on increasing my dosage amounts I started at mg with intended dose of mg nightly as goal
6599,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,8,41608,99,I have been working up from a starter dose mg of Primidone to mg over the last six months Also take a beta blocker for my heart My essential tremor Has reduced by Very manageable now

6601,Primidone,Seizures,10,41458,35,I became ill in at age with encephalitis brain damage on temporal lobe and grand mal seizures The next year I was also diagnosed with Lupus in addition to epilepsy It took years and NIH treatment of mg of Mysoline times a day to control my seizuresIt has been controlling my seizures and I am now AARP denied my brand name Mysoline for seizures even though I was going to pay high copays We pay our own insurance so this is a real problem The worst is fighting AARP to pay their part when I know Mysoline works for years How can a person at a desk just suggest other medicines to take when your doctor and you state that this is the best one for you
6603,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,9,40990,90,Primidone is very effective I was on Inderal LA mg take once a day Then it stopped working They added Primidone mg take three times daily The combination works best My tremors are very difficult to deal with They got so bad as to interfere with normal everyday things
6605,Primidone,Seizures,7,40535,30,I was prescribed this medicine back in the late s for seizure control I recently stopped using this in It controlled my seizures well but I did not realize the side effects of it Side effects were irritability anger increased depression and behaviorBecause I literally grew UP with this medicine I can now see these issues after changing the medicine My brain was built to use it during pubertyyoung adultThis does control seizures and actually suppressed anxiety by slowing down all brain functions Be aware that epilepsy is cormorbid with depression quite often and this medicine may enhanceincrease depression symptoms
6606,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,1,40161,65,I have epilepsy and had it controlled for several years with other medications Recently I was diagnosed with Essential Tremor and the doctor prescribed Primidone On the second day of use I had a seizure as I continued usage and increased dosage as directed I started losing muscle control in my legs I had periods where I thought I was losing my mind I was unable to speak clearly as it felt like my tongue was swollen but it was not It got to the point where I could not stand up in the shower without leaning against the walls My wife said get off that medicine Could not reach my doctor so I decreased dosage to zero I take a lot of different medications for number of different medical problems I think my brain had had it
6608,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,6,40125,132,Ive had essential tremor for most of my life It has got worse in the last years so Ive taken to different drugs at different times to see how well they worked Propanolol worked best but unfortunately brought out my old asthma that I hadnt had since childhood Primidone was the only other that seemed to work for me but was not a cure all The problem I had with Primidone was the bad effects it gave you but I persevered and it went away in to days and has not come back again The bottle says to take three mg pills a day This is a lower dosage But I just take one mg pill once a day and have on occasion upped it to two when I want to feel more confident in public without embarrassing myself with hand tremors
6609,Primidone,Seizures,9,40110,18,I have been using this medication for approximately years I have had two healthy children during this time I am now in my s and find that I am experiencing tiredness fatigue and incoordination to the extent that I stumble or run into people or things easier than before Whether this medication is a cause to my clumsiness or not I am not sure It has helped to control my seizures since my last one in
6610,Primidone,Seizures,10,40051,21,Great

6616,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,8,42979,1,I have sores in my mouth and Im frequently hoarse but it does help control the tremors

6621,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,6,42867,17,I have had a mild case of benign essential tremor for almost years My primary care doctor has always associated my shaking with anxiety or hormones however my neurologist diagnosed it as benign essential tremor I have been taking Primidone only mg twice a day for a month now and it seems to have decreased the shaking a bit However it makes me extremely tired and I sometimes have an odd dizzy feeling the first hour or so after taking it I am unsure if it will go away completely but it definitely has helped so I will continue to take this medication to see if the side effects eventually go away
6622,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,10,42840,11,Im a year old female and my tremor started when I was Back and forth to the doctors for years and told it was due to anxiety years ago they sent me to a neurologist who diagnosed me with a benign essential tremor which worsens when physical Ive been on Primidone for approximately months now and have increased the dosage from mg now a month later mg Tremor comes and goes still but not as badMy next problem now is a rare side effect of Primidone is a skin rash my doctors are unable to confirm whether this is due to the medication or whether it is Rosacea does anyone else have this problem I have now been advised to decrease my dosage I cannot win

6630,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,8,42741,28,After taking mgday for about months it felt great not to have my tremor as much But in the last months I have been getting stiffer and stiffer as the days went on I have one frozen shoulder confirmed but my back neck and other joints were aching too My GP looked up primidone in his book and said joint stiffness is a side effect So I have no choice but to reduce my dosage A week after reducing my tremor is much worse so I dont know what to do now as I have exhausted all other medication
6631,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,3,42712,10,Tremors seem to be getting worse I take a day Just turned Have had tremors for many yearsMaybe I should ask my doctor is there is something else for me to try

6633,Primidone,Seizures,1,42602,5,Im a yr old male I have essential tremor of the hands and neckhead Until yrs ago it had gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years Ive been taking Primidone for months now Ive recently increased the dosage to mg times a day This is the only Essential Tremor drug Im taking at this time Ive been on Inderal Topiramate Gabipentin CarbodopaLevadopa and combinations Recently Phenol injections into my neck muscles did more harm then good Now I cant even lift my arms above my shoulders Heres hoping the primidone increase has some effect on my hands and head shakes No side effects so far I have not figured out why some days I have almost no tremor Have tracked my diet doesnt seem to be connected
6635,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,8,42576,43,It took me months to adjust to primadone I was in a cloud not able to do my bookkeeping job not much of a short term memory but now after months I feel like my old self just in need of an hour napdayMy problem is I can only take half of a mg which is mg However these pills do not come in a mg Smallest mg is So I have to cut the pills in half In doing so the pill crumbles so I always lose half of it anyway I asked the pharmacist if they could cut the pill in half but they said that is illegal for a pharmacy to do soI wish it came in mg and I wish I could find out if it will in the futureAfter investing all this time in adjusting to the mg I would hate to start over with another drug

6638,Epoetin alfa,Anemia,9,42406,1,Works well but very costly
6640,Epoetin alfa,Anemia Chemotherapy Induced,9,41111,31,I found this medicine to be a life saver After my first month of treatment for CLLSLL I was thrown into chemoinduced anemia extremely quickly After having a rough week with a small fever my hemooncologist gave me a shot of this and one week later I thought I had been reborn Terrific stuff and will help platelets out magnificently Give it a shot no pun intended Feel Better amp Take Care

6644,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,7,40007,82,I found Mysoline effective for my essential tremor but the side effects of tiredness lack of energy plus reduced sexual function difficulty in ejaculating is quite frustrating
6645,Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,10,39847,130,I started using this in combination with propranolol for my tremor I take mg of the propranolol in the morning and mg of Primidone before bed I had been taking the propranolol for years already and it cuts the intensity of my tremors by By adding Primidone as a combination therapy I would say that its reduced If you have a hereditary tremor like this you should ask your doctor about these medicinesGood Luck
6646,Primidone,Seizures,9,39821,22,Great Seizure control Low side effects after first weeks
6651,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,9,42985,8,I have used for years and I have a little bit less sexual activity but it helps me to be more active in my work My hair is very much better and I have a little dizziness when getting up fast Totally I am totally satisfied
6652,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,2,42938,8,Have been taking this drug for almost a year now My hair was starting to thin a few years back and I just decided to give this a try as we all know nothing else works Since Ive been taking it I havent noticed any real side effects so I guess Ive been lucky in that sense but to be honest neither have I experienced any change in hair loss either My hair is still thinning probably even more so now than it used to This drug has been an absolute waste of time and money It does not work Scientists can transplant organs from one body to another they can clone sheep they can grow an ear on a mouses back but for some reason they cant figure out how to grow hair where hair used to grow anyway Dont waste your money
6653,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,1,42804,13,After days on Propecia I start to feel heavy brain fog I didnt now about this side effect but I found out on the internet that it is a common side I can tell you that feeling is worse than the sexual sides effects I wish no one to feel that horrible feeling
6654,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,9,42783,18,When I turned I went in for a physical The doctor noticed my hair was thinning and recommended Propecia That was years ago and today I have a very full head of hair especially for a yo Two issues one it must be taken religiously I take it at least times a year Two its not cheap Generics are available on the internet My brother was born months before me Physically we are very similar During our youth our hair was almost identical Today he is balding badly Side affects Shortly after I starting taking it I DID have trouble getting an erection but the problem went away after a number of weeks I was thinking of quitting but just wanted to give my body a little more time to adjust And it did No regrets
6655,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,1,42732,13,Im with mild receding hair still have a full head of hair but beginning to recede on the crown and round templesStarted Propecia on the had no side affects up until last night at no point did I look up reviews of side effects of the drug as I did not want other peoples experiences to play on my mind Last night noticed a tender pain in my testicules and its continued throughout the whole of today I am now stopping this drug immediately Ive spent the whole of day with aggressive pain the mentioned above area been projectile vomiting and had diarrhoea This drug has not worked for me and by reading others comments I will certainly review peoples opinions rather than trusting there findings
6656,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,1,42613,31,Dont take this drug I used it for a few months and it killed my libido I did get some noticeable hair regrowth during that time so at least that worked It became very hard to get an erection and I became completely disinterested in sexIve read accounts that some people never regained their libido and suffered lasting erectile dysfunctionThis is not natural Your libido is part of who you are and so is hair loss Be a man and accept the loss of your hair as part of who you were meant to be
6657,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,1,42502,41,Complete Brain Fog worse than anything you can imagine literally cant get out of bed because of the brain damage that this drug induced on me I feel completely literally detached from the world now not to mention even the less serious it caused ED no Libido Head Pressure complete cognitive shift feel like Im in a whole different world NEVER TOUCH this drug EVER EVER EVER unless your old and have nothing else to lose and dont care about life any more I would trade this with ANY other disease just for my brain function to come back again I feel like Im in a coma its absolutley frightful everyday it never leaves sexual sides are a joke compared to this
6658,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,7,41037,74,I have been using this medication for just over a year now Hair has regrown over my crown but the top and temple areas are still quite thin have not regrown and not responded in the same way I guess these areas have not gotten any worse either Certainly I donut notice hair in the shower or in my hair brush as muchOn the sexual function side of things I have noticed a decrease performance wise I guess there was always going to be a tradeoff The main thing I think to watch out for is the effect the medication has on PSA levels and if you are already being monitored for this prior to starting Propecia it is worth bearing in mind and reminding your physician about the PSA lowering effect of Propecia
6659,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,9,40674,124,At the tender age of I noticed that my hair was beginning to thin Not wanting to look like my dad or brother I got a prescription for Propecia So far its been working In fact if I miss a dosage Ill notice little bits of my hair fall into my keyboard or the pages of a book Im readingYes this medication is expensive My insurance wont cover it at all Funny that they cover Viagra though The only side effect is that I do notice a slight decrease in my sex drive but honestly thats probably good Keeps me out of trouble
6660,Propecia,Androgenetic Alopecia,9,40306,56,After month of using Propecia I noticed a decrease in the loss of hair after a shower Now in my th month of use there is a notable difference in the thickness of my hair and some growth noted
6662,Beyaz,Acne,9,42404,4,I started Beyaz in March of for my acne and now it is February it has almost been a year Ive had bad acne for about years before starting Beyaz I was on dermatologist prescribed medication but nothing was working as good as it I would hope About months after starting Beyaz I noticed improvement It was very slow improvement but now it is it beyond noticeable About halfway through the year of using Beyaz I started in a new environment which was college I thought this would make me break out Now months into college and I hardly ever have breakouts and I use less and less makeup For me Beyaz has changed my face completely I use to have multiple breakouts before and now I cant even remember the last pimple I had
6663,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,42373,4,I have been taking BeYaz for a year now to prevent pregnancy Because I have been taking it consistently at a scheduled time it has worked wonders I would recommend this pill to anyone that is sexually active Only side effects I have noticed are blood clots and emotional sensitivity highly recommend
6664,Beyaz,Birth Control,1,42369,1,BEYAZ is my WORST ENEMY I took this BC pill for months Completed week and the mood swings started Week I started bleeding light with minor cramps Week my light bleeding turned into heavy bleeding changing my pad every hour or less The cramps were no longer minor they were just unbearable that I had to take Norco and Ibuprofen at the same time just to take the edge off I spoke to my GYN about the symptoms and I was advise to give it another try even after I was in the ER injected with Dilaudid Started nd pack as the bleeding and cramping still continues Put on Vicodin and Naproxen for pain I became depressed angry isolated emotionally unattached and extremely tired I quit taking it mid way and now Im in recovery
6666,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,42233,7,So far its been a lot better than I expected I have been dreading going on hormonal birth control but after a failed experience with my Paragard IUD I gave Beyaz a try I havent gained any weight at all this was my biggest fear and Im so happy it didnt come true My stomach is flat and unbloated My boobs have increased in size they just feel nice and full but not sore Sometimes I do feel a little blue and my sex drive is definitely lower My libido is at about when I am with my boyfriend My acne has gotten much worse but they say this happens at first and then clear skin follows Period has been light and no cramps
6667,Beyaz,Birth Control,5,42181,3,When I first started taking Beyaz it was great I had no problems but towards the end of the cycle I had terrible attitude was very emotional nauseous and too many headaches Once my period was gone it came back a day after and it was light to medium Very bad cramps My appetite increased a lot more when I started But everyones body is different and would react different to the pills
6669,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,4,42159,3,I am and when I started this birth control I took it to relieve horrible periods due to what I believe is endometriosis with intense pain that lead to passing out and heavy bleeding horrible This pain has stopped which is great and my acne stayed about the same as before minor not any worse But the last month I have been on it a new symptom has arose that is causing me to switch the worst nausea I have ever had I take it at night and I wake up in the morning almost unable to do anything Also now get carsick and never have before and increased my anxiety I should mention I do have hashimotos thyroid disease which may contribute to my experience Will be switching to microgestin to see if I can be more comfortable
6670,Beyaz,Birth Control,7,42037,5,Ive been taking Beyaz for about years now I started when I was because of severe cramps It worked great for a while but in the last few months I have experienced spotting and longer periods with more severe cramps I am going to speak to a doctor about trying another pill
6671,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,42019,10,I feel wonderful taking Beyaz but its not perfect It really helped with moderate acne sometimes I would break out on my back and chest since taking I dont remember when I had a blemish I have no mood swings bloating or weight gain Im actually at my lowest weight Best thing my sex drive is great The only minus is my period still varies sometimes its heavy sometimes its light and Im still getting intensive cramps the first day but honestly I have no other issues and I can deal with it
6672,Beyaz,Acne,10,41989,9,After one month I began noticing a difference I was still getting breakouts but they were healing faster and were not painful anymore By two months I still was getting pimples but they were tiny and vanishing overnight Then after that it stopped all together I dont currently have a single pimple on my face and my post acne marks have had the chance to fade over the last three weeks Im finishing up my third month on the pill this week Side Effects At first I felt a bit drowsy had spotting the first two months and breast tenderness But these symptoms seem to be fading just like my acne I would strongly recommend this to anyone who thinks they may have hormonal acne I only wish I had tried it sooner
6673,Beyaz,Acne,8,41863,10,Beyaz was the second birth control I used In terms of acne it completely cleared my back chest and face acne However I have gained about pounds and am very active and cannot lose weight I also am irritable like no other I have terrible mood swings I loved that it cleared my acne but the mood swings and weight gain have to go so I am switching to Apri but if that doesnt work I would go back
6675,Beyaz,Acne,10,41830,30,I love Beyaz I was on Beyaz for years and decided to try a new pill Dumb I switched to another birth control for a year and broke out terribly battled depression and had inexplicable mood swings I switched back to Beyaz two months ago and my acne has cleared COMPLETELY after a month and a half my breasts grew a cup size and I am not gaining weight I am also a runner and was worried about the blood clot scandals with this medicine however I have never had a problem It is an incredible birth control pill for me and I absolutely LOVE it I am also a nurse from my understanding I want to note that many of the issues with blood clots are in HIGH RISK patients those who smoke who are over etc Take care of your body
6676,Beyaz,Acne,7,41772,12,I was prescribed Beyaz a year ago to control my acne and regulate my periods I was experiencing acne like never before and was having periods one month then none the next Beyaz did work It cleared up my acne However it made my periods very light inconsistent and only days long Call me crazy but I miss having day consistent periods With Beyaz my periods are so light tampons are painful to use and pads are too much protection But I have to wear something I have unexpected burstsflows during those days My periods also dont start until the last day of the pack Ive had to skip the last pill just so that my period would start Maybe Beyaz is too strong for my cycle but it did wonders for my acne
6678,Beyaz,Acne,9,41735,11,All I am going to say is my skin is flawless After the first months I used to have outbreaks and blemishes People always compliment me on how flawless my skin is and that I should do cover girl commercials Beyaz
6679,Beyaz,Birth Control,6,41687,15,I have been on Beyaz for several years When I first started using the pill I experienced frequent nausea for almost a year I gradually switched time of dosage to the evening upon recommendation from my obgyn The nauesa did clear up I virtually have no acne Within the first few years I did have lighter periods day bleeding with minimal cramping However in my fourth year of being on this pill I have been getting my period for only a day Most times I skip a period entirely This is due to the thin uterine lining I did however develop severe mood swings and panic attacks which I suffer from daily I also have had some hair thinning and some weight gain Loss of libido at first but it did return after the st year
6680,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,41682,6,Beyaz was the first birth control I experienced and I was on it for years It was nearly the perfect pill for me no weight change no mood swings I regulated to it immediately it dramatically shortened my periods to days and was exactly on time every single month The ONLY two problems I had that warranted me switching included a decreased sex drive and multiple yeast infections It was also a tad pricy If it werent for the yeast infections at least I would stay on it Im nervous about switching pills but Im glad to know that I can go back on Beyaz if the others dont work out
6682,Beyaz,Birth Control,4,41555,20,I started taking Beyaz about a month ago I was originally taking Microgestin for birth control for a little over a year and I started to experience extreme cramps that kept me from classes on some days I never had problems with acne or mood swings ever especially while on Microgestin Now that Im taking Beyaz I have very bad acne and feel very depressed and lack luster I normally have a very high sex drive as well and lately it has decreased immensely Needless to say I will be switching
6683,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,41536,33,Previously I was on Yaz for about years and my insurance didnt cover it so I switched to BeYaz I was on it for a good two years because its the same thing as Yaz Personally I love this birth control This is the only birth control for me I suffer from PMDD and this helps me tremendously And I also suffer from acne my skin cleared right up in a week Periods are better and shorter No weight gain or other side effects Perfect pill I highly recommend this birth control
6685,Beyaz,Acne,4,41528,5,I started birth control about a month ago for bad cramps and to regulate my period I never really had bad acne before but Ive been on Beyaz for a month now and my acne is bad I have at least large pimples on my face at all times which Im not used to I dont know if I should stick it out and see if it gets better or if I should switch to a different birth control Other than the acne Beyaz is really helping with my periods They last days at the most and little to no cramps at all
6688,Paxil CR,Anxiety,10,40084,20,I love it It works for me very well I take mg every morning
6690,Paxil CR,Panic Disorde,5,40025,20,Paxil CR helped control the anxiety and panic attacks It did allow me to live my life normally However I have had one big side effect Since January I have gained lbs It does not matter that I workout four or five days a week for or two hours and try to eat a healthy diet No matter what I did I continually gained weight My doctor has now taken me off of it due to the rapid weight gain I have experienced She felt that the rapid weight gain was not healthy and could lead to obesity if I did not quit taking the drug So I am going to come off of Paxil CR hopefully drop this excessive weight because I have never had a weight problem until now and I am years old and just go from there
6692,Paxil CR,Depression,1,39869,3,This medication was not helpful for my depression at all
6693,Paxil CR,Depression,8,39819,13,Ive been on Paxil CR for about months now I would highly recommend it My doctor decided to put me on it immediately after my suicide attempt Today I feel great have stopped crying and my suicidal thoughts are gone Only bad side effect is my lack of interest in sex
6694,Paxil CR,Anxiety,9,39632,28,I was taking Prozac for few years to treat my symptoms of depression but I could still feel anxiety and irrational fears like being alone in the house then my therapist suggested to switch to Paxil CR and my whole world has changed Im not scared anymore and I feel a lot better I am optimistic enthusiastic outgoing etc Paxil works for me
6695,Paxil CR,Anxiety,7,39536,43,I was taking Paxil for both depression and anxiety It worked very well for me for the past four years My husband could definitely tell the difference and if I missed a dose the effect was immediate However I was not aware that it could cause weight gain and I have gained over pounds even though I am eating healthy and exercising
6697,Paxil CR,Anxiety,10,42870,13,It will do nothing negative Give it a try to enjoy life Life is short Dont take the burden of social anxiety and panic attacks for your whole life If you still feel terrible when taking Paxil use inderal as well and you will see an improvement in life My score for Paxil CR is in just days PS if you ignore this illness it will give you IBS high BP anxiety messes with career goals gives heart problems sleep problems low energy you need short naps always low confidence and so on I avoided medicines from age to years and now finally I took the step for paxil Stay blessed
6698,Paxil CR,Anxiety,8,42650,1,After years on Paxil then years on Paxil CR I weaned myself off in months I had severe nausea and abdominal pain for months I am back on Paxil mgdaily under a Physician Assistants care to eventually wean off Nausea is gone as is the abdominal pain It was so bad for those three months I was hardly able to function because of the extreme nausea
6699,Paxil CR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,1,42613,4,I was prescribed Paxil CR for GAD which was mostly situational I cannot tell you how awful of an experience it was for me My anxiety went through the roof to the point I didnt want to leave home which is not like me at all I became very depressed which I wasnt to start out with Crying uncontrollably Pacing and restless could NOT sit still Went from pounds to in weeks No appetite intrusiveracingall negative thoughts couldnt sleep for more than an hour or two at a time paranoid confused no concentration no motivation sweating constant diarrhea jaw clenching stomach pains body aches dry mouth yawning and dizziness After days on this med my doctor pulled the plug because I was better before it
6702,Paxil CR,Anxiety,8,42533,6,Am able to drive around town way better but not on freeways or bridges Sometimes feel dizzy when tired or overexerting Doing more fun stuff
6704,Paxil CR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,9,42480,6,Prior to getting on the aropax I started having anxiety symptoms from nowhere The meds have improved my quality of life quite a bit
6705,Paxil CR,Depression,8,42269,6,It was pretty efficientwithin months i had been out of my acute depressive episode and full of lifei hadnt experienced any increase in apetite as i was warned and in fact it helped with my IBS a lotI was started on mgday then mgday for around months after which I sought my doctor for Mania symtpoms i was experiencingvery talktative juggling thoughts very rapid tone and rush of ideas when speaking and most importantly insomnia anyhow we had to emergency stop it mg for weeks then mg for one and then nothingWORST experience in the world its very physically debilitating nausea dizziniess wierd feeling ON my headhad to take xanax to combat the withdrawal symptoms couldnt leave the house for mnoths
6706,Paxil CR,Depression,10,42167,37,I tried so many medications before like prozac and zoloft I cant remember the rest but they made me sick or suicidal Ive been on Paxil CR for yrs and never increased and it is the best one for me I cannot live my life without paxil It has made me a better person mother sister and friend
6707,Paxil CR,Panic Disorde,2,42023,11,Made my depression and anxiety worse Caused more instances of suicidal ideation
6708,Paxil CR,Panic Disorde,10,41847,32,Paxil CR has made a great impact on my quality of life I started menopause and was dealing with stressful family health issues both beginning at the same time I begin to suffer from panic attacks and was overly sensitive to EVERYTHING I was taking Lexapro which did not help at all Paxil CR has been a God send for me
6709,Paxil CR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,10,41540,75,I have been dealing with anxiety all my life I thought that was how everyone lived Last year I had a debilitating episode of anxiety and finally sought help After hearing my history the doctors wanted me to get on SSRIs asap I resisted at first due to fears but eventually relented Started with mg a day of Paxil was on that does for three months and I still had some anxiety Went up to mg and after the new dose kicked in I have never felt better It has been a year at mgs and my anxiety is gone not just health anxiety but social anxiety money anxiety My mind finally works the way it was meant to and I owe it all to Paxil
6712,Paxil CR,Depression,7,41478,20,Before I started taking Paxil CR I felt I couldnt function when Dr started me at a small dose until he found the right dose for me to take and then I felt normal again
6713,Paxil CR,Depression,3,41469,17,HUGE weight gain From lbs up to lbs and there didnt seem to be any way to lose the weight I am not an eater or a snacker if anything I cant manage breakfast and I eat a healthy sandwich for lunch and can only manage the meal that my husband eats at night For me depression loss of appetite
6714,Paxil CR,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,9,41443,21,I was prescribed Paxil mg for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder Ive been taking it for two weeks and I feel so much better It also helps with my social anxiety as well I feel calmer centered and more assertive It makes me less emotional and somewhat experience quotflat effectquot which could be bad in certain situations In first two days I felt very nauseated and couldnt eat and lost pounds however I noticed my appetite has increased and Im watching my weight So far so goodNote SSRIs works differently on premenstrual women and improvements is seems in the very first cycle at least in my case
6717,Paxil CR,Depression,6,40551,17,After unsuccessful medications this one made me the most balanced and even
6718,Paxil CR,Depression,10,40343,10,I have had great success with the use of this medicine One thing I would tell people is if you have problems sleeping on this medicine talk to your doctor first and foremost I did talk with my doctor and I am also taking another medicine to help with that I have Bipolar disorder with manic tendencies Depakote Paxil CR and Risperidone for me all together works Anyone looking at this I hope it helps with your treatment process with the guidance of your doctor Good luck
6719,Paxil CR,Depression,7,40218,19,I have been on Paxil CR for a little over a month I have previously taken Zoloft Lexapro and Prozac and none of them worked as well as this drug I was constantly agitated on the Lexapro and Prozac and they didnt seem to help with the depression Zoloft just made me feel weird Each drug is different for each person but this one works the best for me so far I feel calm and happy during the day The only problem with it for me and it is a big one is that I cant sleep I will spend hours in bed with my eyes open tired but unable to actually fall asleep I then have a hard time waking up but once I do then I am awake and not groggy I am going to talk to my Doctor about it and hopefully he will have a solution
6720,Paxil CR,Depression,5,40108,8,This drug no longer works for me because of a job loss I have gone down hill ever since I lost my job in early September
6721,Beyaz,Birth Control,1,43067,0,This drug can create absolutely horrible stomach problems I went from having no stomach issues to horrible IBS all due to BeyazMy sister was on the same birth control while I was on this drug and was also experiencing the same symptoms I got an IUD and went off Beyaz and my stomach started feeling better However it took almost months for my body to fully recover Horrible side effects for a birth control would not recommend it to anyone
6723,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,43052,1,Ive been on this birth control for about weeks now and let me explain Ive never been on birth control before I experienced just about no side effects so far no unusual weight gain headaches or cravings No bad mood swings and it already helping my acne the reason I went on it The downfall Ive been bleeding for the whole weeks Ive been on it I started it the day of my period as instructed usually I bleed for days but I have had my period now for weeks straight I think its getting light and about to go away and then I wake up the next morning and back again If this side effect continues into the next pack I may have to give up beyaz I am on the generic by the way
6726,Beyaz,Acne,9,42962,0,In the beginning I was emotional and all over the place amp I also broke out I am now near the three end mark and my skin has improved tremendously I do have scars and Ive never been one to get scars from picking at pimples but Im not sure if the pills had something to do with it or picking at them did Other than that all the side effects have subsided and my skin is the clearest it has been in a loooong long time
6727,Beyaz,Birth Control,5,42879,3,I started Beyaz about months ago The first months were greatno acneno cryingno anger or crazy mood swings The last or months have been bad though My face started breaking out I am very emotional and angry I dont know if its because my pharmacy started giving me the generic version or its the hormones but everything was great until recently
6728,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,42814,15,I have a history of depressionanxiety which Im currently treating w medication I also have had symptoms of PMDD in the past Beyaz is the ONLY birth control I have tried that completely takes away the PMDD clears my face hasnt made me gain weight etc I love it When a generic for Beyaz came out Rajani I tried it for months and each month two days before starting my period I had terrible PMDD episodes with extreme depression anxiety cramping migraines Im going back to Beyaz
6729,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,42745,3,I switched to Beyaz about years ago after being on OrthoNovum The first months was tough I recall having irritability fatigue discolored complexion breakthrough bleeding during sex etc After that transition I felt fine About years ago my period began being lighter and lighter and evenutally went away I asked my GYN if it was ok and she assured me that Beyaz may eliminate my period At first I was displeased because I wanted a period to prove that I wasnt pregnant each month But when my gyno told me she can put me on something else to force a period I told her no Now with the new year I discovered that my new RX plan doesnt cover ANY of the BEYAZRAJANISAFYRAL contraceptives Im DOOMED
6730,Beyaz,Acne,1,42717,0,Broke my face out horribleevery where my face was covered with acne I was on it for months and I regret it so much I would only get a zit every now and then I stopped the pill my face is better but I have horrible scarring everywhere My face was so pretty and this pill ruined it
6731,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,42715,6,I have been taking beyaz for years And I love it I take it religiously Same time everyday I have had no problems with it in fact my periods have became lighter since taking it Which I love because I hated my period And my face is so clear I had bad acne before I started it and I get compliments all the time now about how clear and smooth my face is And I would recommend this pill to someone who knows they can take it on time everyday who wants to get rid of their acne and who doesnt want any kids
6733,Beyaz,Acne,9,42673,5,Beyaz saved my skin Literally I always had nice skin as a teenager with the occasional mild breakout But about months after I turned I broke out in hormonal acne It legitimately covered my entire face except the sides of my cheeks I seriously tried everything before my mom finally suggested birth control I was skeptical because I feared I would gain weight but desperate for clean skin again I decided to try it My doctor told me it would probably make my skin worse before it made it better which it did but after months I saw good results Now at a little over months my skin is almost as clear as it was before It takes a little bit of time but its so worth it It also didnt effect my weight So grateful for Beyaz
6734,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,42649,5,It took months for everything to regulate but now that Ive been on it for almost a year I love it My cramps arent as bad bleeding is much lighter than it used to be hormones are times more steady and best of all only periods per year Only drawback is that I get random menstruallike cramps but theyre very light dont even need to take ibuprofen its more of a small annoyance than anything I havent gained weight but my face has broken out some over the past months it didnt for the longest time so Im not sure whether theres a correlation to the Beyaz or not I take it at night because if I take any kind of birth control in the morning I feel extremely dizzynauseous all day Overall an awesome choice
6735,Beyaz,Birth Control,5,42621,2,Ive been on Beyaz going on years now Good thing about this birth control is it does the job No babies no bad acne super light periods here and there However Ive been experiencing mood swings lately I will cry and cry and cry till I cant cry no more Im so mean to people nowwhich is crazy because Im usually people personish most of the time It makes me super hot at night and makes my chest feel heavier than usual Its cool for keeping weight down acne and no babies I just think Beyaz has ran its course for my body
6737,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,42614,3,I had been using the pill for years I used the first version of this pill yaz then switched to byaz when it came out I went about my life for a few years and then considered switching to Ashlyan which is just one period every months Well let me tell you having only one period every months is MAGICAL Unfortunately my acne went full force months into the new pill my entire face was broken out I was using the strong topical prescription available amp still just getting worse I was at my lowest when I realized the problem was probably the pill I spoke with my doc amp we decided I could switch back to byaz and just get extra packs a year and still get only period every months month into byaz amp My face is clear again
6739,Beyaz,Birth Control,1,42579,1,Beyaz didnt work for me My GYN put my on this pill because I wasnt ovulating This pill turned out to be my worst nightmare The first week I became very emotional and light menstrual bleeding and cramps The second week my bleeding became heavier and cramps turned into preassure in my lower abdominal area The pressure made me so uncomfortable No medicine helped Called my GYN office and spoke with her nurse She suggested doubling up on the meds I was currently taking That helped some but not much The third week the bleeding became extreme with large blood clots Having to wear huge pads at a time was awful And the pressure turned back into pain I called my GYN back they advised me to stop the pill immediately
6740,Beyaz,Acne,10,42569,3,From years old until my current age I used to have oily skin and allover breakouts on my face and upper back I was on Proactiv forever and finally was fed up with the ridiculous cost and little results I asked my doc to put my on a BC that would address my acne issue and she chose Beyaz I have never had terrible deep cystic acne but rather constant red bumpspimples and under the skin bumps The first months of taking Beyaz I noticed less above the skin acne but more deep painful bumps However after the month mark my skin DRASTICALLY improved Its smooth and clear I get an occasional breakout here and there but holy smokes I have no negative outcomes no weight gain and no crazy hormonal outbursts TRY THIS
6741,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,42551,2,Overall this was a good pill for me The only reason I stopped taking it was because i wanted to switch to a form of birth control that i didnt have to take everyday At first for maybe the first two weeks I felt more depressed but after that I felt the same as usual I did spot through pretty much the whole second month BUT that has happened with every birth control I have been on so I think it is just my body There was also a mild increase in acne toward the end of the first pack but it went away and my skin became very clear This pill was also helpful for excess hair growth that i have in certain areas It was a helpful pill for my pms symptoms and to regulate my periods
6742,Beyaz,Acne,9,42534,4,I was on Loloestrin Fe for about years before switching to Beyaz I loved Loloestrin but randomly started breaking out all over my neck and chin After trying every topical solution out there I finally decided to switch pills although I was terrified of gaining weight Im now on my second month of Beyaz and it has literally been the best thing to ever happen to me I broke out pretty bad at first but my acne has DRAMATICALLY improved I actually lost weight my libido is up and no dramatic mood swings The only thing is is that Ive been spotting between my periods but thats expected the first couple months Also Ill have random nausea but it quickly goes away Everyones different but give Beyaz a try It may change your life
6745,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,42409,8,I have been on Beyaz birth control for about years now and I have never really had any serious problems with it As a birth control it seems to be working great no babies here Ive never really had any acne however I used to get random pimples on my thighs which was so strange to me but when I started Beyaz they quickly disappeared My breasts have grown a substantial amount but I do not have bad bloating or weight gain in other areas which is awesome The only downside I have noticed to this medication is that my mood swings were terrible the first couple weeks This is normal when you give your body any extra hormones so I was not too worried about it The mood swings stopped about weeks in
6746,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,41502,18,Being on Beyaz has been for the most part fantastic I originally was put on it to control my acne and heavy periods and shortly after I began using it for birth control It has continued to help with my acne and has lightenedshortened my periods significantly but over the past year or so Ive noticed a vast decrease in my sex drive Its almost nonexistent I havent been on any other form of birth control but I think that Beyaz is a pretty good choice
6748,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,41473,62,I have been on Beyaz for months now after being diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome I have lost lbs in the last months my mood is better my face has cleared up dramatically I would recommend this to ANYONE
6751,Beyaz,Acne,3,41357,14,This pill has made my acne much worse and given me bad depression I have noticed slight weight gain and worsening of allergies
6752,Beyaz,Acne,8,41346,6,I have been taking Beyaz for years I havent really gained weight on it I just have a harder time losing weight but thats nothing that working out and eating right didnt fix Anyway I started taking Beyaz for birth control purposes and for acne It definitely has helped with both I got off of it for a couple months and as soon as I did my acne came right back Needless to say I got right back on it I dont have nausea or anything I take it at night instead of in the morning Only side effects I have are dehydration and sometimes Im more hungry than I should be I just try to eat healthy snacks and drink more water I am more tired on the pill than off but I just try to drink tea or something when I feel too tired and get sleep
6753,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,41344,8,I have been on Beyaz for a year and half and Ive loved it I had moderate acne before taking Beyaz and now I only breakout like once a month its usually only pimples My period went from a mediumheavy days to light days I hardly have cramps or bloating I love it I sometimes get a little emotional but I contribute that to being years old The only real negative side effect that I could say that I have about Beyaz is that its somewhat costly my insurance doesnt cover it But since Ive loved all that its done for me I choose to pay it I would definitely recommend this anyone looking for a new birth control
6754,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,7,41304,11,I have been on this pill for months going in and have had my ups and downs with it The month I experianced intense mood swings I was crying and angry all the time and just wanted to be alone The month I was wondering why my acne wasnt going away but my moods had improved Although I was experiencing breakthrough bleeding for days I continued to take the pill My period also brought cramps like no other The months I have been feeling sort of depressed but I think thats due to life not the pill My breakthrough bleeding still occurred some days light some days none and my skin has improved I lost weight on BeYaz I am looking forward to what month brings and hoping all of the negative symptoms are gone
6755,Beyaz,Birth Control,6,41277,22,I have been on BeYaz for months now I was switched from a normal hormone birth control because it caused terrible breakouts which I had never had in my life as well as severe mood swings At first I really liked BeYaz It cleared my skin back up to normal and I didnt notice any changes Now I am starting to get extremely agitated at the smallest things crying for no reason extreme headaches and am getting cramps like I used to without birth control I am considering getting off birth control altogether
6757,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,41237,7,Ive been taking Beyaz for a year now and so far I like it better than anything Ive ever took It treated my moderate acne I never get any acne anymore
6758,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,10,41212,26,I have had horrible periods since my very first one and they got worse as I aged My cramps got so bad that muscle relaxants and pain killers didnt even take the edge off of the pain My hormones were worse Had maybe days out of the month that I was fine Not to mention the amount I would bleed was horrible I started with Yaz and was switched to Beyaz after my periods stopped coming My periods didnt come back because the pill caused my body to stop producing a lining of my uterus so now I take them continuously I love this pill For two years I was great and had no PMDD symptoms whatsoever I will never use any other pill
6759,Beyaz,Acne,7,41165,11,Im and started having acne and needed to go back on birth control The great news is my skin cleared up completely within months on Beyaz The bad news is Ive been taking the pill for a little over months and Im still having my period twice a month each lasting between days Definitely not ideal but theyre usually pretty light I havent noticed any weight gain but I do work out intensively days a week Lately Ive been noticing a lot more mood swings low selfesteempoor body image and I have a tremendous amount of guilt about everyday things and a bit of depression I increased my antidepressant and that has seemed to help with the depression aspect but not the other symptoms
6761,Beyaz,Birth Control,7,41110,21,I was prescribed Beyaz after being diagnosed finally with Polycystic ovarian syndrome After three months Ive lost roughly fifteen pounds I actually get my period which for me is a good thing and I see no other side effects past that that werent bringing the changes from being put on progestin back to normal If you have PCOS or similar symptoms Id recommend researching it further
6762,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,10,41104,24,I switched from Yaz to Beyaz because Yaz got too expensive I decided to try it because I could no longer afford Yaz and the results were much better than expected No cramps nice skin and my period is always right on time like Yaz but with a few added benefits When I was on Yaz the week before my period I would always get bloated in the stomach area and would be self conscious about it Also about days before my period my appetite increased so much that I couldnt stop eating On Beyaz there is no bloating and it curbs my appetite so much that Ive lost some weight on it I also used to get extremely fatigued around my period on Yaz to the point where it was hard to wake up but on Beyaz I feel more energetic than ever before
6765,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,41045,13,I started taking Beyaz after trying Lo Loestrin Fe that made me terribly sick My friend had recommended it to me I had no side effects and my period is only like or days long Theres no tiredness or mood swings before I get my period either No spotting no increase in acne My sex drive has stayed the same My mood has been so much lighter Beyaz is great I would recommend it to anyone that has had problems with other birth control pills Its a miracle
6766,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,41044,10,Im just starting my rd week of BeYaz and after reading some of the scary side effects I was very hesitant to take it My doctor assured me that it was safe and that it was one of her favorite pills amp she actually took it herself The first few days were ok then I started noticing I got nauseous about an hour after taking it I was taking it in the evening a few hours after dinner My mother suggested taking it with yogurt So I switched and began taking it at lunch with a yogurt and I have had no additional nausea I have been more tired than normal but due to other things going on right now I cant be certain that is from the pill Overall so far Ive had a good experience with this pill amp Im glad my doctor recommended it
6767,Beyaz,Birth Control,4,41010,5,I was prescribed this medicine to help with my erratic periods It was great at first About eight months into it I became anemic from heavy bleeding and had nine day periods instead of four Ive also experienced spotting eight months into taking it
6768,Beyaz,Birth Control,5,41004,7,I have been on Beyaz for a week now Before that I had an IUD which was removed after four years because of severe pain The only side effect I really notice at this point is nausea throughout the day and I feel tired all day I have a history of depression and anxiety with panic attacks I dont notice any difference with those symptoms so far The nausea is really bad around the afternoon every day even though I take it at night Since this is only my first week Im going to stick it out and see what happens this month
6769,Beyaz,Birth Control,4,40992,13,Ive been on Beyaz for almost a year Since them Ive gone through times of weight gain and loss which could just be my bodys normal function Recently I have noticed aversions to certain foods nausea severe migraines and lack of sleep I havent noticed a change in sex drive My skin in flawless but recently Ive had severe migraines
6770,Beyaz,Birth Control,6,40977,8,I use to be on Yaz until the price got so high I switched to a different one for a few months had awful side effects so my year check up came and my doctor recommended Beyaz I have been on it for almost a year And my sex drive is almost completely gone and Im more moody on the pill than off Its crazy But I dont have any headaches anymore Had no weight gain and no cramping or back aches on my period
6772,Beyaz,Birth Control,1,40975,9,The first birth control I was on I gained lbs in months my doctor switched me to Yaz I had no weight loss and no side effects other then a decrease in my sexual drive three months ago I started taking Beyaz I have gained lbs in months of taking it Nothing in my daily routine has changed to make me gain that kind of weight
6773,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,10,40968,11,I love Beyaz No weight gain at all and Ive been on it for almost a year Clear skin No mood swings although I feel emotional right before my period but Ive always been that way The only negative thing is I used to be on the Bayer card and paid dollars but now it went up to
6777,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,40947,8,The only reason I got on Beyaz was because I developed very large ovarion cysts My doctor recommended the pill to reduce ovulation wihich would only make the cyst bigger I was scared that I was going to gain weight At first I hated the pill because I bleed very lightly for an entire month My doctor said that was normal for the first month Then I noticed that my skin was clearing up really nicely I didnt notice any weight gain but the best part was Beyaz sorted my monthly cramps I was so relieved The only thing I can say that I dont like about Byaz is that if I miss a pill and take it when I remember it seems like over the next or days my acne flares up really bad and I hate that Just stay consistent I recommend it
6778,Beyaz,Birth Control,7,40944,5,Ive been taking Beyaz for about a week now and it has been great The only side effect Ive really had a problem with are intense cravings None of the other side effects clearer skin increased libido have been a problem to me in the slightest I would say that starting to take Beyaz was a wonderful choice
6780,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,40928,14,Beyaz was the third birth control pill I had tried I was previously on Loestrin made me a raving lunatic then on Lo Loestrin gave me no period at all which made me uncomfortable and more susceptible to vaginal infections I was skeptical about starting a new pill but this one is wonderful The only side effects I have are tender and enlarged breasts I highly recommend it
6782,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,40919,9,This is my first time on the pill and I dont have anything negative to say about Beyaz No side effects that I am aware of which is such a relief
6783,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,40918,9,I have been on Beyaz for almost weeks more for endometriosis So far I am tired all the time my breasts have increased a size and are constantly sore I am hot most of the time I am normally cold and my sex drive has increased I was placed on this because I am having unbearable cramping and pain when having sex I am unable to afford the Laproscopy at this time so my doctor has placed me on Beyaz The pains have gone from an to about a YAY So far I have not had any pains during sex I know that I still need to have this procedure and that this pill will not eliminate the problem but it is a great help Just wish the pain in my breast would stop
6793,Beyaz,Acne,9,40876,5,After using Beyaz only for a month I have already seen a dramatic improvement in my acne I have been suffering with acne for over a year and this birth control seems to be working Ium so excited Only other side effects I have are occasional migraines and fatigue But Im hoping it will lessen as my body adjusts
6794,Beyaz,Birth Control,7,40868,2,Ive only been taking Beyaz for a week but I have noticed a slight decrease in appetite Ive had minor headaches and feeling bloated I just hope I dont gain weight the other pill I was on made me gain pounds
6795,Beyaz,Birth Control,6,40868,6,Gained TWELVE pounds in the first weeks I dont get it That is my only side effect but it is a bad one I already eat healthy and work out regularly and I cant seem to drop this weight from the pill
6796,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,40867,13,I have only been on Beyaz for a week but I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT decrease in appetite I have already lost weight on this pill So far I have noticed increased minor headaches and nausea the first few days So far I really like this pill the last pill I was on made me gain weight and I was very emotional Hope it continues to be a good a pill for me
6797,Beyaz,Birth Control,6,40854,1,For years I was on Yaz I stopped when I got pregnant and waited over a year to get back on the pill I couldnt handle even general PMS bloating cramping achy body emotional roller coaster breakouts not to mention feeling tired and irritable So I went to my OBGYN to get back on Yaz but she prescribed BeYaz instead
6798,Beyaz,Birth Control,1,40828,19,Ive been on Yaz for years and like most people I switched to Beyaz because of the saving card Ive only been on it for a month I have NOT stopped bleedingspotting since I got my last period Ive tried different birth control over the years and I NEVER had this problem before If this is the same as Yaz I dont understand why Im having this issue I thought about trying it another month but Im not sure I can handle bleeding for days if this continues
6799,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,40801,55,I love Beyaz The only side effects I have experienced is increase in breast size increased sex drive and clearer skin I would strongly recommend trying it And definitely ask your doctor for the Bayer savings card that makes your first prescription and only for the rest of your prescriptions I have no prescription insurance coverage so it is fantastic for me because I will never have to pay over Hopefully it is as great for you as it is to me
6802,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,10,40794,17,I was diagnosed with PMDD back in when I was I have ruined a few good relationships and was finally getting tired of feeling out of control a week out of every month I tried Yaz and loved it but my insurance quit paying for it so I switched to Beyaz It seems to work well I havent had any symptoms of the PMDD since I have been taking it
6805,Beyaz,Birth Control,4,40759,1,I recently switched to Beyaz and since then Ive had awful breakouts on my face I never got pimples before when I was on Ortho TriCyclen Im switching back
6806,Beyaz,Birth Control,2,40755,9,I was taking Yaz and it worked amazing for me but about months ago I was put on Beyaz and have had a yeast infection both months I have not had sex in over months this is the only possible explanation for my yeast infections
6807,Beyaz,Birth Control,1,40753,13,I have been on Beyaz for a little over a week and I feel like a crazy person Like so many of the comments Ive read I also switched from Yaz to Beyaz after its Bayer Savers Program expired Now I have headaches almost daily and am extremely moody Its terrible
6808,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,40751,20,I was on Loestrin FE for years and I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder while I was in high school Loestrin worked for a little bit but I gained pounds quick I still had sexual desire mentally but my body wouldnt react and I was always too tired or to moody or to emotional And since Ive been on it for a while the side effects seemed like they hit me a second time and it was like my period was playing peekaboo with me But months ago I switched to Beyaz and Ive never been more happy and morewellattacking my fiance I give Beyaz a and highly recommend it And Im
6809,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,40743,13,I just finished month of Beyaz and am hoping things get better after month I have had just about every side effect that has been listed except for the mood swings I have gained quite a bit of weight In the first few weeks of taking Beyaz I was very nauseous and vomited a few times I have daily headaches I have zero sex drive and the thought of sex makes me ill when I am usually very sexually active Thank goodness I have an understanding partner I am unbelievably tired no matter how much sleep I get I normally have acne on a regular basis but it hasnt gotten worse but I am patiently waiting for it to get better I will continue to take Beyaz as recommended by my doctor for at least another months and hope things get better
6810,Beyaz,Acne,8,40739,17,I have seen an improvement in my skin after only a week being on Beyaz
6811,Beyaz,Birth Control,6,40730,5,I have been on Beyaz for about weeks after switching from yaz due to cost Now and I feel more bloated depressed and have experienced weight gain I have also had headaches I havent had a real period in several months since Yaz would just make me have cramping not actually bleeding I even have taken tests to ensure I wasnt pregnant because I wasnt bleeding Im not sure if the same thing works for Beyaz or not I just hope my body adapts to this and I start to lose weight again and get energy back
6812,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,40728,2,I just started taking it and i am one week into it and I have already gained pounds because my hunger has increased But other than that it is a great pill
6815,Beyaz,Birth Control,8,40708,5,Ive been on Beyaz for month Its the first kind Ive tried and its worked pretty good for me so far The only problem is that I have moments where I get extremely moody My hunger has increased and I get headaches more often than usual Also towards the end of the pack I started spotting a lot Other than that Im happy with it The side effects arent too bad so I cant complain They will probably go away since Ive only been on it for a month and my bodys still getting used to it
6816,Beyaz,Birth Control,3,40696,12,I have been on Beyaz for only days My doctor recommended it knowing that I am a smoker but Im only I already had a tubal ligation so Beyaz is for hormones and acne I feel very nauseous and have severe migraines loss of appetite extremely tired also I have a nasty taste in my mouth that just wont go away no matter how much I brush floss or mouthwash Im not sure if I could handle these side effects being a and working full time I have to have the most energy as possible These side effects dont help
6818,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,40689,32,The birth control pills I tried before Beyaz made me so emotionally crazy My academics and social life crumbled to pieces After stopping those pills my Gyno suggested Beyaz since I have a history of anxiety and depression and I am SO glad he did Because of my history and how hormones mess with those conditions if Beyaz had the same mentally severe side effects I would be forced to forgo birth control altogether But now my life is back on track and I deal with no emotional or hormonal effects from this pill no nausea no weight gain and only headaches that went away after months Thank you BEYAZ
6820,Beyaz,Birth Control,9,40659,15,Ive been on Beyaz for almost a month now I really like it So far Ive had no side effects THATS GREAT I was on two other birth controls and they made me gain weight and made my acne get ten times worse and did not help my cramps and I got badly depressed Since taking Beyaz my acne has not gone away completely but has not got worse I have not had any side effects so far I love it
6821,Beyaz,Acne,9,40650,27,This birth control pill dramatically reduces moderate acne
6823,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,9,40626,32,I have been taking Beyaz for about months now I had PMDD extremely bad for weeks out of the month A month after starting Beyaz I had no symptoms at all I had irregular periods and now they are on time every month I am very happy with the results and I would recommend Beyaz to anyone Especially if they experience PMDD
6828,Beyaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorde,9,40607,33,I have been on Beyaz for months now I have had problems with other birth controls in the past such as large amounts of weight gain moodiness etc I havent had any of these problems with Beyaz in fact I havent gained ANY weight on it It has helped my PMDD greatly I went from having cramps that would knock out an elephant to having almost no cramping at all and I dont get moody or bloated like I have on other birth controls
6829,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,40591,20,Love BEYAZ I was taking YAZ and LOVED that too I do have breast tenderness with this pill and havent with other pills in the past I still give it a because I feel great on this pill
6831,Beyaz,Birth Control,10,40546,94,I am years old and started taking Beyaz a few months ago I was extremely hesitant about taking this because I was so SO afraid of gaining weight I have taken other pills in the past that have caused weight gain nausea bloating etc but this pill has proven me wrong I have had no side effects its actually a bit shocking So glad my doctor recommended this to me
6834,Glucophage XR,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40081,14,The first week of taking Metformin Glucophage I was extremely sick But after that intail first week of taking the pill I was better I take mg in the morning and at night making that mg a day So far it hasnt given me any issues Havent noticed much weight loss but so far I am happy with it

6836,Glucophage XR,Diabetes Type 2,10,39941,184,I started glucophage xr on February I can not believe how much better I feel Before glucophage I spent every waking minute thinking about what I would eat next For the last years I stayed under calories a day and my readings were or I was up and down like a yoyo all day and night I gained weight constantly I weighed in at lbs on Feb Now months later on glucophage I have lost lbs and I eat like a normal person I cant believe the difference The first week on it I had some nausea but it went away and I now have no side effects I keep thinking this is a fluke a pill cant make that much of a difference I feel better than I have in years I now have energy because I am eating enough and my readings are amazing
6837,Glucophage XR,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,39891,38,I started taking this medication for PCOS I would suggest the XR to help with the side effects Stick to it because the side effects are bad the first weeks but after that it gets easier

6851,Prevnar 13,Pneumococcal Disease Prophylaxis,1,42677,3,Within a few days of the Prevnar injection my left knee became very painful limited mobility requiring ice Motrin and rest It lasted weeks and spontaneously resolved Then my right knee started in the same manner but much worse and lasted weeks before spontaneously resolving I did not have any injuries or change in activities to cause this in both knees there was NEVER any swelling just pain and limited mobility
6852,Prevnar 13,Pneumococcal Disease Prophylaxis,1,42618,8,My rheumatologist had me take it during a routine visit Had not been taking any ra medshumeria and methotrexate for five months since i felt better and didnt feel i had it anymore I had almost continous respitory infections while on these medications The nurse told me it would sting and my arm would hurt for a few days That was the least of my worries By that evening i had chills a fever and rash Could not even get out of bed the next day and go go work which is very rare for me Went to work the next day and had a terrible honking unproductive cough and was wheezing and felt like I couldnt catch my breathe I called my doctor and she prescribed a medrol pack Helped somewhat but then ended up with a sinus infection
6853,Prevnar 13,Pneumococcal Disease Prophylaxis,1,42449,12,When I was in my s I had a pneumonia shot and they said I would never need another one My doctor insisted I have this new one I didnt want it and he knew it but a nurse was standing there with the shot and I let them administer it in my upper right arm towards the back The same day my arm was useless and I had to hold on to it as it hurt so bad I kept trying to get into the doc but was turned down I only lived a block away and went into his office but would not see me This was guessing a year and some ago My arm hurt that much for a week and then started to be able to move it But the shoulder joint of that arm is still very painful I am in therapy for my right arm Rapid heatbeat and breathing too

6856,Prevnar 13,Pneumococcal Disease Prophylaxis,1,42251,25,Most painful injection in my life Felt like a screwdriver being shoved in my arm Shot was given very high on my arm and I believe it went into shoulder joint min after given I experienced severe low back pain and after almost months I have severe pain when abducting my arm I have taken a round of Keflex from my FNP
6857,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42856,4,I had no problem with hyperhidrosis until I passed the age of Then it suddenly became a huge problem Perimenopause perhaps I began sweating profusely and became very selfconscious about my body odor I tried many different antiperspirantsdeodorants including quotclinical strengthquot They would work for a short time then stop working I mentioned this to my nurse practitioner and she suggested I try this It really works I will admit the itchingtinglingstinging is annoying but worth dealing with to have dry pits I used Hypercare for a few years but recently was prescribed Drysol They seem to work equally well and have the same side effects for me
6859,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,42844,15,I sweat mostly everywhere Pits arent the only place Its my face chest back of my thighs groin area hands feet you get it Ive been like this since puberty n it got a lot worse of course after I started working out regularly I use Drysol mostly on my armpits maybe twice a week n I dont sweat at all I apply it very lightly n only directly where I actually perspire from the center of my pit n then rub it around a little by doing a circular funky chickenlike movement For everywhere else I only use it maybe once a month its effective for a couple of days For my face forehead nose n very lightly above my upper lip I use a cotton ball as the applicator dispenses too much at a time The itchiness is killer tho
6862,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42811,21,I began sweating as soon as I started college probably from the mass amount of stress Im always under Any who this product is amazing I literally would be sitting in a normal temperature room and sweat would just be streaming from my arm pits down the sides of my body I started using this and from day absolutely no sweat Not even at the gym It does sting a little bit but as far as Im concerned a little bit of stinging far outweighs the low self confidence paranoia and constant clamminess of my body I recommend this product to anyone
6863,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42807,9,Drysol works very well If you let your underarms completely dry either by themselves or with a blowdryer on low setting there should be no irritation If there is any continuous itching or burning simply watch your armpits and dry them Use sparingly
6865,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42769,7,This stuff is a life changer I was prescribed this about years ago and have used it ever since I would pour sweat under my arms and could be freezing coldI was determined to find something that helped I tried all the expensive deodorants at the store and none of them workedI finally told my Dr and he prescribed me this Yes it burns and hurts at first but eventually you wont need to apply it but maybe a couple of times a month and never apply it the same day you shaveit doesnt hurt burn or irritate me at all anymore and still no sweatingdont know what I would do if I could no longer get this
6866,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42764,19,When I was in middle school it is hard if you have hyperhidrosis Your self confidence is way low and I can NEVER wear shirts without a jacket over it to hide the pit stains It really did suck I started using drysol in the sixth grade because of my excessive sweating and its been helping ever sense The first week of using it there is going to be itching but after a few days it should be fine Do not use it after shaving or dont put too much on and thats what will cause the burning sensation everyones talking about Use a small amount dry it via air or a hair dryer and you should be fine to go to bed There is no point in using this product every single night I suggest it
6867,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,42762,13,Im a university student who suffers from hyperhydrosis Ive had it for a few years ever since puberty hit Its always embarressing having sweat stains always feels like someone is staring I always keep my arms down once I noticed they are there Will never even raise my hand in class or reach the top of my locker so I dont raise my arms No other antiperspirant worked and Im too young for botox Certain dry didnt work either I tried this went from doing it every other night to once or twice a week Was itchy at first but now nothing But I was so happy I could not be embarrassed anymore I could wear whatever I wanted and buy whatever Though I did notice some BO come back so I used some natural deodorant along with it Changed my life
6868,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42761,0,Excessive Sweat effect us all differently but thing that stays the same is that everyone with hyperhidrosis usually hates physical activities social situations anxiety and any type of heat that makes us sweat more Perspiration pretty much controls our lives and forces us to seek other means of hyperhidrosis treatments like the surgery natural treatments or a antiperspirant The problem is that there is so many products and treatments for excessive sweating that its hard to figured out the right one for me I liked Certain Dri because it gives me many types of products to choose from It also give me hours of protection with only one application Make sure that you start with the lowest percentage of aluminium and move up from there
6869,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42761,20,Ive had hyperhidrosis for as long as I can remember years old my mom noticed first My problem areas are my hands and feet now but growing up and going to school was a total MESS for me I hated it The equivelant to that are my job interviews now I developed social anxiety and anxiety in general I ruined so many pairs of shoes and I could never wear sandals or dress cute because my ankles would show my sweat also Could never get my nails done either ughh Anywho I tried Drysol for the FIRST TIME last night No side effects although my hands and feet feel a little dry this morning am I normally start sweating for no reason as soon as I wake up no sweat just yet Ill update lr Running out of room
6870,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42761,2,I sweat from my armpits real bad not like body odor sweat just seems like pure water No Odor and I go through shirt after shirt When I would go to work I would have to bring or uniform shirts to change into throughout my hour shift And then I would think about it all day just was a overall pain I sweat so much it would drain my energy I tried my prescription of Aluminum Chloride DRYSOL and never had a problem again Only problem is it burns like a mother I thought I was suppose to use it every night Big mistake I then was told after after the first few nights you can start using it only once a week Lets just say there is no more sweat and all I need is one shirt for my shift at work Best prescription for sure a out of
6871,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42759,10,Ive always sweat a lot and its super embarrassing I couldnt wear light coloured shirts because Id have giant pit stains and after a few wears the shirts would become stained yellow and were basically ruined It was awful and I was so selfconscious ALL the time Ive tried every brand of extra strength antiperspirants and though some work better than others none worked well enough for me This works wonders for me I dont sweat anymore Something I never thought Id be able to say Drysol has been a total life changer for me and now Im happy to buy clothing again I couldnt recommend this product enough Its wonderful
6872,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,4,42753,7,I get sweaty and I sweat right through that stuff
6873,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,42751,7,Such bad sweatingleaking from armpits that thought I would give it a try No prescrip required in Canada Picked up the extra strength and used three nights in a row Stopped my sweating immed after three nights Last mths before I had to use it again I now add an extra night every couple of weeks and no sweat from pits for over a year Yes it can itch but remember to dab not smear it on More doesnt work any better and almost no itch on my week applications due to using less Short term pain for long term gain
6874,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42737,23,Im and have sweat through the armpits of my shirts since puberty Clinical strengthaluminum chloride products dont work Every time I go clothing shopping I think quotwill this show my sweatquot Finally I told my dermatologist what I had tried already to reduce my underarm sweating and she prescribed Drysol for me THIS STUFF IS AMAZING The first day I wore a tight shirt without sweating through it I almost cried I am using it every night not after showering or shaving with very minimal irritationTo anyone who suffers from hyperhydrosis of the underarms I say this thanks to Drysol I just wore a tight gray longsleeved shirt to a party No sweat marks
6875,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42734,2,I have been battling excessive sweat for a long time in my life I have noticed that many hyperhidrosis treatments have not been working like the should be and have made it very difficult for me say that I found one that actually worked Some worked for a little while then stopped and others only have a little or no effect which is one of the things that I noticed with Certain Dri However with a little research I found out that hyperhidrosis solutions were not all created equal For example Certain Dri has three different types of products which one of them has and in each of deodorant So when I tried the product I used one that was too low in the percentage of aluminum I went with a higher dosage and it works YAY
6877,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42727,13,After reading some other misleading reviews I wanted to write my own I have dealt with hyperhydrosis my entire life and its such a confidence killer I could never dress nicely in high school because Id always hear whispers about my underarm sweat stains I tried certaindry and it worked for about months then stopped I was crushed I finally was prescribed drysol but I wasnt convinced that it would work Ive been using it for about a year now and Im so shocked that it still works I noticed that if you wash your underarms thouroughly and dry them thouroughly the itch isnt as bad as if you were to just apply at the end of the day The only time its ever burned is if I over use it or use it the same day as shaving Worth a try
6878,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42709,9,I suffered with hyperhidrosis for over years I had no idea it was an actual medical condition up until recently I told my doctor about my issue and he prescribed Drysol I must say it changed my lifei cried when I went a whole day without sweating Please ask your doctor about this if you have excessive sweating
6879,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,42709,12,Typical hyperhidrosis story here All of my white undershirts have nasty looking yellowbrown stains on the pits and a lot of colored shirts have white stains from sweating so much that over the counter deodorant had stained the pits Ill admit I didnt have a ton of hope for drysol as no deodorant has ever worked for me This stuff works Im amazed The only problem is that it is excruciatingly itchy I thought this would only be for the first couple of nights but nope Every single night it itches like hell for about minutes Even before I apply it theres a slight itch Occasionally the itching is accompanied by a slight burning sensation but not always The stuff works wonders and Id rate it if it wasnt for the itch
6880,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42704,5,Absolutely amazing I have been suffering from Hyperhidrosis for almost years when a coworker suggested drysol And to my surprise it actually worked I tried all the over the counter deodorants and they never did the trick but this did I use about once a week and have no problems If i do miss a dosage I do notice that the sweating is a little worse but then i just put it on that night and all is good I would HIGHLY recommend this product
6881,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42697,8,This changed my life I read reviews before giving this a try and thought quotwell these people must not sweat as badly as I doquot No these people were all correct This is like a miracle drug I used to be able to stand outside in degree Fahrenheit weather in a tshirt and my armpits would be sweating Now I can actually dress for the weather and not have to worry I can wear long sleeves and my down jacket and NO SWEAT
6882,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,43080,0,Drysol completely changed my life My armpits would sweat so much even in the middle of the winter with just a tshirt on I got in the habit of always wearing a tank top and a thick cardigan over it in the winter time so the thickness of the cardigan could normally hide my sweat unlike a regular long sleeve shirt I didnt know what was wrong with me but someone told me about Drysol so I looked it up I read the reviews that all said quotI seriously didnt think anything could help me but this is a life saverquot etc I thought quotWell their situation must not be as severe as mine Nothing had worked for me and I doubt this willquot Boy was I wrong This stuff is AMAZING It completely changed my life and I highly recommend it
6884,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,43020,4,Ive had hyperhidrosis since middle school It was my armpits They sweat something awful It couldve been degrees outside and I looked like I just ran a mile marathon I was prescribed drysol and didnt read the directions So I just went home and put it on It made my armpits extremely itchy and red also burned So I figured it dosent work It sat on a shelf for years while I struggled with hyperhidrosis Then one day I decided to try it out again and got a new prescription for it I followed the directions and didnt shave before use and put it on before I went to bed Also didnt wear deodorant the following day I stop sweating it was a miracle I was mad at myself that I had the cure sitting right there the whole time
6886,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,3,43004,1,I am a HEAVY underarm sweater So it was no surprise that this medication barely helped reduce my underarm sweat Not to mention the bottle only lasts for less the month a tleast for me I recommend you save your money and stay away from this product if you think your hyperhidrosis is beyond bad
6887,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,43003,3,I have been sweating for a while I love Drysol It has helped me greatly and I am very happy my doctor recommended it There is a downside to it though It can itch and sting if you put it on daily If you want to avoid this Id put it on every other day and dont wear it over the weekend Id ask your doctor about this though It is a great product and Id recommend this to everyone
6888,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42997,1,I must say that I am truly greatful that my doctor prescribed this It changed my life so much that I dont have to be ashamed of the odor caused by sweating under my arms anymore because its gone Ive tried almost every deodorant over the counter there is and nothing worked Because of drysol I now have the confidence to walk around freely wearing clothing other than all cotton and not have sweat marks under my arms I am so thankful for this product and glad I went to the doctor about my problem which led me to discover this product
6889,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,42996,3,I had been sweating from my armpits excessively for years starting when I was about I was always wearing baggy dark clothing and avoiding constant movement so people would see my sweat I am now and my dermatologist recently prescribed this to me I can honestly say that it has changed my life Even in degree weather there is no sweat from my underarms The only down side is the itchingburning however if I use it at night it is usually gone by noon the next day I have learned to use this only times a week and especially not after shaving This product is worth it
6893,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42982,2,This has changed my life I had sweated profusely since nd grade My whole life up until a year ago I was never able to wear the clothes I wanted and I was embarrassed multiple times from sweating so much I was a joke But last spring age I started drysol and my life has changed My only regret is that I didnt get it sooner in life
6894,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42972,10,Im am a year old girl whose been sweating since the th grade Its Soo embarrassing that I used to wear mostly black so no one would see the pit stains Drysol works really great The only downside I would say is that if I use it everyday or after I shave it has the worst burningitching sensation
6895,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42968,0,It only burns when putting on after shaving or in excessive amounts I have been using it for years and only need to apply it about once a month to keep armpits from having an odor I do not ever sweat anymore So glad I bought this product
6897,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42967,2,Ive had to deal with my sweating problems ever since th grade I am now in college and Im happier than ever that I found this product For years I received botox injections to stop my sweating in my armpits However that pain was unimaginable I switched to Drysol and I have never been happier I can wear my shirts now without having to worry Definitely would recommend this product to anyone who feels stuck with no solution to their sweating
6899,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42950,9,I am glad my dermatologist prescribed this for me to use on my armpits Initially I tried using it once a day and it broke me out and I had the itchystinging side effect From thereon I learned to use it about every days and it keeps me dry along with another prescribed topical treatment I also use Drysol for my oily face and it works It calms my oily glands and it produces less oil especially on my nose If you use Drysol on your face test it on a small area of your face with a cottonball I dont use it everyday on my face I only use it once a week on my face and every other day on my nose My results were minimal oil production on my face and no need to blot my face throughout the day
6900,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42937,0,Try this product Follow the directions It worked for me I lived the first yrs of my life quotpitted outquot I used it regularly for about one year Now I still sweat during exertion which I consider normal but I mostly only use deodorant products I used this product when it was only sold thru the pharmacy window Now you can get it on the shelf right next to all the other anti perspirant deodorant products
6902,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,42913,13,I am someone who sweats anytime under my arms it could be for any reason and I would filter my life around it Loose shirts dark colors and I would rarely ever raise my arms for the fear that I would show my stains of sweat Talked to my dermatologist and they offered my Drysol and I absolutely loved that I could wear anything and I wouldnt sweat but it does have its downside to it I am a girl and shaving under my arms irritates the crap out of it and burns I tried to use nair instead of shaving and it burns even more I honestly do not know what to do
6904,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42899,3,Trying for years in the US to find something that worked for my daughter Hers is so bad it really fills the room and now its totally gone We are so grateful
6906,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42858,13,This stuff is absolutey amazing I never could wear anything but black because I sweat so much in my armpits I started using this a couple years ago When I first started it I had to use it once every couple weeks Then only once every months and now its been over a year and I dont have to use it and Im not sweating It felt like it saved my life in a way Im so happy I found it
6907,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,1,42683,1,Effective but it destroy shirts in the arm pit because its too strong so think twice befor you use that stuff
6908,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42683,10,Drysol has seriously changed my life I have excessive sweating on my scalp and face No matter where I went sweat would be pouring down my face like a waterfall The biggest issue I had with the sweating was at work as I was serving food and obviously nobody wants to be served by the sweaty girl Some days I didnt even want to go to class because I my face would be dripping with sweat I was recommended Drysol by a dermatologist but I was told that it would sting a lot but I was willing to try anything Let me warn you that it burns like crazy You will want to wash it off but stay strong it is worth it I applied it on my face for nights and my scalp for nights and I am dry as a bone Drysol has forever changed my life
6909,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42682,4,I just want to say that this product has completely changed my life I used to wake up to sweaty arm pits and I would worry about lifting up my arms all day long every day I would wear jackets to cover up the sweating and try to wear white shirts to try and help Not anymore I am satisfied with its results The only negative effect was just a little tingling and itching but wow was it worth it I no longer have to worry about my arm pits Definitely worth every penny
6910,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,42673,6,I just got diagnosed with hyperhidrosis but have suffered from it since my teen years I am now I never knew there was medicine for this I literally have failed at job interviews due to my excessive sweating on my head and face I stopped wearing makeup lotion and even started taking cold showers to try and decrease sweating but nothing worked so I have been using drysol nights now and I have noticed some decrease but it hasnt completely gone away I just hope the itching stinging burning sensation is worth it
6912,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42651,2,I have suffered from hyperhidrosis in the arm pits for years No deodorants have worked ever I could literally feel sweat dripping out of my arms I was recently prescribed DrySol for the sweating and it works I have gone through weeks of the treatment and have had zero sweating in my pits I would recommend only using the product on the area of your choice only times a week I usually do it before bed maybe every couple of days I havent had any pain or issues The only thing I have had was a slight itch but no pain at all I wouldnt recommend using it daily It is so nice to be able to go out and not have to worry about lifting my arms and having puddles on my shirt Good luck
6913,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42631,4,This is my first ever product review I felt obligated to write this because it is a life changing solutionWas a bit worried when it only reduced my sweating after days of use I didnt think it would work because my sweaty hands were the worst Ive ever seen literally dripping and unconcealable On third night there was horrible itching and pain but I endured it The next day hands were completely dry I now only have to use it once in a while for maintenance This completely changed my life and I am glad to be rid of that dreaded hyperhidrosis PS be sure NOT to use it on any cuts or skin that is already dryTHANK YOU SO MUCH
6914,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,6,42630,4,Ever since middle school I have suffered from hyperhidrosis since I was My problem area was my armpits and I was very self conscious Although this product has helped with the sweating it doesnt always work but ALWAYS causes extreme pain rashes and itching There were times were I would feel like crying because of the pain The product isnt terrible and certainly works but is NOT WORTH THE PAIN
6915,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42611,4,I read the info sheet that was given to me when I got Drysol It said some minor burning and irritation was possible The first night I used it it burned to the point where after an hour I had to wash it off just so I could get to sleep Even then it burned but it wasnt unbearable The next night same thing Im liking the product as it helps but it isnt worth the pain
6916,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42608,12,This is hands down the best thing that has ever happened in my life My problem areas are my hands and feet They would sweat so bad the sweat would appear through my sandals and my hands would stick to my paper when writing in school So embarrassing I used Drysol for consecutive nights and after the rd night I was sweat free I did not experience burning and itching until the third night and boy was it unconformable to sleep in I now only use it once a week but will cut down later on in the year Drysol did make my hands very dry to the point when I rub then together the dead skinflakes would fall off and a lot of it I am in search for a good hand cream but I am in no rush because dry hands are better then sweaty ones
6917,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42607,9,This product is a God send Minor burning sensation after applying and in the morning until I shower but you have to weigh the positives with the negatives I used to be drenched under my arm pits but now I can go a full hr shift without even noticing any sweat
6918,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,6,42602,2,It worked very well for the first weeks with some itching and burning but it was tolerable Now it doesnt burn or do much to prevent sweating I dont sweat as much as I used to but it is still an excessive problem The next step is Botox injections according to my doctor
6919,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,1,42592,3,Can only have this on for literally minutes before the itchingburning makes me want to cry I cant even concentrate on a TV show to take my mind off it Anyone know of an alternative that doesnt cause these effects The catch is that the one time I kept it on half the night I didnt sweat again for monthsShould probably also mention that my sweating problem is my face and neck particularly my forehead
6920,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42583,14,Ive been using this product for only weeks but I strongly recommend it I used it days in a row at first before I got to bed I applied it on my under arms let dry throw on a tshirt and went to bed Like some of you I also expirienced some burningitching sensation first day its was very mild but the third day it was bad but not unbearable After that Im just applying it x a week Its a life changer before I couldnt even wear the tops I wanted its was embarrassing walking around with there huge sweat stains on my underarms But now I can wear what I please theres no need to put up with that anymore
6921,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42580,7,Ive been using it for about a month and Ive been sweat free ever since
6922,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42570,5,I finally talked to my doctor about my uncontrollable armpit sweating and she prescribed me drysol I used to take freezing cold showers dry off and be soaked in minutes But drysol has helped me so much My pits stay dry and I can wear tank tops again without feeling drenched
6926,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42554,11,I have been afflicted with hyperhidrosis for over a decade A pharmacist told me about Drysol I followed the products directions and applied it before bed time for three consecutive nights To test it I ate very spicy food In the past my head would have been drenched but it was totally bone dry Drysol is a God send It is truly a miracle cure I will follow the directions and apply it once or twice a week It really alters and shrinks the sweat glands I cant say enough great things about this fabulous product My life has really changed for the better Thanks from the bottom of my heart Drysol makers
6927,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42554,10,I have been suffering from hyperhydrosis for years My scalp would literally sweat like a broken faucet I would constantly have to wipe the perspiration off my head every few seconds It was so embarrassing A pharmacist recommended Drysol and after the first application I was sweat free I couldnt believe it I have a new lease on life I can finally not have to carry napkins around and be worried about sweating in front of the public If you suffer from severe sweating of the scalp please I repeat please give Drysol a try you wont be sorry I give this product a rating of an eleven out of ten
6928,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,42549,13,Although Drysol does work it is also very painful for me When I apply and even hours after I have pain in my armpits They are completely bumpy with red rashes and the burning is the worst part The morning after I apply it the redness dies down and so does the pain The sweating does go away and this product would be perfect without the horrible side effects it gives me Overall I feel that the product is not worth the pain I go through when and after applying
6929,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42538,10,I have used it for over years and it truly changed my life My Dermatologist told me about it By using it I was able to give a firm handshake and get an excellent job I though I would eventually not need it but am in my s and still depend on it to control my sweaty palms I love it and recommend it whole heartedly
6930,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42531,7,Ive suffered from this condition my whole life When I was younger people would always make comments on my hands After years of begging I was taken to get it checked out Im amazed at the results For the first time that I can remember my hands and feet are dry The problem for me is the soles of my feet are itchy Not just a slight itch no its much worse After a few days it fades As a result of taking this it has caused my skin to peel from its dryness
6931,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42529,23,Ive been using drysol for over years and it has been a blessing to my life Like many of you I suffered from the burning itchy sensation and dryness as a result of the usage of this product I was told by my dermatologist to place the drysol solution on my underarm and once it completely dries to then place hydrocortisone LOTION no prescription required over the counter As far as the dryness in the areas where you expierience dryness ie hands amp feet place the drysol solution once it completely dries place Excipial lotion no prescription required over the areas that are dry This has worked wonders for me and is a MUST try Hope this helps
6932,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42514,6,Ive suffered from hyper hidrosis all my life and its was nearly unbareble and I got to the point where I didnt want to go out because of it and hypercare saved me Easy application and no pain or issues for me although I have noted many other people have had these issues
6933,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42503,18,As a teenager sweating is a huge problem for me wherever and whenever I have tried the antiperisperant deodorant in stores but none have worked for me until my doctor prescribed me this After applying it stings and itches a bit but it is so bearable and worth it No sweat at all the next day and at school I didnt have to hide the wetness under a sweatshirt Would totally reccomend
6934,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42499,14,When I was in middle school I started experiencing hyperhydrosis of the underarms I dont remember how I first came across Drysol but it made such a huge difference in my life I could wear ANY SHIRT I wanted It definitely caused some itchingstinging of the underarm area if I applied it within hours of shaving so follow the directions The day after the first use my underarms were sweat free I used it for three consecutive nights and after that I only needed to reapply once a week and eventually once a month and so on Today I havent used it in at least years but I still dont have any underarm sweat It basically deleted my axillary sweat glands Hallelujah
6936,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42491,10,plantars warts for son so bad and deep one podiatrist wouldnt treat him Referred to another Laser surgery is only option to keep normal life but told to use Drysol for weeks first Off script as directed put on each am once a day only Wow After hrs they started to turn black and discomfort gone After wks they are more dry and black we are waiting to hear back from podiatrist to see next step Surgery may not be needed after all No side effects
6937,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,5,42489,3,The pain this causes is excruciating Ive had to get up several times during the night to wash it off due to the burning and itching it causes Its so painful I cant sleep and end up tearing up washing it off It works for a couple days and then youre back to suffering through a painful sleepless night The pain isnt worth it
6940,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42474,16,I dont even know where to start with drysol but it has saved my life amp my confidence Goodbye to constant underarm wetness
6941,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42470,4,Living I Phoenix I rarely wear blouses with sleeves most days it is a tank top with a jacket thrown over for the office So sweating in the pits is not an option unless I get my jackets dry cleaned after every use I have been using Certain Dri rollon after trying various other clinical strength antiperspirants for a few years now While it has always itched when I apply the rollon version at bed time the solid version does not but I noticed some dampness in my pits with the solid So i am sticking to rollon worth the mild itching for completely dry pits
6945,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42457,13,This product is flat out amazing As a teen I was always conscious about my sweaty hands Rejecting people whenever they reached out for a handshake was more than embarrassing but I still did it and people would always comment But when I found Drysol I didnt think it would work for me and ignored all of the ratings I gave it a shot though and it WORKED within the next day I applied it I experienced no irritation on my hands but it may be different for other people This thing does what it says it does and BELIEVE ME With consistent use within the first few days your hands will be bone dry and you begin to realize that you need to apply it less and less Thanks to Drysol Im literally reborn and anxietyfree
6947,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,42445,13,This works amazingly Ive had a problem with sweating for so long and this was a life saver for me However if you get it prescribed by a doctor I recommend that you test how often you put it on yourself I recently had Hypercare which according to my pharmacist had the same exact ingredients as Drysol so my doctor told me how much to put on a week etc But a horrible burning and redness happened in my armpit and a lump came about from using it too often So seriously use this sparingly and test it yourself how often to use it Everyone is different so you may only need to use it a couple times a month or week etc Just a warning for new users
6949,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42434,9,Not discontinued any longer Thank god it was the only product that work for me
6951,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42420,8,Ive been using this product for around months and it is amazing Right around the beginning of th grade I began to sweat profusely under my arms I tried different deodorants and antiperspirants but nothing worked I was at the point where I wouldnt even raise my hand because I was afraid everyone would see My doctor recommended Drysol and it worked after one day I now apply every few days and on the off days I use deodorant that night and Im dry This product is amazing
6952,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42418,8,Such a great product The day after my first use I had no sweat stains at all Usually at around am I would get these huge embarrassing sweat stains Now I had none and it was such a relief If you are experiencing sweating problems please please please use Drysol you will get amazing results
6955,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42410,5,First off this product is a holy grail for people who have hyperhidrosis I purchased the highest strength and its changed my life I feel so much more confident hugging people and dont have to constantly worry about how my armpits smell not to mention cut down on the amount of laundry I have to do For anyone out there whos tried every deodorant and antiperspirant known to man in the hopes of warding off underarms that smell like death Drysol will change your life The reason why I gave it a though was because if you dont follow the instructions exactly like it says you will suffer itchy underarms for the WHOLE NIGHT if you apply it the same day you shaved Overall very satisfied with this and highly recommend it
6956,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42408,9,This stuff really does work My right underarm would sweat almost instantly and would leave the biggest stain Since using drysol that has stopped The only downside is how badly it burns It burns and itches so badly when you first apply it but the results are so good that the temporary burn is almost worth it
6957,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42406,2,Ive have trouble with under arm sweat for years which has made me extremely self conscious and ruined many shirts A friend suggested Drysol after having great results so I asked my doctor if I could give it a try My underarm sweat diminished probably after the first use and seems nonexistent now after two applications I use a very small amount dry my underarms with the no heat setting of my blow dryer and go to bed It does itch for about minutes but Ill take that side effect any day over sweating Thankfully I havent had any issues with my arms burning If youre looking for relief from underarm sweat I definitely recommend this medication So far it has been a life changer
6958,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42388,6,Doctor recommended this No prescrip needed in Canada Excessive sweating in armpits Used evenings at bedtime Itchy during application but not insane I Immedediately quit sweating Lasted about months before needing to reapply Use once every weeks and keeps sweat away I love it
6959,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42373,6,Drysol works great By me being a teen I usually dont apply every night but it still works effectively Ive been on and off the medication because the burning sensation is very uncomfortable Other than the burning sensation the product works great I barely sweat at all
6960,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,42373,9,I actually just started using this product and in using it right now and my armpits burn so bad I could cry Theyre also itching like crazy But I really dont wanna be a sweat bucket at school So
6962,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42363,16,PLEASE READAre you afraid of shaking peoples hands Do pencils slip from your grip Have sweaty hands during the dead of Winter Afraid of handling loose change Do you WANT a changeLOOK NO FURTHER THAN DRYSOLIve had all the above problems and MORE for so many years Ive been embarrassed and socially anxious because of hyperhydrosis Finally I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist recommend Drysol I had never heard of it before but what more could I lose My actual handsI tried it every night for days now and it keeps getting better and better We went to Church today Christmas and during the peace offering my hands were completely DRY I owe my life to this product God bless them I recommend it to everyone
6963,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42360,7,I have been struggling with excessive underarm sweat since I hit puberty I had tried literally everything and nothing even slightly helped One day I was at the drug store and spotted drysol I was a bit reluctant by the price but my desperation decided to give it a shot Just after a few nights of using the product I saw results Using drysol has literally been the best decision of my life I am no longer anxious and embarrassed about my underarms and can wear anything Id like Although it did make it hard to sleep at night due to the itchiness and slight burning but I say its totally worth it and eventually I got used to it and it wasnt so bad Definitely recommend
6964,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42341,11,There is good and bad about the product I have an excessive sweating problem and cannot wear tight shirts due to pit stains This product prevents me from sweating I have had no sweat stains But it creates a burning pinching itchy feeling when you put it on It is very uncomfortable to fall asleep with
6965,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42332,5,This works great it absolutely gives the desired effects NO MORE SWEATING you can apply it to other areas as well if you so chose Really does work Post two hour gym session rinse off in the shower No deodorant applied Still no sweating But it does have a burning effect which can be quite uncomfortable But a little bit of some burn cream of any sort id imagine and that goes away Its best Applied at night and then rinsed off in the morning You will love it
6966,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42328,0,I had moderate to severe underarm perspiration throughout my late teens and twenties It was embarrassing and uncomfortable I then did some internet research and came across this I applied three evenings in succession then once every couple of days then every week for about two months After about six months I only needed to use it every month to two months or so Ten years on I cant imagine having sweaty armpitsHowever I would say that the first couple of months were a little uncomfortable because of the itchiness during the night However it was worth bearing with and apparently using some talcum powder prior to applying can help
6968,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42314,3,I was skeptical but after nights of using this Im almost dry
6969,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42314,4,This product works but it may take some practice to apply it most effectively Ive had painful burns from using it too often or during the day it may be the movement that exacerbates the burningBuy a jar of cheap baby bum zinc creamApply the zinc in a circle around the part of the armpit where the hair grows leaving the center clean and clearCarefully dab Drysol only on the center area preferably before bedtime and put on a t shirt that is black or grey zinc cream stainsI do this several times a week Ive tried just dabbing the center of my armpit without the zinc but the burn still occurs AROUND that center spot but not inside it even though I around apply Drysol there The cream also works to sootheheal burns
6970,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,2,42313,3,I sweat excessively and I thought drysol was my only option left and when I used it first I didnt sweat at all but then I had an allergic reaction to it and needed to stop immediately Now Im a bag of sweat Great
6972,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42306,2,Great product I have excessive sweating and it really worked for me
6974,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42290,4,I have been using Drysol for years I have figured out the perfect process for using the product If you arent careful you can apply Drysol in such a way that it will cause extreme burning sensations and rashes Heres how to apply it properly Men carefully shave the center portion of your armpits to expose the bare skin If you look closely youll be able to see the sweat gland areas of your armpits Apply the product only to this area and not to the surrounding skin Do this right before bed and sleep all night long with it on your armpits should keep you dry for to weeks Do this multiple nights in a row for a longer affect My dad totally cured his hyperhydrosis by doing this every Night for two weeks
6977,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,1,42266,2,I was prescribed this by my doctor to deal with my excessive sweating under armpits After using it for a couple of times I started experiencing itchy reddish rashes under my arms The rash didnt stop no matter how much I tried to heal it I went to see my doctor and she said it was an allergic reaction to the Hypercare and advised me to stop using it She said I had dermatitis which was the result of using Hypercare and prescribed me a cream to cure the rash
6978,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42266,11,This product has been a life changer I would be so embarrassed to wear anything other than black or white shirts The amount of sweat I would have under my arms was crazy I remember going to my cousins wedding and was wearing a tan suit and you can see the sweat stains on the outside of my suit I tried everything to padded under arm tshirts sweat block certain Dri and nothing worked until this I cant believe that after years of dealing with this problem I am now completely dry The ultimate test for me was my week long vacation this past May in Puerto Rico I only wore tank tops everyday and not one drop of sweat under my armpits This product has changed my life Please give it a try bc it really works
6980,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42262,4,Ive had hyperhidrosis for over years now on my hands feet and underarms It was honestly so frustrating not being able to wear light tshirts and growing completely petrified when someone offered to shake my hand I couldnt even hold my boyfriends hand It was miserable But drysol is magic and has changed my life For me it isnt necessary to apply every night or my skin burns pretty bad and gets a rash So usually I will apply it or times a week and i literally do not sweat one drop on my underarms I completely recommend drysol
6981,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,6,42257,3,I have just applied this once to my underarms works great Only problem is that I experienced burning and itching the first night I applied it havent applied it since and now my underarms are peeling and burn and feel irritated in the morning when I put on a shirt and put my arms down maybe it was because I used to much at first Im not sure and I havent used it since I dont know what I should do has anyone had this experience
6982,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42255,5,I have had underarm sweating issues since I hit puberty sweating a lot only in public or social situations For years Ive worn black shirts or looser cotton tops to conceal the sweating Ive successfully been able to manage but I got tired of it I told my doctor and she prescribed me with this Ive used this for three nights and have noticed that my underarms are completely dry but a tad wet when exercising At night I apply this with a cotton pad the applicator sucks I havent had any negative side effects no pricking or tingling feelings Ive had no issues sleeping For someone who has silently suffered this is a lifechanging product that makes me more confident to be myself To those with the same issue there IS hope

6999,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42150,22,Never in my life have I written a review for anything ive taken yet I felt the need to write this as I suffered the same symptoms as many people that has already reviewed I only wore black t shirts or tanks could never wear color due to sweating like a dog in my armpits for no reason Large visible dark wet spots under my arm for no reason just sitting in class Was pessimistic about Hypercare as many things havent worked in the past but take my word for it this stuff will change your life Take your chance and free yourself of the silent trauma of sweating profusely
7000,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42140,13,Ive always had a problem with my underarms getting soaked for no reason It could be freezing and I would still be wet There was no smell just the wetness As a high school student I always tried to cover it up with dark clothes and baggy shirts Ive been using hyper care for about a week and its amazing Ive been completely dry since the first use However the first two uses made my arms burn really bad They were really sensitive to the touch for the next two days I just applied it again for the rd time this week and it is just a small tingling feeling At first it may burn but if youre like me it was worth it Great product
7003,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,42108,9,I was prescribed Drysol by my dermatologist I was open to try anything because I deal with hyperhidrosis and bromhidrosis You cant use any deodorants with this product so that made me nervous the first application was fine but I was smelly the next day as I couldnt use deodorant Over the course of a few days it started working more and I was sweating a lot less However the cons are that this product is so irritating My skin was raw to the point that when I moved my arms it hurt You have to apply the solution at bedtime and it was to the point that I couldnt fall asleep due to the pain of the irritation And this was after I had stopped doing daily applications and was only applying it every to days overall I wouldnt recommend
7005,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42105,12,I got this product when I was sweating through my uniforms in school almost constantly and was drenched minutes into first period Even in the middle of winter I couldnt wear tight clothes or anything colored I started wearing baggy sweatshirts without shirts yet I could still feel the sweet dripping down my arms and side I finally told my mom who made me an appointment with the dermatologist Although this product itches until you go to sleep it is worth the peace of mind and comfort I am on my third application and I am already completely dry
7006,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42102,19,I have had a chronic problem with hyperhydrosis I am active duty in the navy and I can say this has been challenging at work I have spent hundreds of dollars on Otc brands deodorant and antiperspirant laundry detergent dry cleaning all my uniforms after wearing them once and worse of all having that feeling that people are always looking at my sweat or me just being afraid to raise my arms I have literally been using this for one week and it stops wetness in its tracks Shoot even the water in the shower avoids it like a force field For me it burns like hell but its like a good workout I see it as at least I know its working Worth every burn
7007,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42099,16,Had severe sweating in my armpits beginning when I started to go through puberty my parents and doctor both told me that as I got older this problem would go away It didnt and as a result I started using Drysol I know you probably have seen these two words a lot on this website but the product really is life changingGreat product
7008,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42097,10,Experienced excessive sweating my entire life I wish I would have got treated a long time ago Ive always wore baggy shirts hoodies layers anything To cover it up Now I dont have to anymore I never sweat anymore However The doctor recommended x a week and I got over excessive the first week out of eagerness If used too often or right after shaving its dries them out so bad and can be very painful Used as stated is amazing though Love it
7009,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42090,7,I developed sweaty armpits in high school and just dealt with it for many years by layering tshirts and wearing patterns etc Finally about a year ago I talked to my derm about it and he prescribed Hypercare I was skeptical but took daily applications to start and then sure enough my armpit sweating reduced easily by I was shocked it worked so well I only need to reapply once a week or so Been working like that for over a year I also have sweaty palms but Hypercare didnt help on my palms But I am so grateful for having the armpit issue solved Just be sure your armpits are fully dry when you apply to avoid irritation
7011,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,5,42066,8,I would always be in class with wet armpits I would be doing nothing but sitting and my shirt and armpits would be soaked I never understood why When I first got Hypercare it worked great I didnt need to reapply because it was working Now my sweat is starting to come back and after re applying it no longer works I do not know why but I really wish it would work again
7012,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42063,7,Hyperhidrosis basically has controlled my life for as long as I can remember and I am a senior in high school right now My first memory of excessive sweating goes back to eighth grade right after I took a test and I saw on my bright blue shirt a small but obvious ring of sweat My sweating requires a trigger generally anxiety stress or if I am put on the spot Therefore when I am at home with my family I am completely dry and there is nothing wrong Anyways Ive been wearing baggy stuff and black shirts for the last three years and that works to cover up the sweat but not the smell I finally told my mom she called my doctor and prescribed me to hypercare I wore a white shirt to my practice and zero sweat Life saver
7013,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,42054,21,This product works for hyperhidrosis If you have sweaty hands this will work I been using it for about two years now and thank God it still works But lately for some reason its causing irritation between my fingers but doesnt matter I will endure it as long as it stops my hands from sweating
7014,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42049,8,How often do you find a product that really does what its supposed to Never But this stuff really works I wouldnt say I had severe sweating problems but my underarms were wet constantly I was constantly uncomfortable because of it always felt this nasty wetness and could never wear any shirt more than once Wearing slim fitting tops was out of the question and I cant tell you how many silk blouses Ive ruined after only wear This product worked instantly I applied it overnight and the next day I didnt sweat AT ALL not even a tiny bit I now apply it twice a week and I forgot what sweating is I can wear anything and feel comfortable all day long And its cheap too without insurance cant beat that
7015,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42046,31,Ive been using Drysol for about years and it has changed my life I went from always having to wear black andor jackets all the time to having absolutely no more sweating I followed the directions to a tee but after a year I started to cut back on my use Now I only apply once a month and it works greatTipMake sure you dont shave your armpits for at least a couple of days before applying and that will alleviate any tingling or burning
7016,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42044,13,This was like a miracle prescription Works great no side effects I did learn to never put it on right after shaving my armpits though
7017,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42021,8,I struggled with extreme facial sweating for years and when I say extreme I mean it I used to carry a kleenex or paper towels or even real towels on my purse to dry my face I couldnt apply any product because I sweated like there was no tomorrow I do not live in a warm place Montreal but even extreme cold temperatures did not change anything As soon as it was a little warm like climb in a bus after a min walk by C I sweated and I was soaked Well I have been using Xerac and the day after the first application it was LITERALLY a miracle I went out and I walked more than miles by C and there was a very light amount of sweat around my nose and that was it I recommend this product It changed my life
7019,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,42012,8,This product is unreal I was always sweating for no reason at work under my arms were wet all day and all my undershirts were ruined Then it got worse if I felt like someone was looking at my or I got emberassed my forehead would sweatseriously this product is amazing works like a charm

7022,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41983,18,I have experienced excessive underarm sweating since my teens and have been so annoyed and embarrassed Why didnt I check into this sooner This product is amazing I agree with other reviewers about the burningtingling sensation When I first started using it about a month ago I followed the directions and used it for three consecutive nights It burned I wont lie It kept me from getting a full nights sleep BUT the results were worth it After just one application it worked The next day there was NO wetness I now apply it just once a week and it is still effective for me Plus the burning sensation has never occurred again I do find it necessary to apply deodorant not antiperspirant in the morning
7023,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41975,13,Ive been using this for close to a month At first I started out with using it everyday and increasingly gained confidenceIve experienced hyperhydrosis for about years while in my teens and was afraid to wear anything but black Period After about two weeks I started applying it once every two days now Im down to once every three days Im so excited that I found something that works It does make my underarms itch sometimes but it isnt painful just annoying Im hoping that by the time I move to Arizona in June Ill only need to apply this every month or so But this works wonders
7024,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41962,11,I have been suffering with hyperhidrosis ever since I was in grade I could never wear any other color but black and wearing big sweaters would even be a issue I tried all the shelf clinical brands but nothing seemed to work It went on all these years and when I started college studying vet medicine and had to wear light blue scrubs I knew this would be a issue and something had to be done My doctor recommended this to me and I can honestly say I have never been happier It says on the bottle to apply daily but i find one application works for a few days Totally recommend this
7025,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41961,0,Ive had excessively sweaty hands since puberty probably since around age Its been such an embarrassment my whole life Shaking hands holding hands touching anyones arm face etcalways gave me anxiety worrying about whether my hands were drenched Wiping them on my pants putting tissues in my pockets before I had to shake hands so I could dry them offits insane Im years old now and finally asked my doctor about DrysolI wish I would have found this product YEARS ago It has given me so much more confidence The sweat isnt completely gone my hands still get clammy from time to time but Id say its reduced by at least Amazing
7026,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,41954,13,Around the age of I started noticing how much I was sweating and it wasnt normal I was sweating the most under my arms hands and feet It was so bad Id be embarrassed to Shake someones hand wear sandals and colored shirts Id feel sweat drip under my arms and my hands would leave sweat marks on my deskpapers I told my dermatologist and he recommended Drysol Ive been using it for days and I can genuinely tell you its helped about Im really pleased because my sweating was way worse than most people with hyperhidrosis and nothing else was helping me certain dry Hypercare However some nights when I apply it my underarms are burning and itching but I try to not touch it amp just go to sleep I strongly recommend it

7031,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41887,14,You rarely hear about hyperhidrosis being anywhere but in the arm pits so it took me a long time to discover Drysol as I have suffered with excessive facial neck scalp upper chest and armpit sweating for almost years and its becoming worse the older I get Drysol is a lifesaver as my sweating has gotten so bad I dont want to leave the house most days I have only been using it for days but I have almost stopped sweating altogether It does sting a little when applied but applying it with a tissue has helped reduce the stinging as you use less

7064,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41409,7,I had a sympathectomy on my right side in and ever since I have had excessive sweating on my left side It got so bad I was literally folding paper towels and tucking them under my arm to soak it up My shirts were always wet on the left side After just a couple of nights using Drysol I dont have wet shirts amp no need for paper towels It does burn amp itch little when I first apply it amp I get a kind of bruised feeling in my under arm but nothing major or that I couldnt deal with Huge improvement
7065,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41409,7,I never had a major sweat problem but when it gets hot outside I immediately get a moisture under my arms and my bacteria combined with my mild perspiration makes the most pungent odor This product has stopped that from happening I couldnt go through another summer of dealing with this It beats doing Botox injections or surgically having my sweat glands removed Easy fix
7066,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41404,12,Ive been dealing with Hyperhidrosis since the beginning of high school and it really became an issue when I began college It was always awful feeling embarrassedinsecure especially because it was so out of my control People started to not want to guard me in basketball anymore my exgirlfriend would make me feel like bad saying she wanted a boyfriend who could actually put his arm around her etc etc But finally I stopped wallowing in my own sorrow and talked to a doctor he prescribed Hypercare and it CHANGED my life Dont let your Hyperhidrosis beat you because with Hypercare you can beat it PS The complaints about the itchingburning sensations are completely valid but Im willing to cope when the payoff for a normal life again
7068,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41396,4,This is absolutely amazing After about years of sweating I finally had enough when I would sweat through hoodies with huge stains Non of my friends would say anything about it but my mom who also has it finally called my pediatrician and got a prescription I put it on the first night and it burned alot but its nothing unbearable The next day sweat free Some days I would forget to put it on at night and go through the day with little to no sweat at all Not even sweating through my clothes I still put it on every night just to be safe but it really worksI would recommend getting this product Some people say it doesnt protect against smell but it does for me The only problems is a little itching during the day and a rash
7070,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41391,4,I have been dealing with Hyperhidrosis underarms since middle school and I have tried EVERY SINGLE over the counter product for excessive sweating My doctor prescribed me Hypercare and from first use I LOVE IT I have not broken a sweat since first use I am so relieved
7072,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41380,18,Literally a lifechanging productIve been using it for days and Im already satisfied I tried other products out there but continued to sweat armpits even in the wintertime minutes out the door and the sweat would go through my shirt within about an hour the sweat would go through my entire SUIT Was thinking about getting surgery or botox injections but somehow stumbled upon a site where I saw Drysol reviews and became cautiously optimistic from the customer reviews that this was my solution SO happy to finally get rid of this terrible condition
7074,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41359,9,I have had a problem with underarm sweat for years now My shirts get drenched Its so embarrassing I have tried every over the counter clinical strength and nothing works I even asked my doctor about it and she declined giving me a prescription strength saying that they dont work She wanted to send me to a dermatologist right away for laser treatments or Botox I didnt want to do that So I kept suffering Until last week I did an internet search on sweaty underarms and I found Drysol It arrived this weekend I have used it nights now and I am totally dry It does burn and itch some at night but that is totally fine with me Because I feel like I have a new lease on life Its a life changer for me Drysol Rocks
7076,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41348,9,After suffering over years with excessively wet armpits I asked my doctor what could be done Hypercare was prescribed and it is such a relief What is amazing is that it takes very little to be effective while using too much may increase itching
7080,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41316,9,This product really works My second day using it and I havent sweated yet I would normally have to bath at least twice a day I been dry all day long Yes I am so thankful for Drysol save my life I became so scared to go out and party or have a good time because of my sweating condition Now Im sweat free and happy as ever
7081,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41315,10,This literally changed my life I can now wear colorful shirts without worrying about sweat stains It worked after the first application My doctor said Id experience quotmild itchingquot and I wish she wouldve been more truthful and said quotpractically unbearable itchingquot but the longer I use this medicine the less I itch I dont itch at all anymore when I put it on If I use it daily I get a dry painful rash in my underarms so I use it every other or every days
7085,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41611,16,In first year university I started sweating so much under my arms that I would have to change my undershirt times a day and only wear dark colours so I wouldnt show my sweat stains I tried every deodarant and antiperspirant I could find and nothing worked I went to the doctor and he recommended Drysol no prescription needed I used it for the first night and covered my underarms with lots of it It was itchy and my skin was irritated in the morning with a red rash but I did not sweat again The small amount of pain from the rash was worth it I only have to reapply once every couple of years Amazing
7086,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41599,14,This product has changed my life I can wear whatever I like now and not feel self conscious I am on ADHD medication and that is something that causes excessive sweating research it thoroughly if you do not believe thatI thought that I would have to sacrifice focusing for the problem of sweating No more I do not have the redness and itching side effects The only regret I have is not finding a provider who would prescribe this for me sooner
7087,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41594,3,I had a problem with sweaty armpits since freshman in high school I told my mom about my problem She took me to the doctor When I used it for the first time my armpits was on fire due to not drying them up well Second time I tried was about years later but I used blow dryer after the shower on my armpits then the medication No problem So now Im and tonight Im do it again and Im also using blow dryer to make sure is dry and I dont have to suffer
7089,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,3,41585,7,Well Ive had excessive sweating for years I had gone to my doctor and was prescribed Drysol and within twenty minutes of applying it my skin broke into an extremely painful bumpy rash I followed all the instructions no shaving before putting it on just a thin layer not to rub it in etc Im sure the product works I just have extremely sensitive skin so Ill just need to continue looking for a product or medical procedure that works
7091,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41567,3,Ive been using drysol for my underarm sweating I never had problem with underarm sweating but it is a second effect of a medication so I wanted to give it drysol a shot after trying every single deorodant over the counter It does and sometimes better than others I tried putting overnight but then when I shower in the morning if I dont put it again I will sweat a couple times during the day But putting on after shower helps even that sometimes I sweat on one side or both Ive burned a few times that I cannot even move my arms I wish it comes with an applicator but at least the one I find doesnt have any I put antiallergic cream on the sides around the armpit and that works sometimes to not getting burned sometimes
7092,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,1,41544,22,I read so many good reviews on Drysol so I decided to try it The first night I used it it had a burning sensation but I could handle it The next day I was so happy with the results I had no sweat at all The second time I used it it itched like crazy and I was up all night trying to tolerate it but still no sweat The third time I used it my armpits burnt and there was red bumps I immediately washed it off but the pain didnt go away Maybe it was just my skin having a reaction to it but I do not think this is for me
7093,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41542,13,Im so happy with Drysol About a year ago I used to sweat constantly under my armpits no matter what I did My problem would only become worse when I would go out in public Id be so afraid to lift my arms lest I show off my sweat that I would only sweat more I developed anxiety of going out even around friends My confidence plunged Ive only been using Drysol for a short amount of time but I can already see huge improvements My confidence is beginning to return but I still catch myself feeling under my arms to see if there is any dampness Nevertheless Im still dry would recommend
7094,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41541,18,Sounds very dramatic but it has literally changed my life No more sweaty palms Its definitely caused my armpits to sweat less but it hasnt completely stopped that yet Be aware that you have to apply it every single night at least at first and it causes itching and redness and if you use it on your hands they will be very dry However its a very small price to pay because it really does stop sweating For me it took about weeks before my hands completely stopped sweating but there was noticeable difference the next day Worth every penny
7095,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41532,16,I have had sweaty armpits for years Tried the napkin trick black tops not lifting my arms avoiding people various deodorants and not shaving Wasnt living freely This stuff works Doctor prescribed it I would pay per bottle if thats what it took to get it Dont get excited when you put it on thinking the more you put on the less you will sweat This will cause severe itching A little bit goes a long way The next morning no sweat This product has given me my social life back Love it
7097,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41520,20,If you dont want it to itch DO NOT overlap the Drysol liquid Make a path to cover your armpit like the old snake game on your cellphone and I havent had my armpits itch in over a year I had sweaty armpits all through high school and I was very self conscious that people were seeing it every time I moved my arms so I would usually wear a sweatshirt I started college and I didnt want this to run my life I went to the doctors and the doctor told me I had Hyperhidrosis and prescribed Drysol for me Its been AMAZING I put it on every days and I havent sweated in my armpits since I use normal deodorant without antiperspirant and it works perfectly
7099,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41502,15,This is the best solution to underarm sweating I did experience one problem a little burning under my left arm After I washed the Drysol off of my left arm and applied some irritation ointment and then the Drysol everything was great I have been dry all day today and I have only used Drysol for night Im so loving this I cant wait to go to Miami I can wear any shirt or blouse I want Im so hyped I give this medication a thumbs up
7100,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41502,9,This product is fantastic The only downside is the itchiness that many including myself have experienced In my experience using too much at one time or over a few consecutive days made the itchiness worse Light use as instructed eliminates most of the itchiness and the product is still effective
7101,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41502,18,I have had this issue for several years I am I would get dressed and have to change before I left the house because I would be soaked through in a few minutes My clothes were stained I couldnt wear light color clothes and always wore a sweater or jacket to hide the wetness I tried every clinical strength over the counter product on the market to no avail I finally asked my doctor and she wrote me a prescription for Drysol It worked after the first application I couldnt believe I suffered all that time My insurance covers it but it is cheaper than my copay It literally changed my life I now wear cotton blouses with confidence No side effects Just dont use it after shaving
7103,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41474,13,A real life changer Ive had hyperhidrosis since high school now and I was always hiding in dark clothes to hide the stains It does burn and itch when I put it on but Id take that over the excessive sweating anyway Pros definitely outweigh the cons
7104,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41453,9,This has done amazing things for me Ive been using it for four days now and its already helping when it says that full effects wouldnt take place until a week Im just giving you a heads up that it burns REALLY BAD Im burning right now actually I think its completely worth it though I recommend this
7106,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,41426,12,This product is absolutely amazing I have only been using it for a few weeks but it is great I honestly used to always wear black shirts and the same black jacket because I would sweat over nothing and being active like walking and physical education made it worst I finally had a doctors appointment and told her about my problem and expected her to say that I would have to get surgery or something but instead she prescribed me this At first I thought I was hopeless and nothing could help but I was wrong It is a MAJOR self esteem and confidence boost now that I can wear whatever I want There is just one big problem with this product I dont know if it happens to other people but it has given me a major rash and its very hard not to itch
7107,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41311,6,This is a miracle product I used to sweat through everything work shirts Tshirts sweaters you name it I would have to take breaks throughout my day to dry my pits I heard Drysol was good and it didnt disappoint I can now wear whatever I want whenever I want with only one application per week Furthermore it doesnt really itch or burn unless you massively over apply it If you sweat a lot just get it dealt with with this
7108,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41311,15,I cannot relate how much this product has changed my life Im yrs old and for years have been embarrassed and frustrated with my underarm sweat like a fountain nothing less All my clothes especially my sweaters were ruined with sweaty odors Countless hours laundering in vinegar and baking soda Thought I would have to live with this for the rest of my days you cant even smell your own perfume all you smell is your sweat and last weeks sweat trapped in your freshly washed clothes I found DRYSOL after googling my hyperhidrosis and after two application Im blown away at how good life is with dry armpits IM CURED Thanks so much DRYSOL this is wonder product Im so grateful to the makers
7109,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41310,10,This product changed my life It works No doubt I had suffered from excessive sweating on my armpits since I was I thought I was cursed and would have to deal with this my entire life It really had a huge impact on my life because I was always limited on the shirts I had to wear I could only wear lose black or white shirts If not I had to wear a black cardigan over everything I wore Yes thats how bad it was until I got prescribed Hypercare when I commented it on a doctors appointment This had really changed my life This product worked the very next day I was truly amazed THANK YOU HYPERCARE Ps Dont use this product when you have recently shaved or else it will burn and you wont be able to sleep all night
7110,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,41304,11,I am so thankful for Hypercare It has changed my life I was dealing with the sweating from th grade I am now a freshman I finally told my mom why I would not wear cute clothes It helped right away Now I dont stay up at night sobbing But I have no clue how to stop the burning because it is almost unbearable But I will stick with because I am tired of being bullied for it
7112,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41253,9,I am a sixteen year old girl and have had a problem sweating since middle school My wardrobe consisted of hooded sweatshirts and black tshirts I was so embarrassed Every day at school I would sweat through all my clothes and finally my boyfriend even commented on it I finally went to the doctor and she gave me Hypercare I used it for the first time last night It itched a little but otherwise didnt bother me Today no sweat Its like a miracle I talked to lots of people and raised my hand in class It was amazing I kept absentmindedly touching the armpits of my shirt to check for sweat but there wasnt any at all This has literally changed my life
7113,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41252,5,Armpits would sweat profusely I would stuff paper towels under my armpits and they would come out drenched I used Hypercare for the first time The sweating completely stopped However I broke out in a bad rash under my armpits the first time I applied it I noticed that my armpits were completely dry within the first week but the sweating became worse on my hands and feet I plan on using it for my hands as well
7115,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41225,5,I used to sweat under the arms excessively All my tee shirts had yellow stains My doctor prescribed this once back in Yes it burned somewhat but it totally stopped the underarm perspiration I havent sweated under my arms much since about the end of I had the prescription renewed in June and that bottle is still half full since I have totally stopped underarm perspiration and I havent had to use it in years
7117,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41209,8,Since I was I am almost now I have had a terrible problem with armpit sweat I went years just dealing getting rid of my cute shirts for black shirts instead and wearing jackets even in the Florida heat I never bothered to ask my doctor about it It never occurred to me that anything but surgery or botox was an optionI tried clinical deodorant after clinical deodorant and while one might work for a day or so I would inevitably begin sweating again within the third application or soThis is my second day using Hypercare and although it tends to BURN after applying within an hour or so it goes away and I was left feeling completely dry up to my next applicationThis is such a huge boost to my self esteem
7118,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41204,3,As far as I can remember I suffered from excessive sweating I always had to sacrifice nice shirts for ones made from fabric the sweating wouldnt leave too much mark Or on which wetness doesnt show But well even changing around times a day wasnt helping Tried everything until someone told me about Drysol I have to say I started using it last night and after being up for hours now Im still wearing the same shirt Ok sweating starts to show but after only one use I have this result Wow Simply amazing I wear a uniform at work and I was desperate to find a way to hide my excessive sweating I think I wont have to worry about this anymore very soon
7119,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41202,6,As a chronic sweater for over years the experience I had last week would probably best bring home how well this product works after chaperoning my daughters school Halloween party I was actually able to put the tightfitting cotton shirt I wore back in the closet for another day No Sweat no odor no nothing THAT would never have been possible preDrysol After one week of use only applied three times I still feel under my arms now and then expecting the wetness to have returned but Im still as dry as the Sahara under there
7121,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41174,5,My armpit sweat was absolutely disrespectful I would sweat for absolutely no reason laying in bed talking to friends walking living breathing It was a nightmare I finally decided that enough is enough there must be something out there besides antiperspirant My doctor prescribed Hypercare and it has compelled me to share my experience The first application did tingle but I was pretty hammered so I didnt mind Next day was absolutely amazing I purposely wore a bright pink shirt all real sweaters nightmare constantly wiping fanning your shirt trying to dry the wet stains and I didnt sweat one bit Great product definitely changed my life
7123,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41146,1,Have sweaty underarms for yrs Then when I hit my s my back and chest started to sweat just as bad If the temp got to degrees my shirts were soakedI got Hypercare now I put it in a pump bottle spray it on and wrap myself in saran wrap for at least hrs once a month I noticed the longer I stay wrapped the better it works MAGIC
7124,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41144,8,I seriously recommend this product to anyone who is looking to treat their excessive sweating condition I used to have a serious problem with my hands they would sweat to a point where they would almost dripped Hypercare has helped me so much and is pretty cheap It took about weeks for me to start seeing the effects trust me follow through applying this on every night for at least weeks before stopping I almost stopped within the first because I thought it wasnt going to work on me I didnt give up hope though and continued Soon enough I began to see miraculous changes my hands would sweat less and less everyday to the point where they are now always dry If your skins starts to peel its normal just dont peel it off I recommend
7125,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41143,3,Since I can remember my underarms have been sweaty and smelly Ive used all types of deodorants without success One night I sat in front of the computer and googled quotsweaty underarmsquot and Drysol product came up I read about and decided to get it For the first time in years I was able to put on my uniform without wearing an under shirt It has been weeks and I still havent worn a Tshirt under my uniforms I am able to walk past people without worrying about if they can smell me Drysol is the best product ever created Thanks Drysol
7127,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41114,3,I am years old and I have had a sweating problem under my arms since I was I have been wearing black Tshirts since I can remember only because they didnt show sweat I went to my doctor about a month ago and she prescribed me Hypercare I love it I could feel the difference just after one use It really is a miracle Yes it itches and sometimes burns when you put it on but it is totally worth it and many people say that I would start sweating a lot in other places but I havent noticed that anywhere so I am super happy with Hypercare
7128,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41108,2,I love this medication I have been so ashamed to go out and be around any one scared that someone would notice the stains on my shirt from the sweat I have been using Drysol for about months now and I cant explain how happy I am to be in my own skin just being around people made me feel like an outsider Not only did my armpit stop sweating the medication has made my body stop sweating as well Good by night sweats I am ready and able to be using this for the rest of my life Thank you so much Drysol Life saver
7129,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41095,2,Hi im a fifteen year old girl and im going to be a junior once the summer vacation ends Ive had axillary hyperhidrosis since maybe sixth grade I never really became self conscious about it until maybe eight grade I always wore sweatshirts no matter what or a baggy t shirt My hyperhidrosis wasnt as bad as others where theyd be drenched in sweat I just always had a maybe one point five by one point five inch sweat mark and its just uncomfortable The night before last night I started using hyper care solution and the following day yesterday I had absolutely no sweating The only problem is that Hypercare is really itchy and irritates my skin But it doesnt burn I recommend this product It works like magic Changed my life
7131,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41085,26,Drysol worked perfectly Im not sure why my hands sweated so much perhaps they were sweaty cause I have really bad anxiety Either way Drysol stopped it Now I dont have to worry about if my hands are sweaty when I need to shake someones hand or avoid even shaking it Drysol is amazing and has changed my life
7132,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40968,1,Great product that works I have used so many products that do not work
7135,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40940,16,The development of medicine has finally reached its peak Ive had a bad issue with sweating from the foreheadface for several years and didnt think there would be a simple solution Having a job where Im involved in many meetings the least bit of nervousness or anxiety and the sweat would just start pouring out at a faster rate making it very embarassing in the work environment Ive only had this product for week but after one use I have not had one drop of sweat come off my forehead Needless to say it has almost given me a renewed sense of confidence Worth its weight in gold

7139,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40920,7,Absolutly amazing I use it every night before bed and in the morning I go to school then work without having to reapply it or any other antiperspirants It works like a charm I highly recommend It may sting a little the first few times but it is definitely worth it Ive tried everything possible to stop from sweating but nothing worked until I tried this
7140,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40916,1,I love this product I have been sweating for years now and was too embarrassed to mention it to my doctor but finally after ruining all of my closed I asked her what to do It works so great but I get the itching burning that other people have said Thats my only problem with the product but it is worth it

7156,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40796,3,I can be locked in a freezer and still be soaking wet with sweat If I must go outside the home I carry a damp hand towel and a big bottle of frozen ice cold water with a plastic fan that will cool me down But then everyone stares at me I dread the days that I must go outside the home I am a prisoner in my own home Cancelling important doctor appointments going without food I mean every word I am saying I call tell this story over and over but nobody really knows or cares they dont walk in my shoes I also live with CHRONIC lower back pain for years
7157,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41085,3,This is the first day where I actually used this product and it works absolutely wonderfully My armpits havent sweated at all which makes me really joyful and I just tried it on my sweaty feet and that stopped sweating also and Im going to try it on my sweaty hands later but Im sure its going to work This product is amazing
7160,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41064,2,I am speechless I have struggled with sweaty armpits for years My sweat has ruined so many of my shirts over the years that I simply throw them away once the sweaty smell is unbearable While in the military it was so bad I would actually cut holes in my military uniform in the under arm area so that I could get cool air in hopes to eliminate heavy sweat I could go on and on Today is my first day and I know this product works because by now I would have my desk fan pointing directly at my underarms to keep me dry and cool to prevent sweating Im am so happy now This solution I know will change my personal and professional life so much No more fear of getting too close to people now This may turn an introvert to an extrovert
7162,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41040,0,I have been using this for a few months now Hypercare has changed my life That is no exaggeration As many of you out there probably know sweating issues can seriously affect your quality of life No more ruined shirts No fear of lifting my arms No longer have to layer an uncomfortably wet undershirt underneath only to have to change it out halfway throughout the day So much more confidence in simple day to day activities and a confidence boost for things that really matter such as interviews or dates The beautiful thing about this product is that after the first week or two you dont have to apply it every night Now I apply it times a week and that works great I have no itching or irritation but those results can vary
7163,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41032,5,This product does work I used to sweat so bad it was not fun I would never wear a white shirt because it would stain it even my black shirts would get ruined because of deodorant so I started buying bigger shirts so that they wouldnt touch my armpits I could be freezing cold and still have sweat marks So a friend of mine told me to try this product I put it off for a few months then I just had enough saw it in the drug store and said why not lets give this a shot I noticed a difference after night but did it for The only complaint that I have with this product is how much it stings and burns I try to make sure I dont shave my armpits the day I want to I put it on and I try to make them as clean and dry as possible Its totally worth it
7166,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,41022,1,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I have suffered from profuse underarm sweating for over ten years and have tried EVERYTHING Paper towels over the counter clinical strength products powder only wearing white and black I didnt want to buy expensive shirts because I knew they would be ruined soon I have only been using this for evenings with one night off to shave and I am about to go to class in a GREEN SHIRT Normally I would have already started sweating but I am dry dry dry I can hardly contain my excitement Very very mild itching for ten minutes after application but nothing unbearable I had worse itching with Dry Idea I would recommend this to everyone
7170,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,5,41009,1,Hurts way too much to continue using this product Ive taken weeks break and still is unbearable Wish it would have worked for me Using Sweat block now doesnt work as well but there is no pain involved
7171,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41006,6,Drysol is great I been reading for those who said it did not work at all this is a product you dont use one night and hope the next day you dont sweat You must use it for days in a row at first Then you can go down to once a week I just use mild but there is extra strength now if mild did not work then maybe try extra strength I still get a tiny bit of odor but I just put on body powder or dab slightly deodorant But its so nice to wear a light colored top or a dry clean only fabric and no sweat shows I can now raise my arms without shame Fantastic
7172,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,41000,2,Amazing after use problem had resolved completely
7174,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40996,3,I have been suffering in silence with my foot odor my entire adult life I have been stared at and talked about behind closed doors and lost many job due to my excessive foot sweating and odor WITH MY SHOES ON I started using Hypercare at night wrapping my feet in plastic with socks and I have not had a day of foot odor since I recently started a new job and Im so happy that I dont offend anyone with foot odor anymore
7175,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40990,2,I have been using this for days on my face to treat excessive sweating I experienced extreme burning and itching One thing that has worked for it is baking soda I pour some in a cup and mix it with a little water until it is the consistency of icing After I put it on I dont experience any more burning or itching Then when it dries I take it off Good luck and I hope this helped
7176,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40988,7,I had hyperhidrosis since like forever and it was really bad I remember when I was in elementary school when my friends played hand games and I couldnt because I know that my palms would sweat and theyll be disgusted by it and when I was going through puberty my under arms started to sweat and it was really embrassing I wore layers of clothes to hide the sweat but thatll just make it worse and also shaking hands was a problem BUT Hypercare helps a lot My life became so much more happier and Im glad that my doctor prescribed me Hypercare and I recommend it to anyone who suffers from hyperhidrosis
7177,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,2,40981,2,It worked for the first hour maybe then I sweated right through it Not sure if I have a stronger case or this just didnt work It also gave me terrible irritation in the applied area for a few hours after taking it off
7178,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40980,2,Ive been using Hypercare for a little over a year and it works great if I use it every night Unfortunately it does sting a lot Ive found that using Ultrabalm from Lush Cosmetics definitely brings down the stinging quite a bit so Id recommend that to anybody who has the same problem
7179,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,3,40979,7,I have palmar hyperhidrosis When I used this it didnt work for me at all My sweat literally sweated off the medication I used every night all summer long and got no results Ive been struggling for at least years
7180,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40977,12,Perfect I saw results in the first use I am not exaggerating Within days I could wear tight grey Tshirts with NO marks I never even imagined that would be possible It had gotten to the point where I could only wear white or black Tshirts I can now wear whatever I want It is a dabber that you dab on your armpits at night then wash off in the morning It is a little uncomfortable at first but if you truly sweat as much as I did you will know that minutes of discomfort at night is worth being able to finally take off that sweater covering your marks and not being embarrassed and holding back for the whole day In fact Drysol is so strong I have had to cut back to using it every other day You will be amazed with your results
7181,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40968,1,I am years old and I have always had sweating issues in conditions that did not call for it Recently it has gotten very bad Cant make it through a workday of retail without a inch diameter sweat stain I have had a series of interviews for an internship and the combination of nervousness and hyperhidrosis catastrophic amounts of sweat and pit stains This is what really motivated me to seek help Tried it last night didnt notice much irritation at all Used a tiny amount and My doctor also recommended putting on a thin layer of moisturizing girl deodorant to help with irritation Today I am sweat free so far I will update after a few days
7182,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40795,0,I have systemic hyperhidrosis This is great for my underarms and works well but can really irritate my skin especially if I have shaved in the last few days I wish I could use this for the rest of my hyperhidrosis because it works better than the systemic medications and no weird side effects but obviously that just isnt practical
7185,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40790,3,Drysol is amazing I am years old and Ive been sweating since I was in th grade I used Drysol for three days and it works great on my underarm the first night but it did not work on my hands at all I think I just have to use it more Thank you Drysol you are a life saver
7186,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40785,8,Okay so I want to marry who ever made this product Im only years old and Ive suffered from extremely sweaty hands since I was around the age of like I heard online about drysol so I asked my doctor about it Ive only been using for about a week now but I love it After the first night of using it it didnt really work too well but the second the only time my hands would sweat was during sports So yeah Im like in love with this product
7188,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,40776,2,I started noticing my sweat in th grade In middle school my doctor said my Sympathetic nerves were hyperactive so I would constantly sweat no matter what temperature Hypercare changed my life because I am a setter on the volleyball team which wouldnt be possible without its use T
7189,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40771,3,The reason I havent rated this product a full is because Im still in the trial stage But Ive used this product for days now doctor recommended me to use it every night for a week and then times a week afterwards And by the third day I saw the difference The past days Ive worn light colors for the first time in years because I didnt have to worry about the sweating It is definitely the best medicine Ive tried and Ive tried many things I hope I dont jinx it but its definitely made degree difference for me Also Ive been shaving at the normal amount few times a wk and putting on my normal deodorant in the mornings and then right before bed I just apply the DrySol under my arm
7191,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40765,7,By far THE single biggest boost to my selfesteem Ever
7193,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40753,0,I am years old and have been sweating like crazy since I started middle school I always had to wear jackets and loose fitting shirts to hide my sweat stains I was embarrassed to tell my mom but I had enough I talked to my mom about it and she told me that I should mention it to my doctor on the next visit Which was luckily the next day My doctor gave me Hypercare I am on day and it has helped a lot The little quotdabometerquot that came with it doesnt work so I have to dab my finger in it and apply it to my underarms The first day it burned a little and stung but nothing too much But on the rd day It was hard to fall asleep it was so itchy I couldnt take it but I managed Hypercare so far has done wonders for me
7194,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40738,1,Changed my life Im almost years old and my life would have been so different if i had known about Hypercare growing up
7197,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40717,9,This product in my humble opinion ranks up there with the wheel as one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of mankind After trying every conceivable quotextrastrengthquot deodorant I figured I was completely hopeless as I had the uncanny ability to sweat through any number of layers of clothes even hoodies It burned like crazy when I applied it and didnt expect much payoff for my pain but lo and behold it works I went on vacation to the tropics swam in the ocean every day and played rigorous sports for two solid weeks without reapplying it once Truly unbelievable and truly miraculous
7198,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40717,1,I have been sweating since I was about I am now and I went to the doctor days ago She prescribed me Hypercare and so far this product has changed my life After my first night my sweating was significantly decreased though still present but each day after I use it it works better and better Today I thought for sure I was sweating I felt like I was and it was outside and nope not a drop of sweat Even on a clingy colored shirt I wish I had tried this years ago I have wasted half my high school experience wearing only black jackets and never raising my hand I cant wait to start school in the fall now being worry free It burns and itches BAD but its worth it
7200,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40711,28,I just want to share this because I didnt see it on any other post Ive been using Drysol for over two weeks now on my forehead and scalp yeah weird place to sweat I know and it has been awesome Before this I would always get salty sweat into my eyes while playing sports or dancing that time has gone Thanks Drysol
7201,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40702,1,This product is amazing Ive only used it twice so far under my armpits and I have not sweated at all I would definitely recommend Now I feel so at peace when I go about my day I dont have to worry about sweating or smelling So grateful that I found this
7202,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40693,2,Im giving it an now because Ive been only on it for less than a week but so far its awesome Ive had this problem of excessive sweating for less than years it seemed to accelerate when I hit Plus I have a pretty stressful job and I have to give a lot of presentations I would only wear black on those days but I love bright colors so on the rare days I did wear red or yellow I would always get a lot of compliments Little did people know I would be stuffing toilet paper or paper towels under my arms I told my dermatologist and he prescribed Drysol So far its working wonders I visited Georgia for a few days and it was hot and humid but I wasnt sweating
7203,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40691,2,Im years old and I have had an extreme sweating problem in my armpits for several years Ive tried pretty much everything Dove Degree Mitchum etc and still continued to sweat I can say that Hypercare is amazing and it works I can now wear cute shirts without having to worry about arm pit stains Thank You Hypercare
7205,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40688,1,Im years old and Im wish I had found this sooner I remember going to the Prom and being so embarrassed because I was sweating so much I didnt want to lift my arms up to dance Ive only used it for days every other day and I just cant believe it I put it on the first night a little burning but it wasnt that bad The next morning I was so scared to go anywhere without a regular deodorant but I couldnt believe I didnt sweat the whole day It really works Ive been stuck trying tons of regular deodorants over the years and nothing has worked Im dry and smell good now
7207,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40680,2,I have had extreme sweating in my armpits for my whole life it really started in middle school but once I got to high school I decided that enough was enough and there must be some kind of medicine to fix this horrible problem I told my doctor about it and she prescribed Hypercare and now I couldnt be happier This product has completely changed my life I highly recommend it
7209,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40679,5,Ive been using Drysol recently and it works fantastic I noticed that I would sweat a lot before I started using the product and I was really embarrassed Now I put on Drysol every other day during the week and then not at all on the weekends It works SO well The first time stings a lot and it may prevent you from continuing usage but dont give up Soon you wont feel a thing when you apply it Then only thing I dont like about it is that the skin in my armpits is darker and I dont like the way it looks but its worth it if it means no sweating
7210,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40679,4,Ive been using this product for less than a week and it has worked miracles Ive had a sweat problem everyday for the past years I found this product and I can honestly say my life has changed
7212,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40665,3,I just tried this product on yesterday right before I went to bed and it did sting a little but nothing really and what can I sayIt really worked way better then secret clinical strength
7213,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40661,2,It really works I feel much more confident in myself I dont have to wear a dark colored jacket all the time or limit my shirts to only tank tops Im SWEAT FREE I cant wait to go shop for long sleeve and short sleeve shirts in any color I desire
7214,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,40655,1,Im and Ive had severe sweating problems since I was in th grade Im writing this as I sit here on my third consecutive night of applying the product I can say that since Ive started using it Ive had minimal sweating during the day Definitely not enough to leave the dark sweat circles anymore I can say goodbye to sweat shirts in summer However for the first few hours after applying the product to my underarms each night I get the worst pinsandneedlesitchingandburning feeling Ive ever felt in my life Its so painful that it actually causes me to sweat for an hour or so after applying it and I find it absolutely impossible to sleep Ill be heading back to the doctor to see if she can give me anything to relieve it
7215,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40648,3,Ever since I was my sweating under my arms has been horrendous and when my first prom came around and I had the most gorgeous dress I decided it was enough Went to the doctor and got DrySol I love it and I can now wear whatever I want when I want including my grey Tshirts
7216,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40647,1,Had very embarrassing sweating problems for the past years and have tried everything from quotclinical strengthquot deodorant to using a special crystal rocknone can even compare at ALL to Hypercare It has changed my life for the better and now I feel more comfortable at work and wearing new styles It does burn a bit after applying but the pain is totally worth the outcome of having dry armpits Best product Ive used Cheers to Hypercare
7218,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40635,63,Im and my hands were sweaty whenever I thought about itlately Ive been thinking about it all the time cause i was worried about shaking hands andor leaving sweaty marks after me whenever I touched something Its got really bad and I went to see a doctor She told me to try Drysol which I did and it worked great but not at firstit actually made my hands sweat even more probably cause I was stressed about if it was gonna work or not It started to work after applying it twice a day for a few days doc told me to The last time I used it was like nights ago and my palms have been so dry since that I had to use a hand cream Yeah unbelievableJust dont give up on it too fast and it will workgood luck
7219,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40630,1,I had been suffering with excessive sweating in my armpits for at least years before I finally got a doctors opinion Getting this medicine really changed what I did from day to day I use it just once a week and I never find myself sweating anymore Sometimes I feel like Im sweating but when I look I dont have a speck of sweat The only problem I have with this medicine is that every time I apply it my arm pits get extremely itchy and sometimes I will wake up with a rash but I guess thats just the price of not having sweat anymore I strongly advise you to talk to your doctor about this medicine if youre having the same problem Dont be scared to ask
7220,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40625,1,My armpits used to sweat through anything no matter what I tried every deodorantantiperspirant I could find even combined with baby powder I really could never get a grip on the problem and it ruined a lot of shirts trying Im and have had insanely wet pits for years now I live in New England and even when it is degrees outside my pits would sweat crazy Long story short Hypercare knocked everyone of my sweat glands in my pits out of commission I use it every few days and after awhile it will burn and itch but it is just the price you pay for awesome effectiveness Hypercare is amazing
7221,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40623,2,LOVE it I wish I would have tried to get it years ago
7225,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40606,3,I started using Drysol in high school It was a miracle No more sweat marks No more wearing a cardigan with every SINGLE outfit It was FREEDOM I donut have to be embarrassed anymore thanks to DYRSOL
7229,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40591,10,I have been using Drysol for about years The whole story is ladies do not shave or use if you have any cuts Also do not use the plastic roll it on or put it on very lightly and a small amount I use a tee shirt with short sleeves that is slightly tight under the arm I used it for the first days and since then I use it about twice a month in the winter and once a week in the summer I live in Floridait works I was a wet bucket before
7231,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40591,12,I started using Drysol about years ago and it has been amazing I was sweating in my hands feet and armpits and now it has gotten to the point were I can apply it twice a month and I can last a long time without sweating I am so glad I found it I would recommended for everyone If it doesnt work for you the first time keep trying it It might eventually start working
7232,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,6,40411,1,I started using this about days ago It worked really well in the beginning I didnt sweat or anything I was actually surprised and glad I can finally touch my dogs without getting their hair all over my palms But ever since yesterday my hands and feet have been sweating non stop I read I cant apply it when the area is wetthat it has to be dryso there is no possible way I can apply it Hopefully my hands stop sweating soon
7233,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40410,0,This medicine works wonderfully Be careful when applying because the top will pop off if you squeeze too hard The only downside is that it burns like crazy after the rd application or so
7234,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40405,0,I have always been the type of person who sweats a lot Im very active so I never thought anything of it However I realized that I sweat the most when it is cold and Im doing nothing but sitting at my desk in school I tried the clinical strength deodorants and they helped a little bit Finally I decided to talk to my doctor and they gave me this product Im only on my second day of use and Im already amazed The first night I experienced intense itching however it was manageable The next day I played in a tournament for hours in degree weather and my shirt wasnt even wet This product is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone with an overactive sweat problem
7235,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40400,2,For years Ive been sweating so much that keeping my arms down wasnt enough The sweat would creep about inches out Id always wear jackets and say I dont want to tan I live in Arizona That is impossible It does not snow here and it is always degrees Walking home is not smart and Drysol Secret clinical strength all clinical strengths regular deodorants Arid dry creme and the home remedies like baking soda NOTHING WORKED Went to my doctor she easily said Hypercare because its worked in her year career and none of the people she prescribed it to complained I had doubts IT WORKS
7236,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40395,14,Hypercare is the best I dont sweat anymore Now I can go out in pubic without worrying about huge sweat stains appearing on my shirt I dont have to worry about wearing hoodies sweaters or jackets to school to cover up my soaking wet shirts especially in the summer time after school I have been a heavy sweater for years since th grade to th I should have tired this years ago No more skipping out on activities with friends or just teenage stuff I can finally be me I recommend this to anyone with the problem If it does not work for you dont give up Keep trying to find a good product that works for you
7239,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40393,1,Hypercare is incredible for my armpits Wet spots still show on my Tshirts sometimes but not a lot At least theyre not dripping like they used to the downside is that if used too much it will burn Once every or days is good enough Another thing is that this doesnt really work for my hands and feet Overall this is great
7242,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40359,1,I would get dressed in the morning and by the time I was heading out the door to go to school or work Id have to change my shirt because of the sweat that was dripping from my armpits I just became accustomed to bringing a sweater everywhere and wearing loose fitting clothes I started using this medication and the next day which happened to be a degree day I was so surprisedhappy to have no sweat running down my arms The first night I used it I applied it to my armpits that had been shaved in the morning it stungitch but I stuck it out I now apply it every other day and just shave my armpits every other day It doesnt itchsting at all I recommend this to everyone
7245,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40337,12,I agree with most of the other users here that this is an amazing product I have had hyperhidrosis for a couple of years and sort of learned to live with it rather than treat it as a medical condition and get treatment Aside from some itching and irritation at night I cant think of anything bad about this medicine For the first time in years I dont have to hide my underarms or wipe my hands on my jeans before shaking hands with someone And I just went to the store to buy some lightcolored shirts HypercareDrysol is really lifechanging for me Thanks to you all for sharing your experiences and if anyone reading this discussion suffers from hyperhidrosis I hope you will give this drug a try
7246,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40332,4,I am almost years old When I was pretty young I had not a HINT of a sweating problem Then once I got a little older it all started I was extremely embarrassed to shake peoples hands and even more embarrassed when my friends asked me quotWhy are your hands so wetquot and I would always lie and say quotOh I just washed themquot I would always wear a jacket to cover my hands and I would constantly be wiping my hands I finally convinced my mom to take me to a doctor and they prescribed Hypercare Although at some points in the day my fingertips would sweat the problem is almost COMPLETELY gone Thanks Hypercare you saved me
7247,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40326,36,I have used this for years and it really works I used to have wet arm pits all the time and not only is it embarassing but it ruins my clothes Put this on at night generously and I promise the next day you will remain dry and confident I dont even have to use it every nightI only use it every nights
7248,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40322,1,This product is absolutely AMAZING I am so glad that I have found something that finally works I used it one night it itched and burned but I braved through it because pain is beauty I use it one day and for the next days I had not drop of sweat Just used it again last night and Im still bone dry Love it
7250,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,6,40321,7,Ive had hyperhidrosis for as long as I can remember especially on my hands and feet My dermatologist prescribed it to me last week Ive been using Hypercare for a few days now its definitely dried my skin out and I havent been sweating as much Yet I still have the occasional outbreaks However I talked to my doctor who said that it takes usually around weeks for the product to really affect you Im hanging in there and so far satisfied
7251,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40314,1,Nothing bad I can say other than your first couple treatments youll feel the itch and burn Life changing medicine Thank you hypercare
7252,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40313,10,Wow I had been struggling with excessive underarm sweating for several years and more recently the sweating was made worse by a prescription medication I wore only black and other dark colors for months and I couldnt even wear sleeveless tops because the sweat would sometimes drip down my arms Finally went to my doctor in frustration and she immediately prescribed Xerac AC noting that this had worked for many of her patients I used it very sparingly the first night dabbed it on carefully mainly because Id read about the potential for stinging discomfort The next day I was still sweating but only about of what I had been The next night I applied a bit more and it only stung a bit Next day NO SWEAT Recommended
7253,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40301,5,I am years old I have been having a sweating problem since I was years old I would sweat day and night I would wake up with huge sweat drenched shirts go take a shower throw a new shirt on and in under minutes I got a brand new drenched shirt I am a very social person I go to a lot of parties meet a lot of people even play sports but something always holds me back from going to some parties or going to some places because of this bad sweating problem I have I would wear different zipper hoodies to hide my sweating problem wear almost all black shirts to hide the very embarrassing problem The very first night I got this medicine my whole life changed I am sweat free and can wear any color I want
7254,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40296,12,HELLO FELLOW SWEATERS I was the worst sweater ever Everyday regardless of what I was wearing I had huge armpit stains and I mean huge Like a good inches in diameter And it didnt matter what material I was wearing or what color it was noticeable I would also sweat through huge hooded sweatshirts I have no idea how that is even possibleWhen I came on this website I read everyones reveiws and thoughtquottheres no way anyone on here sweats as much as I do Its not gonna work for mequot but I was wrong The first couple nights I applied it it stung a lot and itched too but I toughed it out because at that point I didnt care And the next day TA DAA No sweat Not even a dropit was amazing Goodluck
7255,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,2,40282,8,So far not so good Ive been using it for about a week and a half and I still sweat My dermatologist said I CAN use my regular deodorantantiperspirant if Im paranoid this might not work Well I didnt the first time I used Hypercare because I wanted to see if it would work I smelled an odor so the next day I used my deodorant Also I DO NOT like the applicator I have been using a sponge to apply mine
7256,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40254,5,Ive been using the product for about month and the sweating is absolutely gone My doctor recommended the Botox treatment but HyperCare is a much cheaper alternative It did itch for the first weeks but has since subsided and there is no longer any itching or burning I also notice that I can now skip days and the sweating is still managed Great product
7258,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40028,2,Amazing product for me from the age of about it had gotten to the point where I would sweat so much all the time that I wore baggy sweatshirts constantly Even sometimes in the summer to hide all the sweating After using Hypercare I rarely sweat unless Im exercising or its legitimately hot which is GREAT
7259,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40024,42,I was sweating all the time and had to showerchange up to times a day Used the DrySol nights in a row under arms feet even top of legs and under belly When dry I put plastic over all areas covered feet with socks wore nightie with sleeves undies heldin plastic at top of legs The idea is to use at bedtime in this manner so the product doesnt ruboff AND because this is when the sweat glands are most dormant Now I only need it twice a week I use regular deodorant in the morning Keep in mind You only need a very small amount to prevent burning your skin Otherwise it must be washed off Dab under arms ONLY where hair grows Dont use after shaving I can now wear tops TWICE and can wear regular shoes DrySol youre the best
7261,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40011,6,For some reason the stinging only happens to me when I use it at night To avoid the stinging I now use it in the morning after I shower and towel off The day I use it I dont wear clothes that I worry about staining Drysol has worked fantastic for years under my arms I now only have to use it about once a week Unfortunately no matter how I use it on my feet it hasnt helped them
7264,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,39946,19,Ive had hyperhidrosis for years I would embarrassingly sweat through multiple shirts daily Business meetings were awful I would actually adhere my wifes menstrual pads to my undershirts to try and get me through the day but would eventually sweat through those too In a recent visit to my dermatologist he prescribed DrysolHypercare Skeptically I applied it that night It burned and itched keeping me up all night The next day I was COMPLETELY dry I applied it again the next night still itched but not as bad slight rash I took the next nights off to let my armpits heal and still no sweat Im on my nd week rd application and NO SWEAT Far less irritation now dry and couldnt be happier truly life changing
7265,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,39938,30,I suffered from EXTREME hyperhidrosis for eleven years since the age of thirteen I used to wear several layers of clothing including paper towels under my arms to try to disguise the problem but to no avail I would sweat through several layers of clothing Greatly to my surprise after just two weeks of using Hypercare MY SWEATING CEASED Because the active ingredient in it is an alcohol solution you can apply as many layers as you need without a nasty buildup of gunk that come with regular solid and gel antiperspirants I really thought I was going to need botox or surgery but ended up trying this product at the urging of my dermatologist SO HAPPY
7266,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,39903,1,I just started using this product and I like it already I hope to see great results in the future
7267,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,39887,23,I have very sweaty palms that I unfortunately inherited from my mother and father I just started using Hypercare one week ago and applied it nightly I have seen a wonderful change in such a short period of time My sweaty hands affected me in social and religious settings which included shaking hands It used to be so embarrassing to watch the reaction on the other persons face when they shook my wet palms Hypercare has made me feel so much happier like a weight lifted off my shoulders I cant say enough about it
7268,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,39868,6,I have only recently been suffering with underarm hyperhydrosis It started about months ago Im It is a terribly frustrating condition that impacts your standard of living I have just started using Hypercare With the first application of Hypercare my condition improved dramatically With the second application I am dry all day long It does cause some irritation of the skin under the arm but now Im on my th day of using it and that irritation has subsided
7269,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,39672,96,I have had hyperhidrosis of my hands armpits and feet my entire life It made many things in my life extremely uncomfortable or impossible to do Even simple things shaking hands preparing food wearing grey or any nondark Tshirts wearing sandals the list goes on Ive been using Hypercare for years now and it has literally changed my life Its affordable and effective I recommend to anyone suffering from hyperhidrosis
7270,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,1,40589,3,I started to notice that I sweat a lot so I went to the doctor yesterday and she prescribed Hypercare When I got home I put it on and about minutes later my under arms started to burn and swell and was red I was up all night long in pain and couldnt do anything about it and Im still sweating today
7271,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,3,40583,1,I am In school I would hate to raise my hand which made me fall behind in math because I wasnt asking questions in choir we would have to do stretches and warm ups with movement I however just sat there People started to notice and I would be angry Then I got Hypercare it worked for about a half hour then I started sweating again
7273,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40572,3,Ive suffered from severe underarm sweat for years after I had my first baby it only got worse I have nothing but black shirts in my closet because I was too embarrassed of my sweat stains to wear any colored tops My first night using Hypercare was last night and today not one drop of sweat or any smell from my armpits I feel like a new woman and cant wait to see it improve even more I am going shopping soon to get some colored shirts and I cant wait
7274,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40558,2,Im and I have suffered from excessive underarm sweating for many years Whenever I would get ready for school Id have to determine if the sweat would be noticeable on my top Black tops and layering were the easiest options but I was jealous of the people who could wear anything At one school dance I wore a strapless pink dress at the sweat marks were visible in all the pictures Completely mortifying I tried pretty much every deodorant out there Clinical strength all different brands but nothing was effective some made me even sweat more Hypercare has been a huge help in my life I usually have the itchingstingingburning feeling when I am trying to go to sleep but honestly its worth it because it truly works
7275,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40553,1,I am in th grade and its my first day after I applied it It worked til about the rd hour class then started to sweat a little Not so much people noticed but I am super selfconscious and was paranoid I hope it gets better for gym the next day Since the beginning of last year I had to wear sweaters every day or Id have soaked underarms Today I wore only a plaid over shirt and barely sweat again hope for better results soon
7277,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,1,40545,7,Im in th grade Ive had hyperhidrosis since I was in th grade My doctor gave me this and I tried it for months now and it DOES NOT work for me I was really disappointedI dont know what to do
7279,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,40534,8,Used this last night for the first time on hands feet and underarms By the time I was done applying it and got into bed the plastic wrap around my hands and feet had little droplets of moisture inside and I had sweated big circles under the arms of my tshirt I was very discouraged I felt no burningstingingitching whatsoever Woke up washed it all off and so far I am sweating still but only about half of normal Pretty good product hope it gets better
7281,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40523,1,I am and I used to sweat like crazy So my mom made me a doctors appointment and my doctor told me to try Hypercare The first night I tried it it burned but the next day I was COMPLETELY dry I recommend HYPERCARE
7284,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40477,1,First off I would like to say that this medical condition is not known to many people and I think its awful I have suffered from hyperhidrosis since I was in high school I was unable to wear whatever I wanted stuck to baggy sweatshirts and black tees I figured Id just grow into it because my job was very physical and I was not the only one sweating I am going on interviews now and I have had enough of it I applied it last night and I didnt start sweating until about pm today I did not put deodorant on because of the directions and had to by pm I am going to try it again tonight I am happier to use it than not and will upload my future comments on it because I did not see many after thoughts and I think that its needed
7286,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40465,5,I have been suffering from severe sweating since th grade It wasnt just a situation of not being able to raise up my armsI had to wear black shirts every day or the sweat stains would show Even in the middle of the winter I would sweat Finally I asked my doctor for Hypercare which I had heard about from a friend I used it for the first time last night and today was amazing I wore a tight green shirt and I didnt sweat all day I did feel like I was sweating at points but when I checked there was no wetness There was some burning when I put it on but it was well worth it This is an amazing product
7288,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40438,1,I am years old and I have been sweating since I started college I turned into a huge loser I hung out in my basement on Friday and Saturday nights because I couldnt go out with my friends without sweating nonstop under my arms I finally got the courage to talk to my doctor about it I have been using this product for two days now and it is a miracle No sweating at all not even when I work out I am so much more happy now and I have the confidence to conquer all of my dreams THANK YOU HYPERCARE I LOVE YOU
7289,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,6,40435,4,Ive sweated excessively since about th grade I would always get comments on it and I would avoid doing a lot of physical activity But when I reached th grade and had gym everyday I realized how embarrassing it was to be the only one covered in buckets of sweat I was really self conscious about it until I saw a dermatologist He prescribed Hypercare and it worked immediately after I started using it After a few weeks though I noticed a lot of irritation I had been following all instructions but my under arms were blood red I saw the dermatologist again and he prescribed Xerac ac Its not as irritating but unfortunately less effective
7291,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40417,20,Its a miracle Hypercare saved my life I had been suffering from smelling arm pits all my life to the point that used to have all the time baby wipes and a deodorant in my purse to refresh my under arms I dont need to do that anymore thanks to Hypercare I can deal with the burning andor itching Im years old and for the first time in twenty something years I found something that works AND WHEN I SAY IT WORKS I MEAN IT WORKS
7292,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40415,5,Im and prior to Hypercare I would sweat all the time It started probably years ago I tried all sorts of deodorants baking soda clinical strength nothing worked for me I mentioned my issue with my doctor and he prescribed this to me last night was the first time I applied it and it was pretty painful like little pricks of needles but I have to say over the entire day I did not sweat once It was like the thing I was most concerned and self conscious about disappeared This product will definitely change my life if you are reading this and considering asking your doctor about this I would recommend doing so and for your information deodorant can be used with this for odor for armpits I asked my doctor its all good
7294,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40412,28,I cant remember a time when I DIDNT sweat That all changed a month ago I bought Drysol and also the mild Drysol for my face I was unsure about it at first because when I put it on the tingling was very intense The first day I only left it on for four hours and then washed it off because I couldnt take the tingling The second night I went all nightthe tingling was less I only did those two nights and I didnt sweat for almost a week I use it under my arms and the mild Drysol on my face I do not recommend it to anyone with really sensitive skin but I DO recommend it to anyone who is desperate for a solution to their problem with hyperhidrosis
7295,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40227,4,Absolutely felt better in years i have never used any medication prior to this so i was absolutely skeptical about my issue this morning i waited and waited for that steady drip down my armpit and it never came and it was only the first day i used it I was absolutely ECSTATIC now i can wear clingy shirts and cute tops without ever worrying about there being a nasty stain or worse having someone see the sweat Btw the stinging are only small side effects neverthless no pain no gain
7298,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40217,4,This product is amazing I went up to my aunts house for weeks and I told her about my condition She gave me Hypercare because my cousin said it didnt work for her I figured I would try it I applied it and it burned itched and stung But the next day I didnt sweat at all The pain got so bad that I just stopped using it But a few nights ago I found this website and read the reviews and applied it again dealing with the pain I recommend to anybody This all started when I was about in th grade Now im in th and I dont have all the insecurities
7299,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,7,40190,2,Finally I decided to try it and after using it twice the next day I didnt sweat but my armpits still smelt and I was afraid to put deodorant because it said not to so I didnt The rd night it burned like hell and itched I washed it off and stopped I waited two days and I started again its itching but not burning
7300,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40187,1,It worksor at least is working so far I put it on last night and it burned and itched but so worth it It was hard using it with the top they give you for your underarms but I noticed if you tip bottle upside down couple min before you use it it will soak top and makes it a little easier I have not sweat at all today I put on last night washed it off in shower and applied thin layer of my deodorant on I have changed into shirts I know I sweat bad in and it is very noticeable but not today I have been walking around in front of my husband saying do you see sweatand NO he doesnt I asked different doctors couple of years ago and they said there is nothing we can do but my new doctor prescribed to me Thank you
7301,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,9,40160,1,I have had hyperhidrosis since the th or th grade and it really is one of the worst things that you can have when you are trying to have a social life I started hypercare days ago and it works like magic Like many others was stuck to wearing black and white Ts and tank tops Not anymore The first day I got it I wore grey Not a sweat mark at all The only downside is that the pain of it is horrible because it burns so bad Im only on my third day and I hope that it starts to lessen soon but other than that it truly is a blessing
7302,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,4,40152,4,I used Louis Widmer up until now no irritation at all and works perfectly This Drysol product stings and doesnt work nearly as good
7303,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40147,1,Hypercare WORKS It was fantastic And since its an externallyapplied product your body wont quotadaptquot to it over time amp lessen the effect it can provide
7306,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40114,65,HyperCare is truly amazing Worked after the very first application for my yr old daughter We tried every deodorant including Certain Dry amp all the clinical strength products which did not work at all she would still come home from school soaking wet in her armpit area I really did not want to have her injected with botox but was seriously going to check into it because of the damage the sweating was doing to her self esteem HyperCare did cause some irritation but my daughter says it is absolutely worth it she is sooo happy and excited to be able to wear any color shirt now I had no idea that it was that big of a problem for her because she didnt tell me because she was embarrassed about it Absolutely recommend this product
7307,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40104,116,I just want to say that Drysol really works for me its been weeks now and Ive used it like times and havent seen a drop from my armpits yet Let me tell you how good Drysol is I put it on Thursday the day I got it and my armpits were dry that whole weekend All I did is took a shower for everyday I went out Friday Saturday and on Sunday I was at the game I didnt have time to put it on more than once that whole weekend and my armpits were dried Nothing works like Drysol Im writing this because I hope this post helps someone else I did a lot of research but Im done This is my last stop I just wanted to leave feedback and big thanks to people who made it
7308,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40100,29,I had the same problem Always had to wear black or a zipper upsweater to cover it My doctor prescribed this to me and its like a gift from heaven It burned so bad though I couldnt really take it so for all you girls out there that try it and have the same results ask your doctor to prescribe you triamcinolone lotion You put it on after and theres no burning or swelling or anything And it leaves your underarms super soft for shaving rather than irritated from the treatment I definitely recommend this
7310,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40097,17,Miracle drug New lease on life I keep pinching myself
7312,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40076,14,This product truly is amazing I am years old and since I was in the th grade I have had a problem with my sweating I always avoided really cute tops and dresses that I knew I would sweat in and ruin Basically all my tops are black and it was still visible that I was sweating I never wore tight shirt always real loose fitting and I was just miserable Finally I got over my embarrassment and ask my gynecologist what I can do about this sweating problem and she prescribed Hypercare It stung so badly and I had so much irritation that I wanted to cry but I am so glad I kept using it because that burning was so worth it I can wear ANYTHING I want no matter the fit or color It is amazing and I feel so beautiful and happy I recommend this product
7313,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,2,40075,3,Did not work that well
7314,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40074,42,I suffered from excessive sweating since I was about years old Ill never forget it It was WINTER and I took off my coat and saw sweat under my arms through my sweater This continued for YEARS It was embarrassing Being nervous definitely increased this issue When I reached about years old I was using paper towels under my shirts attached to my bras Summer time was dreaded I was miserable I owned tons of black shirts In the summer Id walk one block and my armpits would be drenched Now to be perfectly honest I am a beautiful woman Mixed race slim nice hair light eyes But no matter what the sweating made me want to hide Indoors All the time Just sitting still made me sweat It was horrible
7315,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40069,2,I have suffered from severe underarm perspiration for many years I would only wear tops that were black or white Even through many layers of clothing my shirt stains under my arms were terrible I would worry that people could see my sweat and that would make me sweat even MORE This product is AMAZING I never thought it would be this easy to get rid of the problem Just follow the instructions on the bottle and your life will be SO MUCH BETTER Sometimes it feels like it is warm in my underarm area and I freak out that I am sweating but when I look there is nothing there This is an incredible product VERY highly recommended
7316,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40067,2,I use to get called quothydroquot because my arms leaked water I tried hypercare without shaving my under arms or reading the directions and felt like it didnt help After reading the directions and shaving my arms so that the product could actually reach my skin Ive had amazing results Life feels different I can now wear any color teeshirt I can live without the fear that someone will touch my wet underarms and I can wear expensive leather coats without ruining them This is the best product made and I wish I would have known about it years earlier
7317,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40059,4,My family has a history of perspiration problems and I have finally found the solution Ive tried antiperspirants Certain Dri and various OTC products but Hypercare was the one that really worked This sounds like one of those commercials that you shouldnt really believe but this is real stuff Im so its common for people my age to be wearing tshirts to school that fit and the occasional dress shirt for formal gatherings I couldnt wear shirts that fit me because they would touch my underarm and then the sweat would stain my shirts I wore baggy shirts for the longest time It could be degrees outside and Id still sweat Now in this New England humidity I can wear whatever I want without humidity being a problem
7318,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,10,40059,7,Amazing Used to sweat so badly under arms It was so embarrassing to have sweat stains when I was barely doing anything One night of using this and I instantly did not sweat the next day And you only have to use it once or twice a week after you stop sweating Tried everything and this truly works Stings pretty bad the first time but thought it was well worth it Did not feel a thing after the first time though
7319,Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,8,40050,12,Im years old and have been suffering from underarm sweetness since I was I hated going shopping and buying shirts because I couldnt wear any light colors only black As I got older it got worse and I didnt really like talking to other people and in class I wouldnt raise my hand My mom decided to take me to my doctor and he told me about Hypercare The first night I tried it it itched and burned but the next day I didnt SWEAT I was happy and thank my doctor Good thing they invented this product and know that Im going to high school and I can socialize with a lot of people without being afraid Yay
7320,Omnipaque 350,Body Imaging,7,42606,1,Had a precautionary CT scan on my chest several days after hip surgery and after experiencing some pain in my chest The contrast agent used was Omnipaque About hours later when lying down in bed I felt itching on my back which persisted into the night On inspection I could see that a hives type rash had formed between my shoulder blades This gradually subsided over about daysNote that the scan showed up a small infection for which I was prescribed a penicillin antibiotic I took this about hours before the rash appeared so my doctor changed the antibiotic as a precaution in case that caused the rash I have never been allergic to penicillin so in my mind the Omnipaque remains the culprit
7321,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1,42996,5,This cream will make you want to take your vagina off it is so itchy Funny but very true I will not use this product again The severity of the itching is scary I hadnt horrific nights and ok days with this product

7323,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,7,42988,3,Reading all of these reviews I was a bit scared that I was gonna experience what these ladies have but I must say I was very fortunate not to feel like my vag was being burned off Perhaps the burning correlates with the severity of the infection Idk but I did feel a slight burn but nothing crazy I applied it at night and when I woke up my genitals were less swollen Im still itchy but not as itchy as before I started monistat Its not an immediate cure I will say that So have patience please and if u can go to the drs instead please do so That would of been my choice but lucky me I got it on a Friday and my drs office is closed so here I am But I feel better and I cant wait to see how it completely heals in a few days
7324,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,5,42984,2,Im and this is my first YI The first night was absolute hell I laid on my floor rolling around and bawling before I got up and sat in the bath to get it out Night two and three I also had to go to the bath and get it out Now Im on night four and Im fighting through it it was itchy for about minutes and now its finally stopping This product side effects are really bad Im not going to lie but during the day I feel a lot better it hardly itches and its not swollen anymore The external cream is very helpful if you apply it in the morning I dread inserting the cream at night but hopefully itll get better This cures your YI it just sucks

7351,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1,42762,8,I frequently get yeast infections Ive used the monistat once before with no problems Went to use it tonight and within mins the itching and burning was so unbearable I cried Did they change something After reading other reviews I guess Im not the only one who has expierenced this Not sure if sucking up the next nights is even worth it Do not recommend You are better off with the itching and buring from the yeast infection itself

7360,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,3,42608,5,I had used this product before and never had a problem It seemed to help clear up the infection quite quickly But I recently got another yeast infection and decided to use the product again I would not reccomend it at all I got intense burning in my lower region It got so uncomfortable within about minutes that I had to take a shower and wipe all the medicine out Afterwards I was still in pain Do not get monistat At all Yeast infections already itch and monistat made it times worse plus insane burning Hopefully I wont have any rashes or swelling like the others Definently go see a doctor and get a prescription

7425,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,9,42178,19,I have used this in the past due to taking antibiotics after having a tooth pulled I am weeks pregnant and day one is the worse I was on fire for about minutes then i started reading peoples post on here and after laughing so hard the burning is gone This is my second time having to use this and Im years old I know its not funny to have a YI but I got a good chuckle out of the fact Im not the only one on fire over here Thanks Product clears infection in days
7426,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,2,42176,7,Very itchy feeling from this cream I dont think it helped me at all
7427,Monistat 7-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1,42153,20,I just used this cream almost hours ago and I think my vagina is about to fall off It is worse than before The intense burning sensation and discomfort I was doing well with the vinegar so I dont know why I bought this mess Never again
7430,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,43078,0,So many other reviews on here but this drug is important I will chime in as well since it has been prescribed a little different for me I used to wake up in a panic a couple of times a week but its pretty easy for me to gauge my stress level and predict which nights are going to be bad ones I take or mg or nights a week before am or Ill be so zonked I dont respond to my alarm It does the trick so I can fall right back to sleep after waking instead of panicking and then ruminating for hours and being a mess at work and with my kids the next day It works so well amp I can easily see how it would be addictive but its a lifechanger so I am very careful
7433,Xanax,Anxiety,9,43030,6,Works excellent for anxiety Have horrible social anxiety which I also take Zoloft for but xanax doesnrsquot really help with it Not knowing cause my Drrsquos didnrsquot tell me but after being on this a while and at a high dose for me up to mgday if you donrsquot take it everyday you feel like rubbish Took me almost years to figure this out so regardless if I need it or not I take maybe mg as a maintenance dose in the middle of the day Greatly helps to not feel sick I also take mg of Temazepam at night which I thought would cover me But for the past days my mood has been really bad the worst in years and a couple mgrsquos of Xanax greatly improves it but wouldnrsquot recommend it since itrsquos not prescribed to take it that way
7434,Xanax,Anxiety,10,43023,14,I was diagnosed with panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder years ago I suffered for many years during that time and did not take any medication with the view that I would fix the issue naturally I tried the natural way for years avoidance behaviour became the norm and a way of coping years ago I was at tipping point in a very stressful job and finally was prescribed xanax alprazolam by a GP For the first time since my teens when the anxiety began I finally had relief This medication has been a complete game changer for me and has improved my quality of life by I have been taking mg twice a day for the past years and havent had to increase the dosage This medication is now sadly classified as a level drug in Australia due to people who dont need it abusing the drug and ruining it for those who really need it My psychiatrist is now trying to switch me to Ativan I have been taking it for approximately a month now and it makes me feel depressed and empty and I have never had depression I need mg to ease my anxiety double the dose of xanax and it basically makes me feel like crap Feeling incredibly overwhelmed and annoyed that this medication which has helped me so much will probably no longer be available in Australia
7435,Xanax,Depression,10,43021,1,Autumn depression
7436,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,43020,6,Life saver for me BUT only because I take it when I truly need it I suffer from day to day anxiety but I do not take it for that I try to get rid of anxiety other natural ways But I do suffer from severe panic attacks especially night time So I only take it when I am having an attack I am on the lowest dose possible and I can get away with taking even just half of that sometimes It takes the edge off very fast and I feel so much better shortly after Take it on average times a month sometime less rarely more Extremely addictive med so I urge you to stay away from it for daily use or if you have an addictive personality
7437,Xanax,Anxiety,1,43011,23,STAY AWAY FROM XANAX Please It will help you in the moment But literally hours later the rebound anxiety and insomnia will hit you and make you regret taking it at all in the first place And before you know it youll go from half a bar to multiple bars just to sleep at night Oh and the increased despersonalizion and dark thoughts are not potential quotside effectsquot they are some of the many very real consistently DIRECT EFFECTS of taking Xanax Benzos should be used as rarely and as shortterm as possible Even in these cases the withdrawal is VERY realit hurts just to live Please Take my word for it Im going through it for the TENTH time right now ADDICTIVE
7438,Xanax,Anxiety,10,43006,23,Xanax has been great for me I have suffered horribly for years from GAD PTSD bipolar disorder fibromyalgia and many more health problems It actually gives me energy to get things done and allows for peace and tranquility Im prescribed mg per day and it also helps me sleep at night Ive had trouble sleeping for years but this medication has helped so much
7439,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42995,19,Xanax has helped me with my activitys anxiety I have a hard time going out being around people especially when going places like the doctors shopping I have a hard time being around people or even just going outdoors also just going outside in general I dont like being away from home thats my safe zone I get scared when I here loud loud noises Im afraid people are going to hurt me or the ones I love I am happy with my dogs and cats want to be left alone Away from the rest of the world here are only a few that I can trust my mother father My Dave plus my children plus my therapist Mark
7440,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,42992,16,I have been on Xanax for years Im only years old While this is a miracle drug for pulling you out of a panic attack and preventing them This medicine works extremely well for my anxiety that said it can cause a very nasty dependence and addiction where you will need larger and larger doses to combat this rebound anxiety this is what the Dr call it Its your brain screaming for more of the drug this is not only a mental dependency but also a very strong physical one If you are thinking about taking Xanax remember less is more the less you take the better it works It has become part of my daily meds mg to times a day and thats coming from being on the max dose legally available mg daily you dont want that Use Caution
7441,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42985,40,I got prescribed mg of Xanax that I take once a day My wife had just died My anxiety was so bad I would not leave the house nor would I barely eat It made me feel alive again and Im able to function and get out and socialize like a normal person again I actually have a appetite now and Im getting good sleep again which I havent felt in a long time Xanax really saved my life
7444,Xanax,Panic Disorde,5,42959,14,I was on Xanax for a couple of years for severe panic attacks I started out on mg and soon that was not enough I had to keep increasing the dose as my panic and anxiety increased I ended up becoming agoraphobic I could not leave my house without taking a handful of Xanax first In the end I was taking way way way too much enough to kill an elephant I know it sounds hard to believe Its amazing I am still alive I had to beg my insurance company to put me in the hospital to detox I tried to kill myself I almost died while in the hospital They took me down to mg a day and I had a grand mal seizure and almost died It was the most horrible experience of my life Be careful Its highly addicting
7445,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42958,35,Panic disorder is no fun You feel like you have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide and that you are coming to an end Xanax has helped me against this terrible nervousness demonic feeling I only take it when I truly need it I take the lowest dose possible The thing about this drug is that it makes you feel so relaxed So people keep taking it to keep feeling good and thats when it backfires Please only take it as needed Dont take it if your not feeling panic at the moment You have to respect this drug And taking it when u dont feel panic is not the way to go Trust me Prayer and a lil help from xanax can make all the difference in the world
7446,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42956,45,Since my dad got sick and eventually passed away my anxiety depression and fears were just over whelming Ive been having so many intrusive thoughts since then I had mild depression before he passed its been years and its finally just has destroyed me I finally went and got help two weeks ago and xanax not only completely calms me down it helps me focus on thing I need to focus on and not let my mind wonder with anxiety and weird thoughts Miracle drug Dont abuse it Use when needed its amazing
7449,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42945,20,Until yesterday I was prescribed mg Alprazolamxanax for panic anxiety and irregular sleep patterns I took them for four yearsI went to my psychiatrist yesterday for my monthly suboxone appointment yrs The same psychiatrist who prescribed my mgxanax I am taking suboxone for chronic pain issues from a MVA I had been on prescription oxycontin mg xsd for yrs and that doctor retiredno doctor would prescribe a full opiate agonist and that was yrs ago So I was told yesterday that he could no longer prescribed both xanax and suboxone due to state and federal guidelines This type of inappropriate prescribing is outrageousHas anyone else come up against this I never abused either medications
7451,Xanax,Anxiety,1,42945,9,I was given an extremely low dosage of this dont know if that was part of the problem but it didnt do anything for me good or bad
7452,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42944,22,Im a year old girl and Ive been diagnosed with Anxiety for a long time but never had an anxiety attack until now My doctor prescribed me this medicine yesterday after I told her I had an anxiety attack day ago My heart was literally at a speed of but she gave me medicine to slow it down It really helped me sleep last night too This medicine took me about minutes to kick in and then it knocked me out and I was fast asleep
7453,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,42937,17,About a year ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety with panic attacks Anxiety runs in my family so for me it was not a huge shock for me to have anxiety I have tried about three different medications that just made me feel awful I did not feel like myself and I was always sleepy Once I got put on Xanax with another type of anxiety medication it helped subside my panic attacks Anytime I would have a panic attack I would take a Xanax and it would help me be able to fell like myself again I do not take Xanax every day just because I do not have panic attacks everyday and because it is highly addicted For me this medication worked
7454,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42932,9,It really calms me down
7455,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42927,15,Xanax is like putting a bandaid over a wound that needs stitches This med helped take the edge off my anxiety and am thankful for it It will NOT treat GAD properly because youll be dependent with too many doses but is a godsend for panic disorders I still struggle with anxiety anger headaches worrying crazy thoughts It helped me be able to sleep socialize not have panic attacks at work great sex drive and I feel calm I was prescribed mg twice a day usually took less otherwise Id be sleeping all day only could go about a day without it then I need it again for anxiety The biggest downside is that it makes me REALLY tired lazy poor memory sometimes When mixed with alcohol I get very angry Will be looking into SSRIs
7456,Xanax,Anxiety,7,42926,23,Xanax is a medication that must be taken seriously and with precaution This is not a game Taking it when you dont need to will only create addiction and the withdrawal is worse than living with the actual anxiety Please dont take this med unless you suffer from anxiety and you are having a panic attack It works well in these situations but my advice is to stay away from it and only take it in an emergency I prefer lorazepam When you take lorazepam the withdrawal symptoms are more tolerable than xanax Xanax is awesome but it can become Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde You can die from this or get a DUI if you are caught in a driving accident This is serious
7457,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42924,11,I was given this after trying several other meds My doctor gave me mg bars The yellow ones generic arent bad and the white one isnt either but them green ones will wipe you out They are at least stronger despite being the same strength The use to be very expensive but are only for a pill supply with my insurance which is bootleg Obama care
7459,Xanax,Depression,10,42906,27,Ive started to take Xanax months ago then mg a day Experienced a rapid heartbeat at first but chose to give it a chance anyway and after weeks it was back to normal Now I take Xanax and Bupropion mg a day for my depression and anxiety I can tell it really has changed my life so far I can feel joy or calmness again before I couldnt at all I hope to get back to normal soon Cant even describe how Im glad Ive started to take these medications Although I know many people have severe side effects the thing is its very individual you have to try and find a medicine that works best for you Many people take Prozac but I almost died when took it side effects were terrible I even experienced hallucinations
7461,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42897,19,The most efficacious and useful anxiolytic I have ever had Fast acting and requiring three times a day chronic administration but also along with the recommended mg lorazepam IV when actually suffering an attack and a doc is present by a long way the best acute remedy for anxiety and panic attack
7462,Xanax,Anxiety,2,42897,23,I have been taking Xanax for less than four years to control anxiety mainly before sleep It works really well until it does exactly opposite for its purpose causing more anxiety and distress I have been taking Xanax randomly only to relax me before sleep say times a month times a month and most of the time half of the I noticed that overtime especially in the months I took it more often the anxiety the fast heart beats and confusion and strange muscle weakness were getting beyond tolerable In few words I would tell anyone there that NO ONE should even begin taking this very addictive Xanax Better suffer through your difficulties than using Xanax to ease your anxiety and panic The drug will take you to abyss
7464,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42893,34,I was extremely against Xanax because of knowing people who abused it and being someone who will try homeopathic cures before using prescriptions That said it really helps me I have anxiety I would describe as anywhere from mild severe depending on the day and week But sometimes I get in these intensely anxious thought patterns where I cannot let go its terribleTaking medication during these periods is a godsend It allows me to return back to my normal nonanxious self I rarely have noticed sleepiness as an effect of the medication only when I was already sleepy before taking it If you dont abuse your dose it shouldnt cause you to feel out of it or have memory loss if you truly suffer from anxiety Thats my experience
7465,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42887,30,One day out of the blue I felt lightheaded I was nauseous my legs were tingling and a horrible fear over took me I had every physical test taken All were negative Finally totally desperate and afraid Id have another attack I went to psychiatrists Both diagnosed Panic Disorder Found out it runs in my family Was put on amitriptyline Prozac Busbar Paxil I stuck each one out for weeks The nausea was horrible and the anxiety debilitating Finally I met a psychiatrist who put me on Zanax mg to times a day and mg of Zoloft My life improved immediately He said he hoped the Zoloft would end the panic attacks but it took a combination of both meds I take Xanax times a day Im alive again
7466,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42886,32,Im years old and this medication gave me my life back I have social anxiety hypochondria and occasional panic attacks Id immediately become stiff and uptight at all social events as well as at school It got so bad that it affected my grades After I take a Xanax the anxiety simply vanishes and its replenished with relaxation tranquility and stability All the scary racing thoughts stop and I begin to think more logically and calmly I take mg five times a day as needed Xanax is also wonderful for muscle spasms
7469,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42875,55,Any drug can get a bad wrap because of some people abusing it A lot of doctors dont even like prescribing Xanax because they dont want their patients getting quothookedquot For me I suffer from occasional anxiety attacks and my prescription is quotas neededquot Anxiety attacks can be VERY scary There were a few times I literally thought I was gonna die it was that bad I even went to the ER once because I believed I was having a heart attack They are different for different people I use to smoke and drink a lot of coffee so I think thats what screwed up my body chemistry I dont drink caffeine or smoke anymore All I know is that now that I have my Alprazolam Xanax in my pocket Im not as scared to go places I can live my life again
7470,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42874,19,After switching my medications three times Xanax by far have made the most difference Definitely works
7471,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42874,23,This medication is great for anxiety and panic attacks when used correctly Make sure you dont abuse it or mix with any downers It says its used for short treatment but it can if monitor correctly be used for long term if your doctor physician or psychiatrist thinks it right for you Im very thankful for this medication for it has work wonderfully on reducing anxiety and takes away my panic attacks This is my opinion
7472,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42871,48,I have been through many many years of anxiety Couldnt drive a car couldnt sit through a church service torment This drug helps me focus and function People abuse it but its a Godsend for people with real issues Not everyone is a drug addict that needs xanax I am and a female and my lifes been limited since a trauma at childhood I have post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety to severe limits
7473,Xanax,Depression,10,42866,16,I started xanax yrs ago after taking klonopin for years My life changed for the better instantly Before xanax I was trapped in my own mind constantly worrying instead of enjoying my family It has now become a curse For years been on mg daily and I have severe panic attacks depression and insomnia mg of trazodone for insomnia is not helping so I use my xanax to sleep then I run out early leading to detox Im just going in circles Discussed with my family about going to a detox center and starting over with other meds
7474,Xanax,Anxiety,7,42865,18,Helps wth anxiety but makes me very sleepy really cant take it if have a lot of work to do I only take half a dose
7475,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42863,36,Xanax has saved my life I have GAD panic disorder OCD PTSD and major depressive disorder This medication has made life worth living for me I have been in therapy with a therapist life coach and psychiatrist for years now I can tell you if the drug makes you drowsy or hungover its not for you Also the therapeutic dosage should not exceed mg per day ideally around mg per day As long as you stay in therapy and see your psychiatrist regularly you will not become quotaddictedquot or whatever else people feel about this drug IT WORKS
7476,Xanax,Anxiety,1,42855,20,While I found this medication to be effective for anxiety the concentration amp memory loss were terrible and almost cost me my job I didnt really notice anything was wrong until I started my new job Training was a nightmare I couldnt focus long enough to learn anything new I was reading a short list of keywords and by the time I got to I couldnt remember I couldnt pay attention long enough to read a book or even a short article I couldnt remember peoples names I had to write everything down I couldnt focus on anything anyone was telling me I would just pretend like I understood Luckily I noticed something was wrong and stopped taking it about months ago My memory and ability to focus have improved
7477,Xanax,Anxiety,7,42849,19,My doctor prescribed mg which I take half a tablet going to bed if that doesnt work I take the other half Depends on how much sleep I need or how much anxiety I have If Im exhausted the medicine is great I fall asleep and next thing I know Im awake in the morning but it usually leaves a hangover which I hate I try to deal with my anxiety holisticly but sometimes that does not work I think it all comes down to eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb and caffeine intake Walking and doing stretches works for me but honestly Having someone who really loves you and does not abuse you in anyway is the best answer but I dont think theres many people out there like that anymore Koliopin is a horrible dangerous drug All pharmaceuticals as far as Im concerned are bad for us and then least we take it the better off we are
7478,Xanax,Anxiety,2,42848,10,Lost what I typed times in a row Xanax is awful Completely blacked out wasted all my fire wood cooking a terrible meal ended up with food everywhere and half of it missing and came to several hours later The rest of these pills are in the bin Worst drug experience of my life
7480,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42626,37,In I started feeling like I was having a heart attack twice a month I ended up in the ER amp was admitted I happen to be one of the lucky females who suffers from hormonal anxiety I was given all the tests possible stayed overnight amp discharged with my first script of the smallest dose of xanax I have used it only AS NEEDED since then and to this day it still helps me at the smallest dose once a day I have gone through some very serious rough patches in my life which had me taking this at most pills maybe four days in a row It works so well that I cant ever imagine taking it more often than needed ~ why would you want to mess up something that works The key is taking it as prescribed just like any medication
7484,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42610,48,I urge anyone to start on the smallest dose as I was pleasantly surprised that a tiny nibble of mg worked amazingly quick and helped curtail a full blown attack I have taken a full mg at once when panic attack was at worst I simply fell asleep and awoke with same anxiety If I take the small dose as I feel the attack coming on it just stops I know everyone is different but I have always been within the mindset that the stronger the better with meds That has not been the case with Zanax for me I also keep in mind this is a med that your body will eventually need more of for equal benefit Its a miracle med for those who have unexplained fear It has saved my marriage
7486,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42605,71,Started at Took it until Its the only medication that ever worked for me I was a guinea pig for months days after taking it it was a miracle medicine I actually called my Dr thanking him I had finally gotten the elephant off my chest Never abused it sometimes dealing with anxiety so as not to get addicted Are there any Drs left that will prescribe real working medication for people who really need but do not abuse it I do not need a psychiatrist I just need as one put it one in hand just in case Doctors today think its taboo to even mention this medication Im not nor do I abuse it I take a mg at night and sleep like a rock Hey Drs this medicine works
7487,Xanax,Depression,7,42598,18,I was prescibed Xanax and it works well for things like panic attacks I do not like that it makes me loopy by taking my prescibed mg and if I cut it in half I feel that it doesnt work at all Xanax works very well for short term anxiety and if highly addictive so it is best to take it when you absolutely NEED it A Prn that is supposed to work like Xanax but isnt addictive starts with a V so ask your doctor about that
7488,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42597,60,I used to honestly be completely against pharmaceuticals in every sense until I developed panic disorder I have intrusive thoughts and experience hypochondria and dissociation literally for hours on end or off and on throughout the entire day Its nearly impossible to even live a normal life feeling this way After talking a mg xanax within minutes all of those negative feelings start to dissipate It has truly been a miracle drug for me and has changed my life for the better
7490,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42597,35,Xanax saved me Apprehensive about taking meds but broke down after it got so bad I didnt even want to take the covers off my head with my eyes clenched shut just fearing every day because I knew anxiety fear of everything under the sun and panic attacks would rule my day I was told I needed to be on long term anxiety drugs so I tried lexapro and ended up in the er with side effects so horrific I dont even want to think of it now Xanax is basically a quick fix to calm the anxiety but its the only thing Im willing to take and over time I broke out of the nightmare I was living I still have bouts of anxiety but as long as I have Xanax on hand I know Ill be ok I never had any bad side effects except for being tired Trade is worth it
7491,Xanax,Anxiety,1,42590,53,Was prescribed xanax alprazolam for GAD First few months were a godsend After I became dependent on them the doctor apparently not understanding the slightest thing about dependence upped the dosage several times I noticed that my anxiety seemed to be getting worse and I was afraid to leave the house a problem I had never had before Took me a while to realize the elephant in the room it was the quotantianxietyquot drugs After withdrawing from the drugs which fortunately was easy compared to the nightmare I have seen some people describe I noticed I felt less anxious and in general more quotalivequot If you feel like your anxiety isnt improving after long term benzo use the root of your problem may be the drugs themselves
7492,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42585,44,I was given xanax in the hospital when people at work thought I was having a heart attack My anxiety shot up so bad my heart rate was Been on mg a day ever since this happen months ago I only take mg a day amp it works for me I feel like I have control of my life again I have heard stories amp seen people on it who over take it but if you take it as prescribed it works
7493,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42585,59,I have chronic panic disorder agoraphobia if not for this drug I would be deadnow with all the conflict goin on about it I wont surviveim a year old man who has been on to mgs a dayhow inhuman these new doctors are
7494,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42551,71,Just wanted to give my experience with Xanax so far I started having genuine anxiety attacks and allday anxiety episodes about two months ago But there were definitely signs of a building anxiety disorder before that As opposed to normal anxiety which we should all try to cope with as best as possible without unnecessary drugs But these attacks had become allday distracting genuinely lifedisrupting experiences tense muscles constant intrusive thoughts inability to concentrate on other things etc At that point theres something wrong and it needs to be diagnosed Xanax works like a tourniquet for your mind and sometimes you just need that It wont cure the underlying issues but itll give your mind space to recuperate
7495,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42550,77,I have taken Xanax for about years but only as needed There are many years I never took any amp there are years I took it for a few weeks to help with my Anxiety stress of having a child with a deadly disease amp the depression that ensues I usually take the mg amp cut it in half and only use it times a day occasionally halves a day It soothes me amp helps my constantly chattering negative mind take a break I have tried SSRIs amp have symptoms of being allergic to them so cant take them ie muscle twitching rash amp itching So Xanax is my only recourse I know it an be addictive so am very careful to take it only as needed short courses amp usually about half the amount the Dr prescribes It has helped me greatly
7496,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42547,63,I started taking Xanax mg for generalized anxiety over the past few days and it has helped me feel relaxed less worried and happy also hasnt affected me with any crazy side effects Which I was afraid of happening I was so scared to take them but my anxiety was getting out of control so I figured I would give it a try and see how my body handles it Im going to continue taking one a day since it seems to be helping a lot I dont worry and I feel calm the pill does wear off after a few hrs and takes about mins to kick in but my dr says its safe to take another one as needed Im also doing counseling too and it is very helpful as well Definitely recommend this for anxiety
7497,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42543,59,For several years I have been prescribed mg to take up to times per day sometimes I take less some days even none But I find that Xanax does for me what adderall does for children suffering add For some reason the drug helps me have precision focus a clear mind better communication rapid fire thought processing and motivation just for starters I dont expect to take it for the rest of my life but I go thro prolonged periods of anxiety and antisocial behavior will urinate in bottles in my room when at my worst Glad to know there are a few people who Experience the same effects using Xanax as Maintenance Its been a life saver for me Curious to understand why it has this off label effect on us select few
7498,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42543,19,For several years I have been prescribed mg to take up to times per day sometimes I take less some days even none But I find that Xanax does for me what adderall does for children suffering add For some reason the drug helps me have precision focus a clear mind better communication rapid fire thought processing and motivation just for starters I dont expect to take it for the rest of my life but I go thro prolonged periods of anxiety and antisocial behavior will urinate in bottles in my room when at my worst Glad to know there are a few people who Experience the same effects using Xanax as Maintenance Its been a life saver for me Curious to understand why it has this off label effect on us select few
7503,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42519,52,Xanax has really helped me with my anxiety and its not habit forming to me It helps me a lot
7504,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42517,43,I am on a mg dose of xanax on and off for about a year for imsonia night panics and generalized anxienty And I can say this is the best pill Worked great for me It helps me feel calm allday and relaxed during the night so I can get the sleep I need Gives me energy during the day when I drink green tea early morning
7505,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42830,35,I previously said I dont sleep well and it affects my ever vigilant dogs who get up too After surgical menopause when I was years old now hormones and sleep changed I finally was prescribed Xanax to mg at night for sleep Perfect No side effects no abuse Dogs dont follow me at am any more only when time to sleep Thanks
7506,Xanax,Anxiety,1,42829,5,I was prescribed these for an onset of panic attacks that would spike my BP to over Taking these mg pills did nothing but make me lose my short term memory I still felt panicked and my BP would only drop slightly until I rode out the attack
7508,Xanax,Anxiety,2,42815,25,Please try a different benzo before this drug Its a life ruiner The effects are so strong and leave the body quickly it makes you crave more Tolerance builds like crazy with this drug too I suggest klonopin It works great and lasts a lot longer Withdrawal is horrible from Xanax You can die from it Also comes with severe memory loss while taking it
7509,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42810,110,Only med that has ever really worked for me Ive tried every holistic approach to treat my anxiety taking a takes the edge off like nothing else Im afraid to take meds but taking xanax doesnt make me nervous I only take it when my anxiety and panic come back sometimes I have it under control for long periods of time I read a lot of negative things about becoming addicted and the withdrawal effects but most of us who really suffer hate taking meds We rather get better with no drugs It helps me calm down so I can think clearly and get through the day or night Wanted to post something positive for those who are afraid to take it
7510,Xanax,Anxiety,9,42800,38,Doctor had me on Xanax three times a day to try and stop my anxiety depression from furthering While Xanax is wonderful for anxiety be careful the withdrawal can be nasty if you dont get off it properly Needless to say I get timid taking it now cause of that However it helps in times of crisis
7511,Xanax,Anxiety,9,42798,37,Ive been taking xanax for anxiety and its s life saver Works really well always carry a bottle in my purse The only cons are that it can make me sleepy at times and it has an unpleasant aftertaste
7517,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42765,38,Thank you Xanax for the best sleep ever
7518,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42757,23,In a case of emergency I would take Xanax during the day But I usually take it at night to go to bed and to stop the anxiety and panic attacks It makes me feel so sleepy I dont know how anyone can take it during the day I felt high as a kite It works thats for sure
7519,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42751,48,Xanax has been a life saver for me I have been diagnosed with panic disorder and depression since I was a teenager I learned through lots of therapy that my issues are environmental and chemical There are times when meditating and positive affirmations do not work during my attacks This is when I take my Xanax so I can function like a normal human being I do not abuse my Xanax and have been on the same dose mg for the last years There was a time that I was having multiple panic attacks daily for months Xanax helped me stay sane until my psychiatric found the right SSRI for me I think that this drug is great as long as you have a good doctor and use the appropriate amount
7520,Xanax,Anxiety,9,42745,58,I suffer from emetophobiarelated panic attacks and anxiety and this drug is just a godsend I try to reserve it until I really need it as I know that based on my personality I could pretty easily become dependent If it wasnt for the issues with dependency and withdrawal it would be a ten out of ten for meI will note that after I stopped using it semiregularly I became better at dealing with anxiety quoton my ownquot so to speak and experienced less anxiety overall as I improved my coping skills Still Im really grateful for this medication and encourage other miserably anxious people out there to discuss it with their doctors It really improved my life when I thought nothing could
7521,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42743,30,I suffer from complicated grief and PTSD I lost my only child to severe mental illness almost six years ago My anxiety is through the roof right now Psychiatrist prescribed Ativan but it does nothing really MG compared to Alprazolam generic for Xanax Even splitting a MG pill helps me to stop frantic behaviors But this stuff is addictive you have to be careful never to go over prescribed daily dose and I dont know how difficult it will be to stop this medication if I ever decide to do that
7522,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42740,49,I have suffered from anxiety amp panic attacks since Kindergarten I quotself medicatedquotwalcohol amp weed until they became an quotissuequotto say the least I hit rock bottom almost losing my family my jobtried AA Shrinks until I had a full blown attackI thought I was having a heart attack sweatingrapid heart beat etc I also dreaded any social affairsor changes in my life I thought I was just missing a linknot quotnormalquotwhatever that is I went to my Dr amp he prescribed mg the lowest But I was able to functionquot go to weddings NOT drink since Im now on the mg addicted I am able to live wo alcohol amp function but do feel it if I dont take itTrade off Maybebut its better than being a quotcaptivequot of my fears Just be you
7523,Xanax,Anxiety,1,42739,12,I havent seen a xanax in the US from a US pharmacy with the name brand xanax scored on the pill in over years these had no taste Real xanax have a very distinct taste and it never melted in my mouth xanax always melt in my mouth within a few minutes Ive seen videos on youtube of people pressing them My advice is Get a prescription from a doctor and get them from the pharmacy because that wasnt the first time I saw these The streets are flooded with these bars
7526,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42730,21,I have been on a fairly high dose of this medication for over years now I can not tell you enough that it is an extremly horrible idea for long term use times daily or more or even less any long term use of this drug to me is almost a death sentence for that person it is probably the most difficult thing to stay off of if used for more then a month or straight Im trying to get off them now myself but I am so very deep in a hole its almost hard to see the end Once you stop say goodbye to sleep for a while and feeling like complete psychosis for the next few weeks or months till your brain comes back from the hole you dug for it If I could go back and never take a benzo I would in a heart beat ssris and ssnris never worked for me
7527,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42718,68,I have severe social anxiety and have tried every other medicine out there and nothing has worked Xanax so far has changed my life Im able to talk to people and look them in the eye and not feel stupid every where I went I take mg times a day Im just worried about the addiction part Ive heard its pretty bad But I rather be happy all the time than having panic attacks all the time
7528,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42717,73,For years I didnt know I was suffering from Anxiety and Panic Attacks My doctor told me what was happening to me amp prescribed Xanax It helps me TREMENDOUSLY I feel quotnormalquot now Been using it for years
7531,Xanax,Anxiety,5,42717,14,I have been on Xanax since when I was watching my mother slowly suffer I started on mg and eventually the dose was not enough Now ordered mg in morning and mg at night It works however I have cognitive impairment and all I want to do is sleep and my memory is pretty shot I weaned myself down very very slowly and got down to mg daily at night but then some negative events happened and I was going into a panic attack I know this medication works but I would not take it unless it is a must
7532,Xanax,Anxiety,3,42714,30,Xanax does feel like a miracle drug but then addictive drugs always do at st All is fine for someone with anxiety there definitely does seem to be some kind of euphoria because you feel like you can properly have jokes interact socially be yourself again etc Its only a bandaid I know its not an ideal world where everyone can get the best therapies etc but in truth it doesnt work forever and many people such as myself end up with interdose withdrawals and psychological dependence quotOMG I FORGOT TO PACK MY XANAX HOW WILL I COPEquot Compared to the withdrawals I experienced no seizures thank god the anxiety that made me go to the doc in the st place was very minor I would advise use for no more than a month

7553,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42631,37,I deal with an aniexty disorder Where I fear anything that has anything to do with the Apocalypse or other things like bad things in the news or conspiracy theories When I first tried Xanax It blew my mind Before it I wouldnt eat or sleep because I was so worried Now I take it when I need to and it makes me focus on things at hand
7554,Xanax,Depression,10,42629,61,I had always heard the negative jargon of Xanax and was afraid to take it because I was afraid I would be addicted and unable to control it Eventually things were to tough and I was in one of the darkest points of my life So I broke down and talk with my doctor about giving it a try It totally changed my life It helped me to focus more at work It helped manage my anxiety so my mind could rest and I could sleep I could see how this medication could be misused its important to take as prescribed
7557,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42396,7,I have generalized anxiety disorder and several other mental illnesses so I am on a combination of medications Xanax is one of the best of the bunch I only get fifteen mg pills per month for use only in stressful situations Works like a charm every time Within fifteen minutes my anxiety and panic symptoms are well under control No side effects whatsoever I know the danger of addiction is very real but as long as I use my Xanax sparingly I see no reason to ever stop taking it I also take Tenormin Neurontin Ambien Buspar and Remeron
7558,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42385,77,I have been on Xanax for about years now I have suffered with anxiety since I was a child and depression later in life I started out only taking mg a day even going for periods of time without taking it at all and then over the past years I have graduated to only mg a day I feel no need for an increase I suffer with all the usual anxiety symptoms but one symptom that is most annoying is the choking sensation I feel in my throat I believe I carry my stress and worries there When I take Xanax it takes this terrible feeling away I find it extremely difficult to get a doctor to prescribe me this medicine as I moved to another state The people who abuse this drug make it extremely difficult for those of us who need it
7559,Xanax,Anxiety,1,42380,13,Hello everybody Im only giving Xanax a out of because it doesnt seem to have any effect on me Ive been getting it every month for a few years I started it back when after taking Paxil for a decade it started to decrease its effectiveness and my anxiety and panic attacks were beginning to reappear My psych switched me to Effexor and while we were figuring out the best dose in combination with Buspar I was desperate to have a fastacting solution to the panic when I felt it coming on He gave me Xanax but it didnt help with the overwhelming anxiety unless I took a few of them and even then the improvement was minimal to moderate When I found the magic dosage amount with the Effexor my anxiety all but disappeared
7560,Xanax,Depression,9,42380,56,My doctor threw every anti depressant medication my way they ALL made my depression worse to the point I had suicidal thoughts and tendencies My mother had it with the Drs changing my dose and meds so finally she gave me some of her own prescribed xanax She gave me a when I had my bad day about days out of the month now as needed I also have nervous habits anxiety When she started giving me the xanax I was Before I would cry hysterically for hours on end As soon as I tried xanax it all went away No more mood swings my depression went way down only having a few issues a month when I was untreated I am now and I use it maybe times a year and I use oils the others I highly recommend not using it continuously
7562,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42376,21,I started taking Xanax over ten years ago for my anxiety I started with mg twice a day and ended up at mg every hours and still felling like I needed more as I was addicted I had one heck of a time weaning off I now take of a mg tablet every to hours when needed for my tinnitus It works to lessen the anxiety caused by the constant ringing in my ears and I try some days to take it only once or twice It has worked great for me but I suggest being very conservative with your dosing because it is very easy to build a tolerance and form an addiction
7563,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42373,40,I suffer from moderate sometimes severe anxiety General life stress such as my job bad bosses my kids arguing over any amp everything etcIve been on Xanax alprozolam for about years on amp off Recently Ive started experiencing panic attacks with psychotic features selfdiagnosing here and as soon as I take a mg Xanax tablet Im fine within minutes This little tablet has been a lifesaver for me
7564,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42373,49,I have been taking Xanax for about one month now and my life has drastically changed I get really bad hot flashes and when I started taking this I noticed immediate results One huge tip I have is to eat really healthy and also on days where you have time take xanax and go workout hard Run on the treadmill lift weights or swim With all these things incorporated into my life I am much happier have my social life back and I am able to show my natural talents without the fear of doom
7565,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42372,73,If I could give Xanax more stars I would I have Panic Disorder and during college panic disorder with mild Agoraphobia After being prescribed Xanax whenever I felt the onset of a panic attack emerging this medication would save me from spiraling into a cycle of uncontrolled panicMy agoraphobia is gone I would only recommend taking it as needed I couldnt be happier with my results and I can live a normal life knowing I have my security blanket if I need it
7567,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42351,53,All started when I was about years young All typical symptoms racing thoughts palpitations high blood pressure dizzines fear choking feeling chest tightness fear of death and many other unbearable things which happens when anxiety becomes uncontrollable Over the years I have had my good days and my bad days Sometimes to a point where I dont want to live anymore but then comes good days and to live is the thing I want the most For those dark moments when close to panic xanax has really helped me It gets me a bit calmer straight away and then I can start breathing excercise and other little things which help to calm down Without xanax I honestly wouldnt know what to do
7569,Xanax,Anxiety,7,42346,6,Ive been suffering from General Anxiety Disorder for over years I was on Lexapro which was controlling my anxiety wonderfully I was laid of from my job after years working there I then found a new job but because it was change and new I had a massive panicanxiety attack and quit the job after days My psychiatrist then prescribed Xanax along with the Lexapro I was taking mg of Lexapro and mg of Xanax daily the combination has worked for the last years However now I have another new job and had another massive panicanxiety attack The combination of Lexapro and Xanax is no longer working I am now trying mg of Brintellix and mg of Chlonopin Im hoping this works in order to keep my job
7570,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42344,35,Ive always suffer with anxiety but Ive been able to control it Ive been out of work for weeks with a phobia of going back because I had a panic attack amp I was exposed and people were watching My secret was out Rewind weeks ago I had a kidney infection I was in the hospital for days home for days then went directly back to a stressful job Thats where it happened the attack people were surrounding me and causing me more stress I was put back in the hospital Im now on buspar and xanax Buspar I have my negative thoughts on that not sure its helping or not dizzy spells But the Xanax does help with the anxiety It makes me super sleepy and groggy Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist pray me
7572,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42340,62,I am giving it because it simply works and its the best med out there for anxiety Bad thing is its very addictive I have been taking it for almost a year now on and off if I feel very anxious before going to bed Yes withdrawals can be bad but dont listen to all the bad things people say when going off if you need it you take it My mother has been on this med for years as prescribed If you dont abuse it You have no reason to be scared Cheers A
7573,Xanax,Anxiety,4,42335,33,Thankfully I only took this med for a few weeks and at the lowest dose possible I was taking mg times a day for a few weeks until my long term anxiety medication started to kick in This medication truly does help for extreme anxiety and panic attacks but should only be used shortterm The use of this medication for any longer than a month on a daily basis is a recipe for disaster this drug can be very addicting and is really hard to come off after longtime use Luckily I researched this drug and knew this shortly after taking it so I was aware because the doctors never informed me of the risks
7574,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42324,70,Powerful and fast relief from Panic Attacks Ive had to carefully balance benzodiazepines because the higher the dose the more likely Ill suffer withdrawal related rebound effects Right now Im at mg x as needed Ive been as high as mg Less is more Still Ive not found anything as effective as an alternative Xanax just works and fast
7575,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42324,52,I was having difficulty coping after the death of my husband Xanax helped me to put everything into perspective which allowed me to face enormous challenges I rarely ever felt slow from the low dosage only calm
7576,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42324,68,I have been diagnosed with Panic Disorder Hypochondria Illness anxiety Disorder an Eating Disorder and Depression All of the others stemmed mostly from the Panic Disorder I was suffering so much that I could not function and became extremely agoraphobic to where I did not want to leave my room I was scared to take medicine but it got to the point one day where I couldnt take it anymore and decided to give the Xanax my doctor gave me a try It helped so much and I was finally able to calm down enough to think clearly I got on Zoloft and continued taking Xanax until my anxiety and depression was manageable Now I only need it every once in a while when the anxiety and obsessive thoughts get bad Definitely helped me get on my feet
7578,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42318,70,I dont know how to explain the turmoil and suffering that I went through in the mid nineties even after a perfect childhood at years old I found myself pounds in the hospital because I could not eat I could not sleep and I could not function however misdiagnosed as an eating disorder and depression it took me quite a few times to even go to a doctor that noticed I may be a bit nervous I bet that was an understatement Because I keep getting slack about the medication I have tried kalanapin which brought me out like a teenager and did not work for me I have tried valium which was way too strong for me I have been on this medication for over years and have never had to up my dosage not once and it still works
7579,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42318,42,I take quotXanaxquot prescribed by my DoctorNot everyday thoughSometimesFor helping me sleep when my thoughts are going crazy and my imagination is wildIt does help for sleepAddictive if you take it everyday
7580,Xanax,Anxiety,9,42317,44,I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Xanax is the only drug Ive found that works to alleviate the symptoms I take mg no more than twice a week and within minutes I feel calm and relaxed Combine it with yoga and meditation and all your worries are gone I like to take a mg pill and immediately do some yoga and meditate for minutes By the time youre done meditating youll feel great for a couple hours It helps just knowing the pill is there if I want it I actually find that I take it much less than twice a week only or times a month if that I have no other side effects that I notice
7581,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42305,66,Ive been on and off Xanax for years Ive only always took of mg to take the edge off when I felt my anxiety coming on and if I knew I was going to do something out of my comfort zone It has helped me tremendously I concentrate better and it actually helps my stuttering Im a firefighterparamedic and Im constantly dealing with stressful situations I love my job and never could have done it without Xanax I hate that it gets a bad wrap because people abuse it I have never even come close to abusing it and use it for what its for Throughout the years Ive tried all other anti anxiety medications and Xanax is the only one that helped me Its almost like I have a chemical imbalance and Xanax corrects it
7583,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,42301,32,I was put on Xanax twenty years ago to treat anxietypanic I took a small dose four times a day After three years it lost its effectiveness and I chose to go off it Weaning became the single worst experience of my life full of awful experiences I was put on Paxil to treat the absolutely disabling panicanxiety and depression I fell into
7584,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42294,49,Xanax has given me my life back I suffer from severe anxiety a few times a year for no reason Ive been given other Benzos that leave me feeling like a zombie I can take a tiny amount and Im talking of Xanax and it calms me down enough to enjoy life
7585,Xanax,Depression,10,42292,100,Began taking xanax during a time when my one and only child left home for college and I lost my job a month later It allowed me to cope and move forward The most I ever took was mg per day but I now take when I have periodic depression and anxiety I sometimes go weeks without taking one The best way to describe it is like rebooting your mind Life saver for me
7586,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42290,36,I like to think of this as headache medicine Take only when you have one This medicine should be used in emergencies only It is not for taking everyday For that I recommend something that has a longer shelflifethat takes longer to break down like Klonopin Because of Xanax short wait time and short shelflife it can make you feel like an addict If you forget a dose in less than hrs you can experience WORSE symptoms of anxiety because they come without warning or provocation Instant panic attacks inability to think or work etc However as a panic attack reducer or for the instant release of an intense anxietyrelated event I do highly recommend it
7587,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42289,47,Do not use if you have acute anxiety Ive had lifelong daily anxiety and depression that has never gone away I ended up dropping out of school because I couldnt sit still without having a full blown panic attack shaking My head spins all day and my anxiety causes me migraines Ive tried yoga meditation and all natural remedies Ive come to terms with the fact it is genetic I didnt know xanax existed Ive tried all antidepressants and they messed me up pretty bad But I do have a very high tolerance to this medicine I hate that its addicting because its the only thing that makes me feel normal and able to live my life happy
7588,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42288,44,I had anxiety that would tighten my muscles so tensely especially in my jaw my neck my throat and between my shoulders My doctor prescribed me a small dose as needed I wish Id known that this is what I needed I felt such relief my thoughts and muscles relaxed and the next day I felt like a million bucks Im aware that there are some addictive problems for some people happily after that one night of relaxation its like I was freed from a tormenting chamber and I didnt feel need for more I have it on hand and have used it a couple times but have felt nothing of the intense pain Id known before I can think more clearly just from those few nightsdays of relief in the three months Ive had it
7591,Xanax,Panic Disorde,6,42274,44,Ive been taking this medication for a long time yrs I wasnt warned about the memory problems or any way of becoming addicted I can happily say it has helped me I even went into agoraphobia stage Also from my own personal experience Be very careful in taking this medication I actually saw for myself how bad the memory problems can be When I experienced that I went to my Dr an said I wanted ween myself off but slowly not stupid either Ive have been addicted to this medication but u have to realize our brain our mind is powerful than we give it credit for I was using mg times a day Im now down to amp a half times per day Im getting better again
7592,Xanax,Anxiety,5,42265,30,Xanax is amazing In minutes it will completely take away all of your anxiety and or problems and everything will be ok Life goes on The only problem is that Xanax has such a short half life that in hours it goes away and your brain wants more If you take it daily watch out That little pill can ruin your life In prison they will only give meds to people detoxing from alcohol or benzos Bc it can kill you Short term stressful event like flying or giving a speech or a panic attack will do you good Try not taking your Xanax for a few days and see how you feel Or run out of your prescription a few days early Let me sayits not fun Please be responsible and try meditation or working out Stay away from alcoholstims
7593,Xanax,Depression,10,42257,144,Ive been on and off Xanax for years Its the only drug that makes me feel normal after a lifetime of anxiety and depression Its awful that people use it recreationally and thats made it difficult to get a prescription for it because of others abuse of it It makes me feel normal So obviously I need it I have nothing but good things to say about this drug It helps me not want to freak out and shake due to anxiety If you really need to be on it its amazing
7594,Xanax,Anxiety,5,42247,19,I was prescribed this med because I lost my dad very suddenly recently and suffered my first full blown panic anxiety attack The attack itself was the usual numbness and tingling sensation Hard time breathing and impending doom thoughts I was told to take on a as needed basis so thats what I did I started to have the strangest things happening to my body flu like symptoms with hot and cold flashes and pain ALL OVER My usually high blood pressure kept falling and I was dizzy and lightheaded My doctor attributes it to anxiety and directed me to take more So we upped my dose and OMG the pain was worse Now I know I might just be sensitive to this drug but my friend had the exact same experience with it So beware
7595,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42243,56,When Im at my worst or I literally have so many racing thoughts or I get to agitated I take a half or mg smoke tobacco and Im fine its amazing I have not found this drug addictive I only need it when Im thinking or on a anxiety attack Going to a psychiatrist and am hopefully going to be prescribed it it has blessed me and made me think clear thoughts without over thinking Best suited if your diagnosed with adhd anxiety panic attacks
7596,Xanax,Panic Disorde,7,42239,47,Xanax is all too popular for its strong calming effects with rapid onset I do not recommend this as a daily medication at all I in fact advise to use Xanax as least as possible It is one of the hardest drug to kick Abrupt discontinuation call either kill you or make you loose your mind and body Used sparingly for flights funerals etc it is mostly helpful but in a way a succubus of a drug Itll lure you to think its safe fun and calming but it will sooner or later create retrograde anxiety in between doses A halflife of hours is just asking for it
7599,Xanax,Anxiety,1,42236,35,Hello everyone out there reading this I started taking xanax for anxiety a mg bar at night for sleep to turn my brain off at night Worked my way up to mg bars a night for sleepanxiety BRAIN FOG set in MEMORY LOSS like I was going crazy BE CAREFUL this med and all benzos are for short term use ONLY Tried to taper myself off and couldnt I went to a detox facility Hospital and detoxed properly Was a horrible experience I was stuck in a hospital with heroinealcoholics for a week If your reading this BE CAREFUL This med is for short term use
7600,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42217,50,Ive been on this for years Started out on mg daily now Im at mg x daily This truly does help tremendously especially whenhaving a panic attackJust please know that if you try and stop it please see a Dr You get really sick I have never felt that bad in my lifeI felt like I was dying You need to properly tapered off This medicine is great but also has serious mental and physical side effects especially when used for long time periods
7601,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42215,43,Since I have developed an intense fear of flying I stopped flying for yrs altogether In I had a strong desire to start traveling again so I asked my doctor if there was something he could prescribe me so I could sleep and not feel anxious on flights and he prescribed Xanax My fear is so intense is that I have to take mg of Xanaz on a three hour flight in order not to be anxious but it works perfectly Im able to be on the plane and I sleep for a good portion of the flight with no anxiety I do have some memory lasts I often do not remember leaving the airport or much what I do for a few hours afterward but I am able to sleep it off
7602,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42214,61,I live in the UK where it is virtually impossible to get Xanax or any benzodiazepine so I am very lucky to have found a good doctor to prescribe it I am years old and the last years of my life were a living hell I have BPD and a very severe anxiety disorder that left me having multiple daily panic attacks breakdowns and even suicide attempts Every doctor told me in the UK we get talking therapy and an SSRI for anxiety but never benzos So I suffered on for years and years until months ago I found a Dr who prescribed me Xanax Alprazolam mg times a day mg if needed and it is a miracle drug to me For the first time in my life I live without the constant crippling anxiety I HIGHLY recommend this med
7603,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42211,49,I was diagnosed with quot Bilateral Sensorneural Conductive Hearing Lossquot severe nerve damage from the ear to the brain It caused me SEVERE Panic Disorder wAgoraphobia and Major Depressive Disorder My brain is sending me mixed signals We are still working on finding out why or if this nerve causes these disorders they started at the same time I started getting these blarring fog horn sounds in my ears I took my mg xanax about days ago and OMGfor the st time in yrs I slept had no attacks which I had up to x a day no depression little to no mixed brain signals no suicidal thoughts Im starting to get functional no crazy thoughts I even went out of the house and socialized again I still need to be diagnosed though
7605,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42516,65,Man theres nothing to say about xanax that hasnt been said It does its job like nothing else Works perfectly but because of that its super addictive to people prone to anxiety and stress Because its the magic pill that makes it go away That said my experience with it has been mostly good as I have never gone above mg and i try to keep myself at mg daily This is a literal life saver for someone with severe anxiety
7606,Xanax,Depression,5,42513,43,I take mg it makes me calm but also depressed and sad with no energy Mary
7608,Xanax,Depression,7,42505,12,Helps but I have to take it every hours only mg to see any effect
7609,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42500,68,I started having panic attacks about years ago The Dr gave me a few different drugs to try all either had horrible side effects including nightmares or did nothing Then we tried Xanax it was a miracle for me one mg Xanax and I can function again When I was promoted at work to a position where I would have to speak in front of a crowd I was terrified but taking one of these has changed my life
7612,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42466,47,I suffer from anxiety and mood swings much of it is work stress related Xanax has worked wonders for me no habit I have not experience any side effects and I dont believe is habit forming I only take it as needed I always keep them with me just in case I suffer a panic attack I greatly recommend it

7614,Xanax,Anxiety,9,42459,21,I had only taken Xanax a few times as needed and losing it oops Sometimes it works right away with calming me down and everything but this one time I was a mess and it took a while to work But on the bright side I have very bad insomnia and it made me sleep better I do not take it as a sleepy aid that was just one instance where it was night time
7615,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42457,77,Its so great to have something that finally works for me Its fast acting and takes away my insane thoughts and brings me back to reality quickly My worries go away and i can feel like a normal person Ive been on ativan clonazapam And paxil and effexor in my younger days The ativan did nothing The clonazapam was OK but is much better for sleep The paxil and effexor were nightmares and had horrible side effects I would never take that kind of medication again I take mg xanax when I get an attack or intrusive thoughts and its the best thing for me I become a rational thinking person again And couldnt be happier to have something that really works Its really improved my life
7616,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42455,73,I began taking xanax at mg daily spread out over the day when diagnosed with Breast Cancer I have had it times now so have been on this medication for years It controls my anxiety and panic or fearful thoughts mostly Its been extremely helpful and my doctor knows I keep my dosage as directed Very beneficial for me but it took a long while to overcome the stigma Life is to valuable to waste feeling bad
7618,Xanax,Anxiety,5,42446,41,I started taking this medication since I was years old on and off Let me put it in simple terms it is highly addictive Yes it cured my anxiety but temporary only as long as I was on it Miss a day and you want to crwal out of your own skin The withdrawls are horrendous Xanax just masks the problem As soon as I got back on it my brain just wants it and thats all I think about Valarian root is healthier and natural think twice before taking Xanax Go for natural products if you can
7620,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42441,21,I get anxiety attacks with nausea GAD diagnosed and use half a tablet during an attack Im pretty drug sensitive and also leery of overuse Im way under recommended dosage of one full tab every six hours but it takes the edge off my rushing thoughts of worry at half of one every hours as neededI was without anxiety attacks for years and had a very old prescription that I used when my attacks returned FDA has to list an expiration date but of the drug was still active
7621,Xanax,Depression,10,42439,74,I agree with everything that has already been said here I am just so incredibly grateful that I was able to build a trusting relationship with my doctor so that HE feels comfortable prescribing it Xanax really is the only thing that helps me untangle myself when the anxiety takes over What I love the most is that I can count on it to do the job and not leave me feeling strange later It just smooths out the wrinkles and kinks that I get into every so often Just knowing that I have it in my cabinet to lean on is in itself a big help for me my secret tool Yes its a shame something so helpful to us is abused but that is with everything in life Be happy we arent Guinea pigs anymore with the crappy meds
7622,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42439,59,I had horrible anxiety from to then i got prescribed xanax and my life changed i was going out with friends didnt care about little things like what people think of you it was great then at i decided im good i dont need it anymore and had months of hell getting off im mow and ive delt with the anxiety everyday and it got easier but was still a small burdan couldnt be me something was missing i just got back on it a few weeks ago and now ive worked harder then ever i was promoted to asistant manager within weeks of starting back xanax everyone told me how they noticed my confidence in everything and i take control of stressful situations as i work in the food business suddenly im the go to guy at work i work hours aweek
7624,Xanax,Anxiety,6,42430,18,Way too addictive Very expensive in my country and gives me extreme vivid dreamsnightmares But the mellow feeling is nice after a panic attack Stops dead on track panic and almost any emotional crisis But I prefer to stay away I changed to Klonopin
7625,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42426,18,I started out Valium for about years mg x a day Used for anxiety and sleep It worked was a comfort to know most of the time used per day so I always had extra I think knowing I had extras help almost as much Then Dr changed prescription to alprazolam mg tablets times a day some heavy difference at first it worked well In the beginning I felt it minutes after I took it and only needed per day now Im at per day thats mgs and I dont feel it I dont know about withdrawals but I hear its pretty hard to get off and Ive been on them for years Not sure what to expect but think I would feel more alert and energetic too
7627,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42417,34,Having had anxiety since I was a teenager Id been taking no drugs at all and just living with it until I was given valium by my primary doctor and that helped I had seen a CSW a psychologist and finally another psychologist who took me off the valium Id tried and suggested xanax and paxil Ive been taking the two drugs mg paxil x a day and xanax up to x a day for months or so with much success Can these meds be taken indefinitely
7628,Xanax,Anxiety,3,42413,32,Used for weeks to treat muscle spasms and phobia After asking my doctor to wean me off we followed a regimen and it was the worst withdrawal I have ever experienced in my whole life even worse than things that Ive taken in the pastI suffered temporal epileptic seizures for days and was staring at the door for an hour before my girlfriend smacked me to wake me up days later I suffered two consecutive grand mal seizures that broke my skull and noseI had never history of seizures brain MRI EEGs done last year came out clear and crystal and this medicine lowered my threshold so much months after I stopped it I am not the same I am not the same anymore Please be careful and think ten times before you decide to drop it
7629,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42405,27,My psychiatrist prescribes me Xanax mg per month I have generalized anxiety disorder and depression and am on other meds for that Xanax is only for extrastressful situations It is incredibly effective Within minutes of taking it I am much calmer I notice no side effects whatsoever
7630,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42204,35,Truly a miracle pill Starting have severe anxiety attacks out of nowhere heart palpation numbness in arms and legs dizzy tremors and with to mins I feel normal again I would advise to only take when desperately need to because I can see how they can become addictive I take mg but will start to cut that in half a lower dosage is always better if it works I have only been taking for one week so far so good and no side effects to report
7632,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42200,106,Xanax is by far the best anti anxiety medication on the market I take it as needed and it works within minutes I cant stand doctors who talk bad about the medication and how addictive it can be People will aduse anything and every thing Xanax is amazing and I take it as needed not like an addict would
7635,Xanax,Anxiety,2,42184,21,I started this medication after developing a moderateserve anxiety disorder after my grandfather passed unexpectedly I was started on mg to to take twice a day and it had absolutely NO effect on me If anything it made me anxiety symptoms worse and my breathing more shallow amp panicked The only thing the medication was good for was to help me sleep Other than that it did not clear any anxious thoughts or take any of the edge off my anxiety I would not recommend it for constant anxietyanxious thoughts Ive heard its only good for killing quick burst panic attacks Has no affect on long term anxious thoughts
7636,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42168,31,Xanax may have saved my life In the early nineties I was a young man pursuing my ambitions career cars and women Whatever I have done experienced led me to be violent in my reaction to assholes Also mom raised me as she went through menopause and was volatile I was dangerously aggressive in my early s xnx worked with no side affects noticed sleepiness at first thats allI sought xnx because it made me feel like I should calm thus able to focus Did well all these years I got laid off Doc retired and I cant find a local doc to prescribe The system took it away Clandestine alternatives are expensive risking life limb and employment Docs are ignorant sometimes
7637,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42162,27,In I started having what I now know panic attacks but didnt know it at the time my doctor sent my blood in for testing trying to figure out why Im having to pull over when driving cuz I think Im going to pass out due to hyperventilation First I thought I was having low blood sugar but a few weeks later at my follow up appt My doctor said quot youre having major panic attacks I believequot I tried every anxiety medication there is trying to feel betterThen my Dr Gave me mg alpazolam every hours as needed I still take xanex and mg of lexapro to this day Just having a xanex bar in my pocket helps prevent attacks today I get mg bars and I make sure I try to take no xanex a few times a week so I dont become dependent
7638,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42157,67,I started taking xanax when I was fifteen I only take them when I have an anxiety attack and they are the only thing that helps I am now and still only take them as needed They work within a short amount of time amp soothe all symptoms even my muscle spasms
7639,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42157,24,Recently was prescribed Klonopin because my doctor didnt like how Xanax had such a quick onset but also quick fall I was okay with the change initially because even at mg Xanax would make me so sleepy I couldnt function That made it pretty impossible to take during any day panic Ive been have anxiety the last couple days so I took a Klonopin last night hoping that I would wake with a sense of calm like I usually did with the Xanax Nopethe anxiety is actually worse Xanax isnt perfect like I said I generally try not to take it unless I am at home so Ive suffered a lot when I shouldnt have had to but it has a much more calming affect than Klonopin is giving me I never took it longterm only as needed
7640,Xanax,Anxiety,9,42157,27,I only take as needed and it usually works awesome Even knowing i have it as backup reduces my anxiety It works best if taken before a stressful event but having a TBI makes remembering difficult It also works better for me since i dont have to take daily on a schedule like other anxiety medications
7641,Xanax,Anxiety,5,42154,25,Really does help with anxietypanic attacks but has nasty withdrawals I was prescribed mg x a day and whenever I moved my new doctor stopped prescribing me them pretty much forcing me to quit cold turkey Worst month of my life and it only exacerbated my anxiety in the end
7642,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42154,41,Xanax helped me major status When I was years old tried spice its a messed up chemical synthetic THC bull anyways I smoked three bowls and then boom I couldnt breath my hands and muscles tightened up and I couldnt move And my chest felt like I had pounds on it I thought I was dying and my whole body was tingly Went to the hospital and they diagnose with GAD and panic disorder For three months I did not leave my house and I thought I was dying of the time So my doctor put me on Ativan for a month I stopped taking it in days I felt like I was going insane So I was given Xanax for a month The first time taking it BOOM it all stopped I was a normal person it helped me get over all my panic attacks Mg as needed
7644,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42138,122,Its amazing how many symptoms come about because of anxiety chest pain chest squeezing dizziness lightheaded feelings feeling faint sweating nausea heart palpitations I could go on Xanax is practically a miracle drug It stops most of these symptoms cold after about minutes of taking it You feel better and you look back at one hour ago and youre bewildered that stress and anxiety caused you to feel so badly
7645,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42136,78,This medication is a real life saver for aviaphobicsclausterphobics with panic disorder I find mgs prior to boarding an then an additional as needed stops an attack in its tracks This medication coupled with relaxing music on my iPod has given me the ability to conquer the anticipatory anxiety and the panic itself I cannot recommend this medication enough for true panic disorderpanic attacks
7647,Xanax,Anxiety,7,42115,35,This is a qualified positive review for Xanax I was suffering from mild depression and anxiety last winter and my doctor put me on Wellbutrin That stuff takes weeks to work and in the interim it can really up your anxiety level A week later I started mg Xanax Xday and it took care of the anxiety immediately I continued using Xanax for more restful sleep but after about months I realized that short and long term memory was WAY down Stopped Xanax and replaced with GABA and this seems to be a far better solution The Wellbutrin worked great felt more energy the first week but did take weeks to fully kick in I will now ONLY take the Xanax for rare severe stress Also check the connection to Alzheimers
7648,Xanax,Anxiety,10,42110,91,Xanax made me a normal person again I had bouts of anxiety seemingly my entire life but it didnt become debilitating until I reached my s and became overwhelmed with everything on my plate and I lost sight of who I was I couldnt focus on anything because I was too worried about school and work and my health issues It became too much and I dropped out of school with a Anxiety stole my life away but Xanax gave me the strength to gain it back Im finally about to graduate have a wonderful job and just recently got engaged I am a normal person and I thank anxiety for calming my brain and enabling me to live a beautiful productive life I highly recommend it if you genuinely suffer from debilitating anxiety
7649,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,42109,45,I had the worst anxiety imaginable that manifested to agoraphobia and I was a prisoner for years Its a long story but Xanax saved my life or rather gave me my life back In any event those that suffer daily anxiety or GAD general anxiety disorder are better off using an MOA inhibitor as a maintenance medication and Xanax as an emergency medication Im on effexor daily Mg that took about weeks to start working but when it did is too was a miracle I did have side effects when I started but my doctor told me to quothang in therequot because the side effects are usually just temporary and they were with the exception of weight gain in which I control with exercise and diet which gave me another side effect better health
7650,Xanax,Depression,1,42105,62,If you cut back on the dosage you risk the chance of having seizures even taking as prescribed over a long period of time because of the tolerance buildup I have been in rehab times trying to get off of xanax They give you valium librium or ativan so you donrsquot have a seizure and then lower that dosage over days and release you But days later your symptoms are going to be so bad it will drive you back to xanax which now you will probably have to buy on the street because theyrsquore widely available unlike valium
7651,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,42101,55,Im tried other antianxiety meds but Xanax is the only one that keeps my panic disorder in check and Im had several others prescribed that were no effective I take mg Xdaily
7653,Xanax,Anxiety,9,42082,72,I have had anxiety since I was a child from my personal experiences this medicine is the fastest and effective but BE VERY CAREFUL also the most depending I ran my prescription short one month and was without for a couple of days and had a seizure while driving Just because the doctor says three or four times a day doesnt mean you need them that much BE VERY CAREFUL
7654,Xanax,Anxiety,8,42078,26,I started having anxiety attacks a few months ago due to marijuana use Bad life choice I regret but due to my natural anxiety marijuana made it x worse I started having anxiety attacks sometimes up to x a day for a few weeks I had a visit to my doctor scheduled anyway and was honest and told him about my situation He prescribed me xanax to use as a short term medication for my anxiety attacks as he said weed can cause horrible anxiety for a month in some ppl I took it as prescribed which was every six hours as needed I started with about mg a day but took a few times when it was real bad weeks later I began splitting the pills in half to Am completely off it now but made a huge difference in my life for that time
7655,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41929,89,Been taking it for years and it gets me through anxiety attacks
7656,Xanax,Depression,10,41919,98,I was prescribed Xanax because my half brother died and I could not cope with it alone on just taking Pristiq for depression Taking both of these medicines has really reduced my depression tremendously to where it only affects me a little now and not so many days in a row Id really like to stay on Xanax with my other antidepressant medication Pristiq mg because its helping a lot
7658,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,41900,120,Just got prescribed mg of Xanax Within a half hour the intrusive thoughts and panic attacks stopped Taking sparingly only when needed Definitely a good thing to take at your worst moments but not good for regular use
7659,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,41885,77,I have panic disorder and Xanax has helped me greatly The only problem that I have experienced is that I have become resistant to it Rather than mg helping I need to take to calm down My doctor only allows me mg pills per month so Im petrified that at some point I am going to have an attack after I have run out of meds
7660,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41871,123,I have been on quite a few antidepressants in addition to Xanax The antidepressants made my anxiety and panic worse needing to increase my intake of Xanax when on the antidepressants I was really reluctant to take the Xanax when I was first prescribed the medication I have been of Pristiq for months now and have lowered my Xanax from mg in the morning mg midday and mg at bed I am now taking mg in the morning and mg at bed I am taking vitamins doing yoga and taking better care of myself My doctor knows I am honest He wanted me to take mg every hours but never did My Mother just died a few weeks ago and have been getting really bad anxiety and still the same dose helps me Hope this helps
7662,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41853,140,After a recent medical diagnosis I had a difficult time coping and felt a tremendous sense of fear and worry constantly Brought me to the point I was physically ill everyday and having panic attacks frequently Xanax is wonderful when you find the right dose Too much and I became a zombie MG was my perfect dose It brought me down from panic and allowed me to take a step back and deal with my problems rationally
7664,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41846,88,I was in England when I started getting feeling of depersonalization forehead pressure fear negative thoughts and irritation etc I came back to my country and consulted a doctor He diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder What he prescribed me may have worked but honestly speaking I did not give fair chance to the prescribed medicine He did not prescribe me Xanax but I managed to get it from somewhere myself as I had read about its effectiveness against anxiety It worked perfectly for me I killed my anxiety with it It normalizes me and keeps me going ahead in life I give
7665,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41831,68,I thought this medicine might help with the onset of an atrial fibrillation attack and it does Not a guarantee but very often helps especially at night when I feel something coming onit allows me to fall into a deeper sleep which at times kicks the onset Also very useful for anxiousness as documented I do not take it daily only when needed
7666,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41828,63,I take mg three times a day for panic attacks I wish I could say Xanax stops the panic attacks completely but it only lessons the symptoms until I feel okay enough to calm myself down with breathing exercises Other than that Xanax is a miracle
7667,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41824,85,I get intense panic attacks Xanax is very effective at working quickly to stop a panic attack It saved my life until after a few months I tried to stop taking it and got horrible withdrawals I felt like I was dying my anxiety was worse than it had ever been in my life high blood pressure and mine is naturally low tachycardia hallucinations tremors I hope anyone considering taking Xanax takes it at a low dose and not daily If daily do not quit cold turkey
7669,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41766,171,This medication has helped me live a normal life well more normal I dont worry much about nothing and I can go into Walmart and feel comfortable My social life is improving as well There were times I couldnt get myself to interact with people sometimes I wouldnt even answer the phone Ive only been on this medicine for a little over a month it has truly been a lifesaver I am sleeping like a baby I cant remember the last time Ive struggled to calm down and go to sleep only to wake up several times a night using the bathroom or just couldnt relax My quality of life is getting much better
7671,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41746,100,I have experienced anxiety since being diagnosed with Cancer years ago I use MGs twice daily and stick to this dosage given to me by my doctor It helps me tremendously I have tried to step off it several times and found it very difficult Will remain on it for as long as I need it It improves my life quality and keeps panic and anxiety at bay
7672,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41743,143,Yeah it worksSome people are more sensitive than others Generally you take a pill depends on dosage and you just start feeling your tight chest and stomach release and I notice I begin breathing more calmly and normally Just feels good all over which is such a contrast from the horrors of anxietyIt can make you a little sleepy I think for normal people it would make them very sleepy For anxious people I think it makes you normal and relaxedThe one problem is that if you take it too much like three days in a row the effect is reduced and you have to up the dosage I think it works best for occasional use like before a difficult situation or when youre just having a lot of anxiety and need calm
7673,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41738,45,Extremely helpful
7674,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41731,56,This works effectively for anxiety as well as sleeping problems It doesnt impair my cognitive abilities It is not addictive to me however the only problem is getting off Xanax and the backlash effect it creates I have successfully used Tranxene to bridge this gap and taper off safely I rate it a it has been a true miracle when I needed it most

7677,Xanax,Anxiety,8,41715,85,I should start by letting you know that I was an addict of medicines and having been through treatment now enjoy years and months of sobriety but I am also a sufferer of a wretched case of anxiety complete with full blown crippling panic attacks Which I have suffered from for many years but upon completing treatment for my recreational use and now being honest with doctors it was very difficult for that reason to get one to prescribe something that would help my condition When I found one that would I would have to have my wife allocate the Xanax out to me but I will say it has helped and worked wonders IN MODERATION

7694,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41986,74,Takes away all anxiety and stress I have GAD SAD and PTSD
7695,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41985,94,Works very well for anxiety The best way to take these types of medicines is to take them as needed Some doctors will tell you to take them everyday as prescribed but I found in my years of experience with Xanax that taking them everyday is an easy way for it to become habit forming and addictive When I take them as needed I dont become dependent on them I think doctors disagree with this method because they feel that you need to counter the anxiety before you get it and that way you can learn to tolerate it I have tried using Xanax both ways its nice not having anxiety but your body and mind will adapt to the dosage and if you take it long enough you will find you need a higher dose to feel like you did
7696,Xanax,Anxiety,5,41978,44,I noticed my memory was very much affected on Xanax This is the quickest working benzo in my opinion but does not last long Also the withdrawals from Xanax were more severe than the withdrawals from the other benzos Ive been on It works great for some people but not so much for me
7697,Xanax,Anxiety,8,41974,44,Acts very quickly and definitely feel the calming effect The only downsides is that it doesnt last very long hrs max maybe even less and you quickly build up a tolerance for it so you end up having to take much more the more you use it

7722,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41457,48,Xanax is amazing In I was overwhelmed with emotions My mother had a stroke in March of that year and at the same time me and my wife were expecting our st child All these emotions led to me having depression and anxiety I was finally diagnosed in with anxiety disorderpanic attacks They prescribed me Xanax mg one a day and it works miracles in my daily life
7725,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41438,35,I take it as needed
7726,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41433,90,I have found that Xanax works for me in such a way that I can go outside to the shopping mall and to other events with my family that I would otherwise avoid at all costs I have been on Xanax since and aside from a couple of small self medicating and using with alcohol when I was younger I no longer do these things which are quite dangerous and my life has been almost normal
7727,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41420,67,This is an absolutely wonderful medication Xanax along with mg of Prozac has given me my life back No more insane panic attacks and no more not being able to sleep Take no more than what the doctor says to take in one day
7729,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41408,66,God send
7730,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41687,132,Ive been on a variety of different benzodiazipines for about years now for anxiety Agorphobia and even insomnia and I have to say Xanax is by far the most effective Ive been on Valium Klonopin Ativan and even SSRIS and none helped me the way Xanax did Ativan did absolutely nothing Valium was quotdecentquotId give it a because of its long acting qualities and Klonopin made me tired all the time Only with Xanax can I lead a normal productive life Without that medicine I would not be able to hang out with friends go to the grocery store go to the mailbox associate with my family these are all triggers of my anxiety Even answering the phone Ive taken mgs two times daily now for the past years and it works great
7731,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41686,86,I have always struggled with worry stress and anxiety and recently have gone through some really difficult situation My doctor diagnosed me with panic attacks and prescribed me a low dose of Xanax to take when needed I take half a pill because I am afraid of developing a habit and hate relying on medications This really does work and helps me a lot I have only needed it a few times
7732,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41685,46,I have anxiety for a long time taking Zoloft for it since not sure how much it helps but when I get really bad I take Xanax mg it does help quickly My only thing on Xanax I wished that it wouldnt be habit forming and because of that you may need to make dosage higher and higher after mg Also recommend checking for interactions with Xanax if you are taking any other medicines
7733,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41682,34,I asked my doctor if he could give me something as I had been under stress and anxiety for some time I take mg of Xanax twice a day I take it about hour before I go to bed so I can relax and sleepNot sure if the Xanax is causing some weight gain or not
7734,Xanax,Panic Disorde,6,41675,76,I have been on Xanax for about months after a very difficult period in my life Xanax helped me very well in the beginning of threatment but quickly tends to lose its beneficial effects The development of tolerance is a major issue with all benzodiazepines and seems to build fast with Xanax alprazolam I had to increase my dose from mg twice a day to mg three times a day Tapering off can be difficult
7735,Xanax,Tinnitus,10,41673,131,Lifesaving Was completely nonfunctional before being put on it I understand the risks but the risks of disabling tinnitus were million times worse This medicine needs to be studied further as I also agree that severe tinnitus related to sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a brain condition I tried a million things beforehand steroids steroids injected into ear hyperbaric oxygen etc Xanax saved my life
7736,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41667,123,I had a breakdown in my doctors office after my Klonopin stopped working She said I needed something stronger for my daily panic attacks as I could not even function at my part time job that was only three days a week I am on mgs twice daily Its affordable and helps like no other medicine Ive tried I take it with chamomile tea to relax if Ive had a stressful day Or if things get too hectic at work I may take half of one It also cured my insomnia I feel like a normal person now
7737,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,41658,68,This is only what helps me
7738,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41643,153,As far back as I can remember kindergarten I think Ive suffered from major anxiety issues I can remember throwing up in the trash can by the entrance to Jr High School and through High School even I could then and can now make my hands sweat just by thinking about it When I finally got on Xanax I was far more outgoing funny and learned there was a whole side to me I didnt really know existed due to Anxiety My point isdont wait Talk to some one who can help you with Anxiety if you have it And BE HONEST Tell them how hard it is for you
7739,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41641,40,I started taking Xanax in my daily dose was up to mg daily as needed I finally felt that I had my life back In we moved to AZ and the st Dr I saw here discontinued it cold turkey A few others were drastically cut back and stopped without any warning I must say it has been difficult
7741,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41605,119,Between being at terrorist attacks Madrid and the st Trade center I have had severe panic attack and depression Xanax is a great cure for the craziest things that life throws at you
7742,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41604,66,Xanax was a Godsend in the short term Nearly immediate peace from all anxiety and panic symptoms The longer I took it though the more problematic it became Constantly increasing dose for effectiveness switching formulations Finally addiction dependence didnt matter if it was called this or that Discontinuing Xanax was painful Like weeks long restless climbing the walls no sleep Id still call it useful in a low dose well supervised situation
7743,Xanax,Depression,10,41599,179,Very good for insomnia and stress which leads to depression No side effects
7746,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41565,59,Out of all the benzodiazepines I think that Xanax alprazolam is the best for me acts quick amp does what it says just be careful amp if you are going to ask your Dr For them I recommend maybe starting out a smaller dose and work up from there If that doesnt work the reason is after a bit you get a little immune to strength amp can bump up in dosage if this happens unless you have a high tolerance then maybe start at mg that way you can still move up if that doesnt work but I recommend starting small amp moving up in dosage if needed
7748,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41557,93,Xanax nullifies panic attacks within minutes This is one of the best medications to treat panic disorder It works fast but also wears off fast Its good for acute anxiety
7749,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41550,89,I started out on Valium mg times a day when I was due to petitmal seizures The doctors said my anxiety was causing my blood pressure to go out the roof At age had a heart attack due to anxiety making my BP so high I was in V fib Now at age Im taking Xanax mg times a day For me all the antidepressants cause some kind of stimulation hat makes my anxiety worsen so I stopped the SSRIs It is working for now but I fear what happens when this doesnt work anymore what am I going to do So tired of having anxiety and panic disorder I dont think too many doctors understand what a profound problem this causes in ones life So really express how you really feel to your Doc
7750,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41547,84,Ive had panic attacks for over years I do not know what triggers them I dont know when theyre going to occur but they do on a daily basis The only medication that I ever had that truly worked was Xanax This is the true panic disorder medication and should not be taken lightly because your body does become accustomed to it Example after using it for a year I noticed I needed to increase my medication I went from mg milligrams mg milligrams every to hours Use wisely
7752,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41541,44,I have had a very emotional ups and downs in life and after getting married years ago my life became more hectic years ago when I lost my cousin I had panic attacks and I became hypochondriac I took AnxitXanax to mg twice a day I stopped all of a sudden after an year and did not notice withdrawal symptoms as depression was somewhat like part of life dealing with people Now recently I started having very bad panic attacks and I almost stopped going out alone as I was scared to go out alone and my panic was of heart attacks and death by sudden reasons etc for the past week I again started taking Anxit mg once in morning and night I am fine and happy for the past week and I want to continue same dose
7757,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40890,15,As soon as I started taking Xanax I started to feel much better I have had anxiety and panic attacks for years and Xanax has really helped me I have had zero side effect from taking it So far going well
7758,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40888,7,I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder so Xanax has served as my quotsafety netquot in times of distress When taken as prescribed those of us who need it simply feel like life is bearable again Those nagging irrational thought patterns and worries are silencedHowever Xanax is not a medicine to be taken lightly hence the bad reputation its received Its short halflife causes cravings to redose vs Klonopin which never gives me those feelings Use in moderation and make an effort to see a cognitivebehavioral therapist if you havent done so
7759,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40888,20,This treatment completely stopped my panic attacks which I thought could never be controlled Just take when you get up to guarantee a peaceful day I tried all the antidepressants from Depakote to lithium they all had some weird side effect
7760,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40886,9,I was in a car accident a few years ago After that I had a panic attack when I would have to ride in a car My doctor prescribed me mg whenever I had to ride and it helped great Now my doctor relocated and no other doctors will prescribe it It causes problems between me and my wife

7763,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40881,11,They work so good for me I dont know what I would do without it
7766,Xanax,Depression,9,40872,55,Xanax is so great for me because I selfinjure It gives me the rational stance in my head when I feel like cutting myself It doesnt allow me the energy to get so angry at myself You just have to remember to actually take it when you feel your attack coming on and have patience for it to kick in This is the best benzodiazepine because it works the fastest Ativan is good sometimes I saw trails but Xanax being the fastest but Klonopin lasts the longest

7772,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40848,13,I have been taking Xanax for years This pill has done wonders for me It really did give me control of my life back I was prescribed mg I was afraid to take it at first because of all the stories I have heard about addiction Well when I first tried it it was an immediate success and I knew I found the key to living the rest of my life normally My doctor didnt just throw this at me This was our last option It was the best oneI do get dizzy sometimes I also experienced weight gain That was mainly because as I started to live normally again I stopped working out and other methods that I used to help combat panic That was mainly a healthier life style that I assumed would naturally help me think clear
7775,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40840,11,I feel like Xanax saved me I had a very rough childhood with my father addicted to drugs lost our house had to raise my sisters because my mom had to get a full time job I was going down a very bumpy road I finally settled down with my now soon to be husband and with the persuasion of him and my father now sober and also has anxiety At age I finally broke down and decided to go talk to a doctor He prescribed me to multiple antidepressants that made everything worse He then put me on Xanax Ive never been so stress free I have held down the same job Im doing well in school and again and maintained a healthy relationship Im a changed person at years old

7779,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40830,7,I suffer from anxiety and was prescribed Cymbalta and Xanax While they both worked I didnt like the way Cymbalta made me feel and I had some of the more alarming sideeffects so Ive switched over to just taking Xanax as needed and going to a psychotherapist and I feel much much more in control of my anxiety I only take mg as needed when I feel my anxiety building and find it to be perfect I can calm myself down more quickly and still focus and work productively
7780,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40828,10,Xanax is something that I was afraid to take given the fact that people with anxiety and panic attacks are usually scared of what the medicine is going to do I finally gave in and started taking my Xanax on a day when I needed to go to the Doctor which terrifies me I took the lowest dose mg and I am so thankful that I did No panic whatsoever at the Doctors office I so look forward to knowing that I will have something to take to help me get through panic situations that I have been avoiding for years

7804,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40693,10,This medicine is a lifesaver Before I began taking Xanax the suffering I endured was indescribable I panicked when I rode on trains or buses I almost went out of my mind if a train stopped or slowed down between stations and I could not get off I felt trapped During a job interview I suffered such a severe panic attack that I wanted to flee into the street My doctor prescribed Xanax and I was able to start and continue to work Otherwise I would have committed suicide Fortunately I get a generous supply each month which I use upIve heard horror stories from people whose doctors will not prescribe benzodiazepines at all Also some states place unnecessary red tape on Xanax prescriptions
7806,Xanax,Anxiety,8,40497,16,Ive tried many other nonaddictive medications and none of them helped my anxiety the way Xanax does After several other medications and hesitation on my part my doctor finally prescribed me Xanax mg times daily depending on my level of anxiety that day I ended up breaking most of the pills in half and only taking mg usually x a day and find it relieves my anxiety without the level of sleepiness a whole mg gives me I usually only take a whole pill if I feel a panic attack coming on But Ill take the mild drowsiness any day over the level of constant anxiety I had prior to starting the drug and a couple cups of coffee usually does me good I can definitely tell when a dose starts to wear off though some withdrawal

7811,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40442,187,Excellent for anxiety especially if you start with the minimum amount mg and only take more if needed I say this because I was prescribed mg x daily and dont need that much Try to take the least amount and if that works dont take more since you can build up a slight tolerance over time My only concern is will I ever be able to be off of medicine I just wish there was a natural cure for anxiety I hate being dependent on this
7813,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40424,20,My doctor prescribed medication for depression I have tried three different kinds and had terrible side effects I am taking Xanax occasionally when anxiety or panic occur and it works for me just great Generic version alprazolam takes a little longer to kick in

7819,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,40401,82,There is such a misconception about Xanax with people thinking you will be addicted forever if you use it When this medicine is used the right way it can be life changing Every drug can be abused even over the counter medicines I can relax just knowing I have my Xanax

7824,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40332,19,Amazing for anxiety and panic disorders but another wonderful thing about Xanax is it will even help take the edge off of the common cold and the flu I have carpal tunnel arthritis and osteoporosis an it helps relax the joints and muscles just enough to get a good nights sleep A quotwonder drugquot It does have some major downfalls also like longterm deppendency

7833,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41368,40,Ive been on alprazolam for a couple years now Im now on mg times a day but only take as needed It has been a life saver for me But now my doctor has prescribed me Viibryd mg and I have been on every antidepressant you can think of and has not been a good experience
7834,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41367,53,Xanax is a lifesaver for me I am years old diagnosed with Panic Disorder with agoraphobia Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Depression It all started when I was about or years old To make a long story short every other medicine I took either didnt work or made me gain a ton of weight SSRIs I am currently weaning myself off of Zoloft from mgs since it doesnt seem to be working any more down to mgs at the moment I plan on just taking Xanax alone when Im off of the Zoloft It is the ONLY medicine that relieves ALL of my symptoms I will see my doc tomorrow to discuss what dosage I should take after going off of Zoloft completely because I do take both right now Im just tired of being fat from all these SSRIs
7837,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41335,61,Relaxed and calm
7838,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41330,60,Xanax has been a life saver Just recently had a heart attack and had my th stent put in Was still having chest pains which obviously scare me when I have them The tricky part is separating the chest pains from anxiety which I have been diagnosed with What a vicious cycle
7839,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41328,98,I was years old when my family doctor prescribed me Xanax mg for my stress and anxiety from work and life at the time Im now I only take it when Im under a lot of stress or when my anxiety level goes up in any situation in my life At the same time when Im stressed out I go walking and running because it helps too I wouldnt know what I would do if I didnt have Xanax to help me
7841,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,41325,116,Ive tried Prozac Zoloft Celexa and many more antidepresents and none of them worked for my severe anxiety social anxiety panic attacks and post traumatic stress disorder I struggle with Panic attacks on a daily basis but Xanax has helped me so much and Ive come a long way Panic attacks are one of the worsts conditions to have
7842,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41302,69,years ago I had my first panic attackanxiety Had hyperventilation and end up in the ER My doctor prescribed mg of Xanax I took the medicine as required I wasnt able to drive and do anything out by myself I was afraid and worried of being alone I always fear that it would happen again My thoughts are always what ifAnxiety was taking over my life I was able to control it for years Just this month I recently panicked for no reason My dr put me on this just in case I have a full blown anxietybut the downside to this medicine is it makes me really sleepy and tired But it does works
7843,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41302,112,I have taken Xanax on and off for years and I would say it has been a lifesaver for me I have episodes of anxiety nothing earth shattering but debilitating nontheless Xanax has helped smooth those times over and make life manageable This is a wonderful medicine
7844,Xanax,Tinnitus,9,41295,110,Tinnitus very loud and lasts all day and night Couldnt sleep until I used Xanax and it worked great
7845,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41291,98,Excellent It helps my anxiety tremendously and takes care of my panic attacks promptly I highly recommend it If you take it as prescribed you will not get addicted I have been taking it for ten years It also helps with my high blood pressure and tachycardia
7846,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41290,56,Great for panic disorder
7848,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41278,77,I suffer from anxiety panic attacks as well as live a somewhat stressful life style Xanax has been my life saver and has been a tremendous aide in allowing me to continue to function in life on a daily basis Truly a blessing in my life
7850,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41250,102,I thank Xanax for making me a better mom I was mean to everyone around me and I took the motto quotthis is who I amquot to heart It was not until my mother died after having my third child that I actually realized my angry childhood and anger in this world was not to blame on any one but my own feelings After taking Xanax and some therapy I am a new person I would not be able to live without it I do not abuse it I only take the amount prescribed by my doctor and no more I also take Paxil which helped me a lot as well but without the Xanax I would not be living Participating with my life and most of all my children I read to them now we go on picnics and wilderness hikes I love my life now
7851,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41249,23,Good
7853,Xanax,Depression,10,41243,114,I am prescribed MG Tablets a month brand name I take a half times a day and am also prescribed mg Klonopin a month morning afternoon and nightWhile the Klonopin seems to aid in keeping the panicanxiety at bay and keeping me calm and relaxed the Xanax is the real punch to panic attacks and anxiety it takes all my sadness and depression away and allows me to think about all the amazing things I am working on NOT as a chore or as work but as creative idea Being prescribed Benzos is odd practice like Klonopin times a day with a fast acting Xanax
7854,Xanax,Anxiety,8,41241,5,A God send for my untreatable insomnia Only side effect that prevents me from taking it more often is the testosterone suppressing effect I spend a lot of time working out and eating right and noticed my strength and body composition took a very noticeable nose dive a few months after starting on it I have used mg nightly for almost a year On the plus side it has helped me get the deep restorative sleep I struggle to get
7856,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40683,11,I have been on Xanax for a few years for anxiety and panic attacks and have found Xanax to be very helpful and not as addictive as many other medications
7858,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40680,24,Xanax has been an extremely effective medication I have severe panic with agoraphobia and failed to respond to therapy clonazepam paroxetine other benzodiazepines antidepressants AEDs betablockers and others I have taken up to mgday but I find that mgday is best Side effects are nonexistent nor have I ever experienced any form of withdrawal Incidentally Xanax along with imipramine have been shown to be effective for years of continuous use Great for either shortterm use and if needed longterm use
7859,Xanax,Anxiety,8,40678,7,Xanax Alprazolam is a good drug for anxiety and panic disorder is wonderful while youre taking it But I know to leave this medicine is so painful and has many unpleasant effects on the withdrawal It works great for me
7860,Xanax,Anxiety,6,40672,14,I started taking Xanax at age and it was a great medicine I had such bad panic attacks and just constant anxiety I started out on a low dose and within mins I felt calm and fine I got from the place of not being able to walk outside or answer the phone to being able to get married have a job go on vacations Anything I wanted to do I WAS NORMAL But now Im and on the highest dose mg a day and about years ago my horrible anxiety came back even though Im taking it I cant work drive or really go anywhere anymore So I guess Id say it works but then you may build up a tolerance and then it wont work
7861,Xanax,Anxiety,2,40668,17,I was taking mg of Xanax almost daily for about a year I tried to quit cold turkey by being off of them for about days straight and when day hit me I thought I was going to die I couldnt sleep for the days I didnt have it constant pacing around the house twitches like crazy and had to get some ASAP as I was out It has been over a month now and I am slowly coming off of the Xanax I am down to about mg every days or so and I havent had any additional medications It can be done but you have to prepare yourself for it mentally and tell yourself you CAN do it I have quit in the past and regret ever picking up the bottle again
7862,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40663,8,Xanax is an excellent medicine for myself It has prevented panic attacks and helped me through times of rough anxiety Ativan never worked for me and Klonopin makes me drunklike and put me in the hospital times The hospital finally said I have an allergy to Klonopin and could no longer take it After going on Xanax I felt so much better and relieved I try not to take Xanax everyday as it is not meant to be a longterm solution to anxiety and can be very addicting so be very careful I am on Paxil CR and Risperdal on top of Xanax for my anxiety PTSD panic disorder and OCD
7863,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40630,6,Xanax has really helped me relax I have severe anxiety depression and PTSD I take Seroquel XR and recently my doctor switched me from Xanax to Atarax The Atarax did not work at all I have suffered from anxiety for years and the only thing that has been effective is Xanax I would recommend this to anyone who has moderate to severe anxiety It does have a high addiction rate so be extremely careful when taking this
7866,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40610,7,I typically dislike and try to avoid taking medications whenever possible but with a recent anxiety diagnosis I was convinced to at least keep some of this on hand in case I need it I must say that I LOVE Xanax It really calms me down within about minutes of taking it and helps me sleep almost irrespective of what is going on but it doesnt leave a hangover effect the next morning Im currently in the phase of trying to find a more quotregularquot medication to control my anxietyOCD currently trying venlafaxine as the Xanax isnt meant to be a daily thing In the meantime Im still using this when I feel I need it Ativan and Valium dont compare
7869,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40608,15,With the death of my mom in June I immediately started having nausea and vomiting couldnt eat couldnt concentrate I thought I was dying myself Every time I tried to go to sleep I could feel my heart beating furiously through my chest I wanted to die myself My Doctor finally prescribed Xanax after a horrible episode of just trying to drive home from his office I had to stop about times because I was crying so bad He said I was suffering from PTSD Without Xanax I do not think I would have been able to handle all the legal paperwork that I had to do plus work Now in we had to close our business and have lost my job The whole episode has started up again I hope the increased dose will help and I can continue my life
7870,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40582,18,I think that this is one of the best medicines out there I take mg four times a day and it just seems to keep me calm and make the world a better place I used to stress out about the smallest things now I just go with the flow
7871,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40581,10,I have chronic interstitial cystitis not sure on spelling also called painful bladder syndrome It is like a urinary tract infection times I have to go to bathroom any where from every minutes up to times every hours So it can be a problem if Im away from home If I take my Xanax mg I usually dont have to go to bathroom but once every or hrs and since it hurts so bad to urinate and plus I can get sleep at night with not having to go every hour It has been such a relief I rate it a My doctor has it written or every hours as needed but I try to only take it at night Im very cautious
7872,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40577,8,My anxiety is so much under control now
7874,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40568,10,I was prescribed this medication in the hospital after suffering severe anxiety attacks I was only given a couple to get me through until I see my doctor but I found out the doctors are unwilling to give you this medication I have anxiety attacks everyday but this medication makes me stay calm so I dont suffer from these awful anxiety attacks I feel relief and that I can go on
7875,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40561,8,I think its a great medicine but I only take it as needed since its so fast acting
7878,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,40504,7,Was better than Ativan by far but just doesnt last long enough
7879,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40503,35,I have tried many medications for panic disorder I dont think there was not tablet I have not tried when I was prescribed Xanax I felt I was given my life back No horrible side effects of anxiety or panic disorder whatsoever I can now function without worrying if I went out I would have a panic attack or drop whatever I was doing and go home as I felt like I was dying My heart would race my breathing felt like I was taking my last breathe excessive sweating They all went away I take mg when needed and have never abused this medication but it has been a life saver for me It took years to find a tablet that would stop my panic and anxiety disorder and then I tried Xanax from my doctor and I thank her everyday
7880,Xanax,Anxiety,9,41009,22,I used to work for a bank and I was being helped by one of my colleagues on opening an account for a customer I was making many mistakes I began to panic and I was sweating profusely The customers wouldnt make much conversation with me because they felt they were making me nervous I had to excuse myself to take a breather in the break room Xanax has helped me become more relaxed and socially open with strangers I feel like my job interviews are going to be pleasant now The only side effect I experience is tiredness after the medicine wears out but that only lasted for about hour for me
7881,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40995,21,When the world is closing in on me I take a Xanax and suddenly Im able to function again I can learn and adapt and I feel like I can capture and retain information better Without it any new information is lost on me and my learning process is inhibited The little stuff is not a problem anymore and I can focus on accomplishing anything I need to I didnt start having anxiety attacks until after college I did really well and all of a sudden I felt like in the real world I could not meet the expectations because of how well I did in school Everything became too much Debt learning a new job reading which is my favorite thing to do being with family and friends I hit a wall Even with antidepressants I could not function
7883,Xanax,Anxiety,8,40994,13,Xanax is great It gets rid of anxiety but makes me drowsy
7884,Xanax,Anxiety,7,40989,18,It helps me from having severe anxiety attacks I do go through normal emotions so I only take them when I get too overwhelmed and I am going to have an anxiety attack They are very helpful
7886,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40975,10,Helps me a lot
7891,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40953,42,Amazing Helps so much with my panic attacks It works almost instantly which is just what I need By the time Xanax kicks in the worst of my panic attack has lessened This medicine allows me to quickly nip the attack in the bud and allow me to function normally It does taste terrible but is worth it Great medicine Fast working and effective What more could you ask for
7895,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40930,12,It kicks in fast when you get that real bad feeling but Im tired of taking pills everyday and it happenes everyday a few times a day bad body aches breathing chest pains I dont even worry about anything and boom it creeps up on me fast

7899,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40911,16,I suffer from panic attacks that occur after I go to sleep I wake up about an hour or so after I fall asleep I dont have trouble falling asleep freaking out My heart is racing I am terrified and I feel like I will go crazy before it stops They are so scary because no matter how many times I have suffered through them I am always sure I am dying when I have one Previously I was given other medications like Buspar or Paxil but I didnt tolerate them very well and they did not stop the attacks only slowed them down Once I was prescribed Xanax I noticed that the medication would actually stop a panic attack in its tracks which was a miracle The medication has almost completely stopped the attacks but not
7900,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40908,22,Xanax is a miracle Just recently prescribed Xanax and Lexapro at age for generalized anxiety disorder and I can honestly say that I am back to my old self I have only had panic attacks in the last months I can sleep all night without waking up I am much more laid back I am calm and not worrying all the time I would definitely talk to your MD about both of these medicines if you truly have an Anxiety disorder Both have been a life saver for me and my family
7901,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40907,37,I have had horrible panic attacks out of nowhere since I was in elementary school I got on Xanax when I was years old and still take it today It has been a God send and I have tried cognitivebehavioral therapy counseling SSRIs other benzodiazepines etc and this has been the medication that has helped the most I have gotten my anxiety under control and only take it as needed
7902,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40905,39,This medicine has saved my life tentimesover given me a quality of life on par with others and above all else allowed me to succeed I have had panic disordersince childhood and wasnt prescribed Xanax until age Now I can do anything I want panic and anxiety free The sky is the limit really This is medicine can save lives the perfect freedom gift
7903,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40904,31,I have taken Xanax for years and it has been a lifesaver for me When my psychiatrist prescribed it for me years ago I was just about at the end of my rope I was crying all the time was hyperventilating had bouts of my heart fluttering and many other typical quotanxietyrelatedquot symptoms I was at the point that I was afraid I was dying or going crazy Over the years my dosage has been adjusted to work with my life at the time but I have always taken it exactly as prescribed and have never wanted or needed more than was prescribed As a matter of fact I am currently taking mg two times per day but can take as much as mg five times per day
7904,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40904,10,Works great for short notices If you find yourself in a anxiety situation or short notice to do some public speaking then Xanax is great for those situations When I take them I only take half the pill and that dose is fine for me It kicks in about minutes and lasts a good couple of hours at the most Its similar to Klonopin but works faster I recommend it for as needed use only If its an all day thing then Klonopin is better Just my experience with it Others may vary
7906,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39908,29,Xanax is the most effective nonhabit forming medication for me I have severe general anxiety disorder
7908,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,39898,29,My face hands and feet get numb and I dont know what to do Im in school and freak out Im a hairdresser so I cant just stop and breath in a bag This medicine worked for me Hope it works for you
7911,Xanax,Anxiety,9,39884,67,GREAT for anxiety The ONLY problem Ive had is after taking it regularly when I try to reduce the dosage or frequency my anxiety increases
7912,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39884,67,VERY GOOD for panic attacks and relief of anxiety No known problems while on Xanax However cutting down the dosage or frequency of use can cause increased anxiety and so it can cause dependency I have no prblems with Xanax just problems when I dont have it

7914,Xanax,Anxiety,9,39873,32,Prescibed Xanax for my anxiety and panic disorder This drug is a God send for me as I take it along with BuSpar and only when those escalating anxiety and panic monsters show their faces It is fast acting and will help to prevent you from going to the full blown attack The downsides is that the doctors do not like to write the scripts for this

7925,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39810,69,During the recession of the early s I took this drug for a period of about months to combat anxiety The doctor first tried prozac but that didnt work for me at all As soon as I started taking Xanax I began to feel better I was able to put worrying thoughts into perspective I highly recommend it
7926,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39806,7,I prefer the ER vs IR because you then only need one to two tablets per day
7927,Xanax,Depression,10,39796,52,I am being treated for severe depression I take mg of Zoloft once a day and mg of Xanax a day It has taken me a long time to get on medication for my condition but I am glad I decided to now I feel completely calm and havent felt depressed since I started taking both of these Its been months now
7928,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39791,401,Xanax is a miracle for me I cant live without it It is not addicting I never experienced withdrawl symptoms either I am usually tense high strung and anxious Xanax makes me happy easy going talkative calm It helps me sleep I cant sleep without it I take zoloft and seroquel but without xanax nothing seems to work or help me I love xanax and I take it daily or else I really just cant get through the day I have anger and a short fuse and bad temper and xanax calms my storms Xanax is the only thing that works for me and makes me sane and able to face life head on

7933,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41190,69,This medicine has saved my life in my own opinion I suffered from severe panic attacks and thought that I was going crazy prior to being diagnosed with my conditions Now I feel like I can lead a normal life I am able to work a full time job that is extremely stressful at times and not worry about going into a panic attack I no longer have trouble losing my breath when I do get upset and this medicine has made a tremedious difference in my every day life
7934,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41181,52,Unbelieveable I thought I was living a normal life until my doctor prescribed it for me the first time It has been a miracle for me
7935,Xanax,Depression,9,41179,98,I am prescribed to take two Xanax a day but in reality I only take it when I am having a panic attack or feeling very tense or unhappy It works better for anxiety and tension then it does depression as far as I can tell but then again I dont take it consistently
7937,Xanax,Anxiety,8,41142,41,Wonderful to control anxiety as well as panic disorder
7938,Xanax,Tinnitus,9,41140,92,I was taking mg per day at equal intervals I tried to stop completely and the noise came roaring back So I went back on mg per day and the noise is reduced by or more with minimal side effects so far
7939,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41137,42,Happy and free of anxiety
7940,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41134,50,As many people stated Xanax has given me my life back Along side Paxil When I had severe severe anxiety I took half a Xanax daily but now that Im thankfully a million times better I only take it once in a blue moon when I feel like I need it and take a quarter of a pill This is amazing
7941,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41133,46,Ive been tormented by anxiety since childhood I am years old and have been through a lot in my life Ive been diagnosed with depression bipolar disorder and anxiety panic attacks ADD Ive been medicated most my life as well My anxiety got so bad in high school that I had to be home schooled I wake up in the morning feeling like my heart will explode for no apparent reason I get intense irrational fear and intense impulses to harm myself because I just cant take it and get frustrated I start throwing and breaking things I cant stand to be alone a lot of the time Xanax works fast and calms me down without knocking me out Depending on the severity of my attacks I take up to mg No less than mg
7942,Xanax,Anxiety,8,41126,50,Xanax has been a great thing for me I was very scared to take it in the beginning because I had no idea how I was going to feel but it really calmed me down after two weeks of thinking I was going crazy or dying I had never experienced anything like this before but I had to get a blood transfusion for my anemia and all hell broke through My doctor gave me and I only take of that I Break it in s I dont want to go to sleep just take the edge off so my advice to anyone that has to take this even if you have a higher dose just take of it until you see how it will respond to your body I hope I could be a help to someone
7943,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,41121,29,I was suffering from nocturnal anxiety attacks for several months but Xanax helps me get a good nights rest most of the time mg gets me to sleep but mg knocks me out for the whole night I do not find that I wake up groggy or experience any other side effects although I am wary about withdrawal symptoms Its a great medicine overall though
7944,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41116,48,This is an ABSOULUTE LIFE SAVER if you have bad anxiety or having a panic attack Would be lost without it
7945,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41111,26,Very effective medication not quite as long lasting as similar ones but very effective
7946,Xanax,Dysautonomia,10,41107,30,Only thing that keeps me sane and under my own control
7947,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41107,63,This medicine has helped me so much I suffer from severe panic attacks times a day I think I am dying all the time Without this medicine I dont know what or where I would be
7949,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,41078,38,Am female veteran that served in Afghanistan and Iraq in the Navy I got out in and have been going to the VA ever since I have post traumatic stress disorder and extremely bad panic attacks At least to xs a day I cant leave my home Im paralyzed with fear At first the VA came up with the right combination of QUETIAPINE and MG Xanax Daily I was able to go back to work as a correctional officer at a Georgia state prison I was happy and my kids were happy Miracle Then the VA Mental Health Center at Dublin canceled all Xanax for everyone last January In the last year I have lost my job friends kids Im scared all the time I have on slots of panic attacks and cant leave the house anymore
7950,Xanax,Anxiety,10,41052,18,Good
7952,Xanax,Depression,8,41032,113,I have been diagnosed with depression and panic disorder for years now I learned over the years that if I could keep my anxietypanic under good control I would be much less likely to go into depression uncontrolled anxiety greatly increases the chance I will experience depression Xanax works extremely well at keeping my anxiety and hence depression under control These days I dont need to use it continuously because just knowing that Xanax is there and works so well if I need it has a calming effect I didnt give Xanax though because it has one annoying side effect for me it kills my libido rather effectively if I take it for a few days Apart from that very tolerable way more so than any antidepressant I was on
7955,Xanax,Anxiety,8,40264,20,Works great for my anxiety attacks but after years Ive gone from mg twice a day to mg twice a day Getting quotanxiousquot about what will happen when this dose stops working
7956,Xanax,Depression,10,40263,126,I think Xanax works great taking it along with an antidepressant Right now I am currently taking mg of Xanaz along with mg of Celexa I believe it has helped me out it so many ways I used to have anxiety and panic attacks pretty much all day or part of the day that I was awake I havent felt this good about myself in a long time Sometimes I would get a panic attack just from walking in a public place such as a supermarket and then came the heavy breathing and the nervous feeling out of nowhere But the Xanax put all the feelings to rest I know its a narcotic and it can be abused and it also can cause dependency But if used the right way I know it can work for some of the worst conditions of depression
7958,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40243,62,Ive tried everything for anxiety which is severe ALL the time XANAX WORKS Only issue is the length of time it lasts I can feel the effects almost immediately within minutes and continue to feel effects kicking in for a good hour after but after about hours I start to have rebound anxiety from it wearing off Be careful of tolerance though Since Ive been on it Ive had to increase x I started of with mg xday and am now on mg xday I dont want to change that but this seems to be a perfect It gives me the relief I need as often as my body seems to need it I am so grateful for this drug as my panic is nonexistent where it hasnt been in YEARS Its been non stop never relief I finally feel relief
7959,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40235,48,I am prescribed mg Xanax twice a day as needed It works very well for me when I have high anxiety I have no side effects at all from this drug I dont even get sleepy with it I just feel calmer I have taken a variety of benzodiazepines for years and I have never had a problem with an addiction to any of them and I have a history of drug abuse I would just say to take as needed and at the correct dose and dont take continuously for a long time and you should do good with Xanax
7961,Xanax,Anxiety,8,40222,13,I am a year old male prescribed to a mg dosage of Xanax to be taken twice daily Depending on my spouts of anxiety or an occasional panic attack I either take one or a half of one to calm my state of mind I try to just take a half of one because this medication can be addicting I noticed these effects and feelings right after my first intake It does indeed help suppress my anxiety and panic attacks Due to the addiction prone aspects Im giving it an
7962,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40221,32,I was the caregiver for family members from to I had the first fullblown stress panic attack in Xanax was one of my medications and in months I was off drugs I have no regrets for those years but thought I was finally free to live my life However I was wrong I now have continuous anxiety if I dont take mg Xanax in the morning and evening I also have very high blood pressure to which a solution has not been found Xanax does lower it and I couldnt keep my sanity without it I have had no negative side effects only positive
7963,Xanax,Depression,10,40217,62,This pill got the job done
7964,Xanax,Anxiety,6,40216,18,I had panic attacks in my entire life I went to a Doctor and was given Xanax at half mg to take immediately and hrs later It worked and I thought I would keep some handy for any possible future attacks He prescribed mg pills times a day I looked it up on the internet and didnt like the information on addiction I went to my Doctor when I got back home and he prescribed Ativan I believe Xanax should be used only when having a panic attack and not as a maintenance drug
7965,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40213,17,I was prescribed mg of Xanax for my hyperanxiety and panic attacks As a lb man I needed a mg dose Xanax really solves panic attacks well and noticeably helps with my anxiety It makes it much easier to fall asleep which is great at bedtime but can be a real problem in the morning Reading quotFeeling Goodquot by Dr David Burns also really helped treat the thoughts that led to panic and anxiety
7966,Xanax,Depression,9,40205,60,Every time I had a depression its very difficult for me to sleep my friend said I should consult my doctor and so I did My doctor prescribed me this medicineIts really good Thumbs up
7970,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40193,16,I personally truly enjoy the fact that while my anxieties are prominent the Xanax provides me with the security to take a deep breath and if things become too overwhelming I have the option of taking it when needed
7972,Xanax,Anxiety,6,40188,17,I was switched onto this drug after taking lorazepam Ativan which I was very happy with and had almost no side effects with I started taking it combined with Effexor and it was horrible I would take it pass out for an hour and wake up feeling the same as before I could see how it would be good for a panic attack but for general anxiety it is not very good If you are on a constant dose you will be taking them about to times a day which is too much to keep up withI also found much more intense effects from this drug which I consider dangerous because I dont want to get addicted to themI think the drug is good for anxiety attacks but for general anxieties I would ask for lorazepam or klonopin
7973,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40164,61,I have been diagnosed with both Dysautonomia and GAD I cannot take SSRIs as they throw me into an extreme panic state starting with pill one I finally gave in and accepted Xanax from my doctor My dosage is times a day I never take the prescribed dose but rather pill in the morning daytime if needed and I rarely take at night My life has done a complete turnaround I have energy again Im not so tense snappy or experiencing the extreme anxiety that would peak at around pm Im careful to take as I need and while doctors may not like prescribing it the truth is many of us will be on medication forever Ive found something that doesnt feel like medication I just feel like me
7974,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40161,8,Great
7975,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40160,24,I take Paxil mg a day and mg of Xanax times a day I have as everyone else here does a very horrible panic disorder with agoraphobia I cannot and do not leave my house It has been yrs now that I cannot go outside unless if I am with someone and that is a short outing Xanax is my life saving drug Yes it doesnot last long in your body but with the Paxil and Xanax together I no longer need to call to go to the ER Only once did I within the last months due to finding out my best friend in the whole world my dad has cancer but as long as this medicine is not abused it works great With the help of my therapist and psych doctor I hope someday I can go outside but I am still afraid due to the bad panic disorder I have
7978,Xanax,Anxiety,9,40156,27,Xanax is the best anxiety medication that I have taken over the past several years I have been prescribed at least ten or more different medicines and some work to an extent but none are near as effective than Xanax Xanax has truly been a lifesaver hands down for my anxiety and panic attacks
7979,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40148,22,This medicine saved my life after my mother died and shortly after my daughters father was killed It helped me relax and I was a lot easier to take it day by day A great alternative to alcohol
7981,Xanax,Depression,9,40028,76,When nervous or uncomfortable just pop a Xanax and I become as cool as a cucumber I have a friend who cant even go more then miles from her house without getting a panic attack She takes a Xanax and she is willing to hop on flights to Las Vegas
7982,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40027,40,I have had severe panic attacks all my life I dont even know how to explain what this makes you fell like its like you cant catch your breath your hands start to go numb My head goes numb Then I felt like I am going to pass out or am having a stroke I have nothing but a positive experience with this medicine and I have tried others They didnt work I have never had any side effects with Xanax So its a but take only as prescibed
7983,Xanax,Anxiety,4,40014,84,Xanax worked wonders for my anxiety Next thing I know I only ate one meal every four days and lost pounds in two weeks Withdrawal is the worst I vomited for seven weeks straight and at least twice a day Ive been clean for two months I still dont sleep until fivesix in the morning I have slight muscle tremors Prescriptions must be monitored extremely carefully
7984,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40008,30,Love it It made me really relaxedcalm and still able to do my work
7985,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40004,32,Works great for me when I use it on a quotper attackquot basis My Doctor put me on it times a day and that will make it ineffective I only take it when I feel my heart starting to race and within to minutes I am back to normal
7986,Xanax,Depression,5,40004,50,I have suffered severe depression for years and was finally coming out of it with a cocktail of Lithium Luvox and Epilim When the anxiety kicked in my doctor prescribed Xanax which worked but the come down was the worst I have ever had Just a personal experience on mixing drugs I guess
7987,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40000,32,This is the best thing for panic attacks ever When I feel one coming on I can take mg and let it melt under my tongue and it works very fast It has saved me from going to the ER so many times My hat goes off to Xanax
7988,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39997,39,This drug is currently working for my anxiety that is blood pressure related I was on Clonazepam and that made me high and groggy but did not help anxiety Xanax has worked perfectly reduces my symptoms and no high feeling The minute I get freaked and have racy thoughts panic it curbs it then I can get on with my day I have not noticed any side effects and my friends and family have seen improvement
7989,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39980,88,I have cancer and this drug takes my mind of death and is a great sleep aid
7994,Xanax,Anxiety,7,39947,36,I found Xanax to be the only thing to help me
7995,Xanax,Panic Disorde,9,39939,58,Since Xanax is so shortacting it should be a well thought decision to use for panic disorder However all people are different and metabolize the medication differently So for some like me Xanax worked better than other medicines For years I am so thankful that any benzodiazepine is available as my panic disorder is moderately severe
7997,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39937,134,Xanax is the best medicine I was dizzy for two months straight I felt like I was on a boat and couldnt get off My whole life was just a mess between working full time school personal life until I found Xanax I am on mg twice a day and I have my life back I can tolerate people again This is the wonder drug Other than being a little more tired than normal which I will suffer through because it is better than biting peoples heads off every chance I got
7999,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39927,13,Had panic attacks since I was Been on Xanax since then If I dont take it Ill get an attack
8000,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39917,15,Wonderful drug
8001,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39916,66,This drug helps with anxiety so much Im taking mg only when I need it It works great
8003,Xanax,Anxiety,2,39912,47,Xanax made me crazy I am now in the process of weaning off of it You cannot stop Xanax cold turkey Itll be another two weeks before Im done
8004,Xanax,Anxiety,9,39910,201,Xanax has probably helped keep me alive and breathing over the last two years The toll of being a military wife mom fulltime worker etc had me so stressed out that I began to procrastinate on EVERYTHING because I couldnt emotionally handle things like paying bills running errands etc I only take mg of Xanax as needed but just knowing its in my purse helps me keep my busy life moving ahead Combined with Zoloft for depression and Ambien for insomnia I finally feel like a normal person I feel sorry for the woman I used to be but Im so happy to be myself now
8005,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40147,27,I use Xanax occasionally as required I feel relaxed in real sense feel increase in mental abilities sleep well and when I wake up Im in a very fresh mood
8006,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40147,17,Very good for anxiety and I think it helps for depression
8007,Xanax,Tinnitus,10,40135,133,It helps me a lot and I dont know what Id do without it It has changed my life Thank you to whoever made this drug
8008,Xanax,Panic Disorde,7,40133,29,I have been on Xanax for about ten years and now it is has had to come to a screeching hault At first mg three times a day was great Ii could work go into social settings and even to stores It gradually got up to mgs times a day for about years then came the beginning of the end I had began using more and more of this wonder drug and I ran out horrible withdrawal symptoms beginning with night sweats not sleeping confusion and finally seizures not to mention the mental twists and games my mind played on me Now I am on Klonopin and its taken the edge off today I dont get the wonder drug feeling and Im not having seizures we will see Careful with use of this medicine
8009,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40130,12,I have been taking a combination of mg Xanax times a day mg extended release Xanax once daily and mg klonopin twice daily I have found that this combination of medications and Xanax itself has helped me get my mind back on the things that matter in my life Get over my fears and make an enormous amount of friends in my life Although the only problem is that my doctor now tells me after months of taking this dose that he thinks the Depakote mg a day is helping me and that he is going to start taking me off the benzodiazapines I tried to see if I would be able to get off of them and live normally I found myself worse than before the medication with severe withdrawal symptoms
8010,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40122,34,Started having panic attacks on a regular basis soon after bypass surgery at yrs I thought the antidepressant I had been taking for some yrs wasnt working anymore After suffering with this for several years I had a real good one which sent me to the ER They gave me a Xanax Unbelievable it was like a wave of calm went through me Havent been without the drug since I take it when I feel an attack coming on and it just dosent happen It helps you live a normal life
8011,Xanax,Anxiety,1,40119,52,Xanax was a God send when I was in a terrible car accident and lost my best friend I knew that it was a controlled substance so that made me wearly I recently got into a relationship and my boyfriends whole family is highly addicted to Xanax They are prescribed them buy them off the street and so on They fight each other for quotbarsquot and pay a fortune for them The family is a complete wreck family members had forgotten important things like family matters misplacing wallets purses etc even getting into car accidents while theyre on them They helped me when I took them as prescribed but seeing how my boyfriends family act while on the drug I would be careful
8013,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40118,31,It works very well for me
8014,Xanax,Panic Disorde,6,40113,25,Xanax got me through a year or so of acute anxiety and debilitating panic attacks I got rather attached to those pretty lavender pills I called them quotmy darling little Easter eggsquot they were so precious in relieving the terror that developed into agoraphobia At max dose I was so sedated I started calling it quotZombinalquot It had stopped working its magic and under the care of a naturopath I simply stopped taking it Amazingly after a couple of shaky days my anxiety diminished and panic attacks were history I later learned that between depleted receptors and miniwithdrawls Xanax was actually causing my symptoms No more Xanax no more panic not even the slightest anxiety I guess I got cured
8015,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40112,30,Found the brand name was by far more effective than generic alprazolam I find typically I do much better with brand names than generics depending on your co pays Id go for the brand names the difference in my insurance is generics are and brand is so its a world of a difference to me I felt or thought the Xanax wasnt working but realized I was on generic alprazolam and switched it it was like night and day
8016,Xanax,Depression,10,40107,38,It is great
8017,Xanax,Anxiety,6,40106,30,I have been on Alprazolam for years for panic disorder and anxiety I am still on the same dosage that I was ten years ago and I am definitely sure that drug companies differ in their drug production Whenever I pick up a prescription and the pharmacy tells me its quotjust a different companyquot the red flag goes up The oval shaped mg tablet just does not work as well at the round mg tablet
8018,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40097,29,Medication works fast I received instant results Amazing If I only knew before I could have experienced less miserable days
8019,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40094,20,I have been on Xanax Alprazolam for over years for severe panic attacks and perpetual anxiety from PTSD and horrible things going on in my life Ive found this to be very effective to rapidly nip this in the bud for a short period of time I do not abuse this and am a non drinker Life is so out of control for me that this is the only thing that works to any degree
8021,Xanax,Anxiety,10,40080,10,They are a huge help I have posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety and agoraphobia and if I didnt have Xanax dont think I could go out of the house I also have seizures and take Topamax Everything got worse when my libido passed Now I can do the things I used to do
8023,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,40076,27,This medicine saved my life it helped me cope with my panic disorder
8027,Xanax,Anxiety,1,40053,15,It made me tired and didnt relieve my anxiety
8030,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39780,27,My anxiety gave me depersonalization Whenever I take xanax it clears right up for me especially if I run out of Klonopin Its a great back up that helps me when that sudden feeling of panic creeps up on me

8034,Xanax,Panic Disorde,8,39768,55,It works on a panic attack like you wouldnt believe and has saved me from all the ER visits throughout my life but I also suffer from deppresion Xanax did straighten my life out It is a miracle pill and I recommend it if you have anxiety or panic disorder I have been on this drug for about years Im years old now
8035,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39765,142,After taking this medication I feel very tranquil I am an easy going person when I take it I am calm and I dont have that high feeling I hate I am coherent but calm No one really bothers me Its a miracle because before I used it my husband used to get on my nerves my kids would get under my skin at the grocery market I wanted to knock out someone but now I am a nice calm person that can be approached and even has fun
8037,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39750,64,I have suffered from severe panic attacks for years Xanax is the ONLY medicine that has helped me I dont take it times daily as prescribed I take it only when I have a panic attack It works wonders
8038,Xanax,Depression,8,39742,60,I have severe depression and general anxiety disorder I take mgday of Zoloft and that pretty well takes care of my depression and most of my panic attacks Occasionally Ill take mg for a panic attack but Im cautious because sometimes the downside of coming off a panic attack sends me into a fit of depression I highly recommend both Zoloft and Xanax I just want to put the word out there to use good judgement when treating a panic attack when you have depression as well
8039,Xanax,Anxiety,10,39742,69,There is not a better drug than xanax for my anxiety I love it Thanks to this drug I can do simple things like go to my kids schools with out going into a panic attack

8042,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39727,39,With the panic attacks I get it seems Xanax works fairly fast when I feel one coming on or even when I am in the middle of one It calms me down and I can cope I have taken it for several years and have felt no side effects I am glad it is available to me
8043,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39722,176,I have used Xanax since I love it It has saved my life so many times I cant count I have gone through different times in my life where I had to take mgs a day just to survive the panic attacks My attacks come in cycles I have had them since years old and I am now I am so tired of them and feeling them I had a big one today as a matter of fact I am going through withdrawl of getting off of Lexapro I am never without my Xanax though Simply carrying it around helps keep off the panic attacks sometimes If I hadnt had it I would have been put away or had killed myself long ago because having panic attacks is no way to live

8054,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39626,43,Its good and helps very very much
8056,Vivactil,Depression,9,42946,0,This is one of the most under rated drugs for depression I found it myself and every time I mention it to a new doctor they have never heard of it I am afraid they will someday stop making it which would be a tragedy It saved my lifemultiple timeswhen NOTHING else worked Id had every SSRI in the book thrown at me because OF COURSE if one doesnt work SURELY another of the same type will No weight gainactual loss Pulls me out of suicidal despair within a few hours I still have a bottle for emergencies For me however as a longterm treatment it would start making me apatheticnot lethargic just kind of nonchalant After days on it I would want to quit my job Fast acting low side effects mildly energizing
8060,Xolegel,Seborrheic Dermatitis,10,42808,3,After four months of thinking I had chronic dry skin on my face I saw a dermatologist who diagnosed me with seborrheic dermatitis He gave me a prescription for Xolegel It is VERY expensive at over tube but my insurance brought it down to and then a discount card from the manufacturer brought it down to only In three days the redness and scaling on my face were gone I cant imagine not having this medication
8061,Xolegel,Seborrheic Dermatitis,1,42403,18,I received a Xologel perscription instead of my usual ketaconazole cream I went to the local pharmacy and was shown a bill of I laughed at the poor cashier and said quotno thanksquot Called my dermatologist back and got a cream for There is a program on their website where people can get the drug for only on top of their copay if their insurance doesnt cover the drug What this seems to imply is that if your insurance wont pay they will give it to you for what it is actually worth A perfect example of the broken medical system and greed The price of this drug has gone up over in the last few years Next time I see an Aqua box at my pharmacy it will be refused
8063,Xolegel,Seborrheic Dermatitis,5,40273,26,The symptoms were improved but not to the extent mentioned by other reviewers of this product The gel was prescribed for use twice a day but at the end of each day had redness itching and scaling again
8065,Xolegel,Seborrheic Dermatitis,10,39547,66,Worked right away overnight took away all redness and stopped ALL the itching what a huge relief GREAT PRODUCT
8066,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,9,43009,0,I have been suffering painirritationdistraction where my eyeglasses touch my face for over a decade Since I also have very severe dry eye syndrome so my treatments have always focused on my eyes out of desperation I tried to treat my skin conditions instead since last year and tried different skin creams including those with steroids then came to Epiceram in May I have been using Epiceram since May and my conditions have been improving every day even though very slowly understandably considering how bad and long my conditions are I test my improvements by put my eyeglasses on and feel the level of pain and irritation under the nosepads and Finally yesterday I began to wear glasses againAmazing stuff
8069,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,1,42565,6,Massive allergic reaction looked like skin had been burned has taken days of hydrocortisone to calm down
8071,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,10,42279,10,Our baby girl had eczema and the normal oat bath amp moisturizing routine was not helping We had to see a Pediatric Dermatologist who prescribed EpiCream for regular use and Hydrocortisone cream for the more stubborn instances We were honestly sceptical about using EpiCream and did not think this overpriced product will help but nevertheless gave it a try We were pleasantly surprised to find that the product worked very well for our baby and the eczema almost disappeared within hours of usage I have to agree with the reviewer earlier who mentioned that the cream creates more of a stinging sensation for the baby than a tingling sensation as mentioned by the manufacturers Happy to be proven wrong in this instance
8072,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,1,42265,4,Does not work Over the counter cortizone for eczema works better This was an overpriced waste of money Not only that they have at the ready a list of nine reasons for not giving you the promised refund of any cost over I got reason which makes no sense something about I filled the prescription within days Wellyes of course I did What is your point In other words you will not get a refund of any overage Before paying the high price for this quotproductquot try the popular cortisone brand from your neighborhood drug store for under ten dollars
8074,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,10,42107,3,My hands and fingers were raw with extremely painful cracks Within days of using Epiceram the healing process began
8075,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,10,41674,35,Have suffered from eczema all over face neck upper body Nothing worked and I had to moisturize every mins throughout the day yrs ago I stopped using topical steroids and had a serious rebound effect of worsening eczema Since then its been manageable but has never improved Ive tried changing my diet going organic different moisturizers bleach baths Bactroban etc It was hard to get the prescription as this is a product that not many Drs are familiar with In weeks I almost finished the g tube but my skin improved so much My face is babysmooth I could go for hrs without moisturizer I finally have hope again It still itches but the skin quality has drastically improved No side effects And no more steroids
8076,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,10,41319,39,My partner has suffered from severe facial eczema for the past few years far worse than she had ever experienced before We tried everything from dietary interventions to Elidel to various steroids We were truly growing quite desperate as the eczema was so severe it was limiting my partners ability to go out work or even smile and laugh EpiCeram has completely turned her condition around to the point where the facial eczema is almost totally eliminated The results were FAR beyond what I even dared hope for
8077,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,10,40922,34,Epiceram cream is amazing for eczema The same day I applied the cream I noticed and felt a difference within a few hours Two days later the eczema on my eye lids and around my mouth were clear I use the cream sparingly and it works better than ANY other prescription My insurance didnt cover it but Im so glad I took a chance and paid for it It was well worth the Hopefully it will soon be available over the counter
8079,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,9,40399,47,I have suffered with atopic dermatitis moderatesevere for years The inflammation and itchiness has been nonstop My skin has been red and inflamed on my face neck arms hands and most of my body Often my skin has become so damaged from itching and scratching that various regions of my skin have split such as my eyelids neck and knucklesI HAVE USED EPICERAM FOR WEEK AND ALL THE REDNESS HAS NEARLY CLEARED UP AND THERE ARE NO SPLITS AT ALL I FEEL GREATI can sleep comfortablyI can shower without the pain of water stinging my damaged skinI can exercise again without sweat causing burningI highly recommend this cream
8080,EpiCeram,Dry Skin,8,40319,19,My month old baby boy has used this for a week and within days of use I noticed a big improvement in his skin It had become soft again not so dry and rough The only problem is he screams every time we put it on him so its more like stinging for the first min rather then tingling as listed in side effects
8082,All Day Allergy,Allergic Rhinitis,9,40074,4,I have chronic hayfever and take Zyrtec D now it is the best
8083,Bacitracin / neomycin / polymyxin b,Conjunctivitis Bacterial,10,42754,0,Great medicine
8084,Bacitracin / neomycin / polymyxin b,Not Listed / Othe,9,39693,3,I used this to treat acne At first I was sceptical but it worked a dream at curing my acne I tried getting it from the doctor but apprently it isnt used for skin conditions but I would totally recommend it for acne it helped me so much

8102,Xanax,Panic Disorde,10,39506,127,it works in association with my antidepressant to bring about a well rounded me but it is there to take when my panic attacks hit it quickly takes effect and calms me
8103,Xanax,Anxiety,7,39505,346,I wish doctors would open their eyes and prescribe this medicine easier Just because I panic easily doesnt mean Im a psychotic Docs lighten up I need them
8104,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,43071,3,Ambien is a lifesaver No matter how tired I am I cant fall asleep or stay asleep With Ambien I sleep all night I have been taking it for about years but I ONLY take mg I think the mistake people make is they take too much Its not supposed to drug you and make you pass out It allows you to fall asleep naturally No need to increase amount Try it
8106,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,43054,6,Itrsquos been a miracle drug for me for years Just take it responsibly I started off mgnight now Irsquom on mgnight never anything more mg still works for me even after years of being at this dose For someone who needs to be functional productive and aware in the morning a good nightrsquos sleep is essential It might not work for everyone but as a chronic insomniac since childhood Itrsquos been a life saver
8107,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,43051,2,Ambien itself is fantastic never missed a night of sleep and hours a night On the other hand this generic zolpidem tartrate is absolute garbage Ive tried for a very very long time to see if it would work and it never has I noticed it slowly stopped working when I picked up the new prescription for what I was told would be ambien but was the zolpidem I do not only barely sleep with it I do not sleep at all when I take it Keeps me up until the next night makes me feel mildly high without sleeping and they just do not work at all Ive read so many reviews in the past hour or so sharing the same experience Cheaper is not better when its prescription meds Someone should tell the moronic Big Pharma companies
8111,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,43033,1,It is the best but respect it Take as instructedor you will wake up down the road It is the best sleep pill in town Ive taken it every nite for years It is bad that it is so needed but it would be worst if I never got to sleep because then I could not provide for my family Just thankful for this med
8112,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,43025,3,I dont feel the generic ambian that I have been taking for months is affective in helping me sleep I seem to wake up about every two hours I would rate this medication a one
8113,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,43025,3,Ive been taking zolpidem for a few months I use it between nights a week Its not recommended to take it nightly but it works Im years old Maybe its addictive but so is sleep I feel ever so much better the next day I dont notice any side effects yet
8114,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,43019,0,This did nothing for me
8115,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,43012,3,I have a script for mg pills I take one before bed about an hour and sleep through the night I have read others say it does not work and it may not for that individual but it works for me
8116,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,43012,1,I find that ambien with my proper dosing mgs to be very effective mgs just doesnt do it No side effects give yourself enough time to sleep otherwise you will be drowsy the next day A good hours if possible But everyones different and some cant if they wanted to sleep that long
8117,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,43011,0,The pill Zolpidem lsquos dosing is inconsistent with each pill I cannot sleep
8118,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,43000,18,Ive been on ambien CR for over years then all of a sudden the doctors want to change things up tried mg didnt work now on and kind of working but only get days worth and they keep telling me I have to get off itwhy Dont screw with what works now my anxiety is worse never knowing if I can get my meds to sleep
8121,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42984,8,Works wonders
8122,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42981,9,It has really assisted me with falling asleep and I do not have the sleepy groggy effect the next day
8123,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42978,10,I have had amnestic episodes I have had conversations with my spouse that at time were extremely distressing to him the next day I would have no memory the discussions I have walked in my sleep A few times I was saved from hurting myself eg thinking telling him that I was going to the bathroom but starting to sit down before I got there and luckily caught by my husband or I might have struck my head if he had not caught me I didnt remember those times as well But my strange behavior started to worry my husband a loving and devoted spouseI have gone onto the internet while on Ambien and bought items At first I was puzzled by unexpected deliveries of whatever I had bought I realized the impact of Ambien on my life
8124,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42978,3,I have been taken mg of zolpadiem a night and sleep very well although some nite I have really bad dreams but at least Im getting some sleep now as I wasnt sleeping at all and nothing else worked apart from theses
8125,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42972,21,I work in a hospital with long hours that can vary between days When I finally got home and needed to sleep Id be kept up with adrenaline from the shift I started Ambien and was pretty happy with it I would be out like a light for a solid hours and wake up refreshed with no hangover side effects like I get with benadryl or melatonin You might wake up and eat something weird some nights and not remember but I just look at it as entertainment mgnightstay up for about an hour and get the quothighquot people say and then put yourself down for some incredible relaxed sleep
8126,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42969,8,Would not be here without it I am
8128,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42960,7,I started taking zolpidem several months after my son was KIA in Afghanistan almost years ago My sons death along with menopause has me feeling like I will never fall sleep naturally again This works incredibly well I take mg after Im in bed and am deeply a asleep within to minutes I wake up refreshed and ready for the day ahead I have never had any of the possible side effects that many others have listed Reading the potential side effects that some people experience I do get a little concerned but since I have never had an issue with this drug I plan to keep taking it for as long as I need it Ive tried other sleep medications and they all have terrible side effects for me
8130,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42951,8,It made me feel angry lonely and my depression was worsened After weeks of taking this I knew something was wrong with me I paid for a month supply and threw away most
8132,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42939,9,Ive been taking mg every night for over a year I used to be a napper sleeping hrs on and hrs off sometimes I would stay awake for days at a time Im prescribed mg nightly I sleep thru the night and feel rested the next day with no hangover effect I do not take it if I feel I can sleep without it I have never had an adverse reaction to it This medication has changed my life
8134,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42931,9,Its hard for me to fall asleep almost every night And Im also a very light sleeper I dont take it every night mg just when Im having issues with trying to fall asleepstay asleep One of the first times taking it about a year ago I was visiting my mom I took the pill and laid down About min later I started sweating and felt really weird I started hallucinating like crazy I was seeing a cat on the bed and then I started seeing people in the room I then started to freak out and got really scared I got up to use the bathroom and then fell into the wall She helped me back to bed The whole experience was SO scary I now take mg and it works fine w no issues I think the dose was too much
8135,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42920,29,I love ambien It is the only thing that works for me A few yrs ago when I started becoming a worse insomniac nothing would work I remember trying tylonal pm and at first one worked then had to bump up to two then so on and so on until one day I had taken way too many and a Valium and I still wouldnt pass out I would be all drunk off the meds but it was like the light switch in my head wouldnt turn off I slept maybe a nap here and there for about a week and was thinking of checking my self into a nutty house because I would drive somewhere without remembering all from lack of sleep Very long story short ambien is the only thing to me that I take and feels like a natural lay my head down and go to sleep
8136,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42918,3,This medication just makes me more frustratedabsolutely not a wink of sleep for two nights in a row I just feel extremely exhausted but cannot sleep even after taking the pill about hours ago instead Im getting a pounding headache
8138,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42903,20,I have had good luck with this drug Diag with early onset parkinsons in yo With parkinsons you need a good nights sleep to help repair your brain For me pill does the trick and puts me to sleep for about hours sure bets laying awake all night
8140,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42896,5,I was on a cross country flight and took ambien in hopes of sleeping through the ordeal I have severe anxiety when it comes to flying and a seemingly unattainable dream of mine is to be able to board pass out wake up when we land I took TWO ambien and was rewarded with some mild symptoms of intoxication a headache and a few weepy spells I thought this medication would do what I needed but now I guess I officially know theres no way to snuff out my nerves
8141,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,42893,13,This helps you sleep alright but I would hallucinate before I finally feel asleep I would do as I was told take it when I was in bed ready to go to sleep One night everything turned a soft pink color and I swore my cat was urgently trying to tell me something Another night I thought my then roommate had a party in the living room after I went to bed I have friends who take it and do things like make phone calls they dont remember and even cook and eat food I dont recommend it
8144,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42874,11,Ambien or Zolped was terrible I started hallucinating Now I do drink caffeine in the morning but it should not have this koo koo effect My ceiling turned into peaceful litup jellyfish tentacles and my pillow turned into a movingbillowing cloud of a worm Pretty crazy but that is what I saw when I took this crap I was dazed it didnt initially help me fall asleep Perhaps Im allergic to Ambien I have no idea I believe I took it with or mg of melatonin Whew that was a cocktail to go nuts Stick with Tamazepam Restoril way better
8146,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42867,4,Zolpidem is OK not great as as sleeping aid I do experience a rather weird side effect sleepwalking and sleepeating Every morning my fridge looks as if the locusts have feasted fortunately I dont have a weight problem
8147,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42865,28,I absolutely love Ambien Love it However building up a tolerance sucks the drug testing sucks having to have a doctors appointment monthly to get a prescription sucks and knowing Im taking something I know I could become dependent on sucks No groggy mornings if taken within a half hour of going to bed I can fall asleep easily and a few funny text conversations to wake up to I have tried SO many things and this is so far the only one that has even helped
8148,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42862,4,Got a recipe for insomnia It makes me sleep great but during the day I feel like garbage and very depressed Crying a lot I dont recommend it
8149,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42858,8,Im taking this medication as prescibe by my doctor it has not helped at all in fact the third time taking it I did not feel sleepy nor did I fall asleep
8150,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42850,21,Ive been on it two years it has been wonderful for me the only downside is the tolerence Ive buliding up my doctor put me on Lunesta last night and I do not like it it did not work it makes me feel like garbage all day I want is to go back to my Ambien already
8151,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42849,27,I began taking Ambien years ago I stopped it while I was pregnant with my first child and then ended up going back on it from lack of sleep for so long I took it again first time years before becoming pregnant again and then had to stop it When my youngest son was a year and a half old I started taking it again because I could not sleep longer than an hour When I first started taking Ambien I think the chemical compound was a different because back then I would eat in my sleep cook meals in my sleep but then after going off of it and going back on it I believe the formulation changed I have not had any of those issues for over years Taking it on empty stomach makes a huge difference
8152,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42849,6,I take mg of Zolpidem at night and it works in about minutes I sleep so much better and it does not make me groggy the next day It takes a couple weeks of use to work really well It trains your body to sleep
8153,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42844,27,Ive had chronic insomnia most of my life I took ambien mgs for yrs it helped me so much to lead productive life sleeping at night waking up in the morning with really no bad side effects I dont live in the US anymore and ambien isnt available I think due the bad rap it gets by complainerquots while people like myself who have benefitted from it arent as likely to review a drug they havent had a problem with just human nature Ive tried a whole host of antidepresents amp other sedatives none are as effective and have more side effects than ambien
8154,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42715,19,I a yeard old male was prescribed mg ambien a few weeks ago for insomnia Ive dealt with insomnia for several years Id lie in bed with my eyes closed for hours and would often not sleep for a second Or if I did it was for an hour or and I rarely felt rested Beforehand I tried many sleeping aids Melatonin Belsomra Trazadone and nothing worked Within minutes of taking ambien for the first time I was out like a light and slept hours for the first time in years However Ive been more recently experiencing the problem of not only waking up feeling groggy but feeling that throughout the day Even hours and a significant amount of caffeine later I feel far less attentive than I was when I was sleep deprived
8155,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42713,37,I was prescribed Ambien for insomnia It later became a problem as I continued to build a tolerance for it I am no longer taking and have been off the medicine this week Following are reasons that I stopped taking it I lost my job got arrested picked up a felony charge for prescription fraud among other consequences due to my dependency on the drug In short DO NOT TAKE ANY FORM of Z PILLS I lost a very good job with the government and can no longer return to the job due to Ambien and Lunesta I have a masters degree and still cannot find work due to the felony charge Please take it from me this drug will progressively ruin your life It should be taken off of the market
8157,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,42703,21,I was a body builder and personal trainer active in my career until I got a kidney removed due to a tumor and was diagnosed with hypothyroid at My GP did not wanted to give Ambien instead he prescribed some other medication for psychotic people and I stopped it Another doctor gave the Ambien which I have been taking mg However lately is giving me headaches I wake up a few times at night and cant go back to sleep Feel tired and disconnected I need to stop and I am afraid of the process
8158,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42695,25,I was prescribed Ambien then later Ambien CR for several years for insomnia Wow Just like Id heard about take the pill and minutes later I was out Didnt really experience quothangoverquot the next day but then I allowed myself hours of sleep Then it happened woke up one morning and my kitchen was somewhat of a mess but I didnt remember being up or making tuna salad on toast That happened a few more times before I weaned myself off Ambien Havent had a good nights sleep since Ive been prescribed a few different sleep meds but havent had any success Tried OTC diphenhydramine Benadryl Motrin PM with Melatonin and began not remembering simple words appointments etc
8160,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42693,72,After getting it and reading on the Internet about it I was worried about taking it but you know Internet tends to dramatize thing Been taking it for years now and still works amazingly knocks me out in minutes reliably and keeps me down a good hours Ive never felt hangover effects from it whatsoever In fact its quite the opposite because when youre not used to getting a decent night of rest when you do youre damn right youll feel great Everyone is different and its compatability with you simply has to be tested All the Internet horror stories on this drug are inapplicable for my case My only problem is doctors are very stingy with dealing adequate amounts due to dependancies Yes Im addicted Im addicted to sleep
8161,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42689,2,I tried edluar for insomnia and found that it works very quickly about minutes using the sublingual pill Not a bad taste I prefer it when I need to get to bed quickly It can give u munchies if u try to fight the sleepiness But great for flying or car trips Doesnt always last more than hours but quick onset is worth it Take and go to bed immediately for it to work properly
8162,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42685,20,I overdosed on Ambien Dont remember much of what happened but i wrecked my car got pulled over I do remember waking up at pm thinking it was am and I was late for school thats why I drove I didnt go to the hospital Its weird that I dont remember much like who I talked to or what I said Traumatizing
8165,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42670,30,I took generic ambien not the CR for just two consecutive nights While it does work for putting me to sleep and keeping me asleep I have to say I would not recommend this to people Just take benadryl or Advil PM The reason I say this is because it affected and days later is still affecting my memory I am told by a few friends and coworkers of things I did or said during the daylight hours work hours and I honestly dont remember any of it So for me I wont take this again just because it scares me Im sharp as a tack I remember and observe everything so this really shocked me
8167,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42650,5,NOT A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS THAT I WASNT EXPECTINGTHE SLEEP WALKING ABIT OF A SURPRISEAT FIRST BUT AT LEAST THE DREAMS ARE COOLI space mine out and am taking strict a one or two days a week to avoid any addiction issues
8171,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42633,20,Oh man this stuff works I was on mg for about years My new doctor had me stop cold turkey about years ago I grew a tolerance to it and I was addicted to it My old doctor prescribed it after my mom died when I was I puked after taking my first dose It made me so dizzy it was weird After that first time it never happened again The only side effect was that Id wake up and eat without knowing it I recall my sister saying that I had gotten up and cooked a hamburger ate it and went back to bed without saying a word to her It seems to be a common side effect though It was great help but Im so glad to be off of it for good I take Diphenhydramine to sleep when I need to
8174,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42617,7,I recently too ambien last night amp it worked I finally got sleep amp I slept throughout the night
8176,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42614,16,Ive been on ambient for a year When I first started taking it it work great only thing I would wake up and eat during the night and not know it the next morning I would find the evidence The past week I have got to where its not working like now its am and Im not asleep yet Im on m so wondering if maybe I should ask doc to raise it to Im just afraid if I go up more if it will give me any weird side effects But I cant keep doing this I need sleep
8177,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42613,12,I spent long years with severe insomnia It cost me a long term relationships almost my career and my sanity My doctors tried to get me to take sleeping pills but I resisted I didnt want to become addicted to anything I finally gave in It was the best thing I ever did for my health and well being I credit it for saving my life I take mg every night Sometimes on a Sunday night I may have to take an additional I guess I would be considered addicted but the alternative is something far worse I have suffered depression my whole life and not sleeping for days on end just made the depression worse My depression is in check more than it has ever been
8178,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42608,30,Hands down the very best way to end the day Not only is it the only sleeping pill that worked for me of the dozens of OTC and prescribed sleep aids it felt really good No matter how bad my day was minutes after I took the ambien Id always have a smile and laugh my ass off to Saturday Night Live episodes on Hulu before getting the best and consistent sleep ever Sure my first couple times I had a hangover effect but the next year I was on ambien I ALWAYS felt refreshed the next morning
8180,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,42831,22,I just tried ambien last night for the first time since not getting any more than hrs of sleep and I didnt take the recommended amount of mg I took mg n it worked perfect for me no side affects of being drowsy in the morning nothing slept right through the night and woke up like a new refreshed woman
8183,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42816,10,I have taken Zolpidem mg for years and the generic brand worked okay Recently I changed insurance and had to switch pharmacies Their Zolpidem is made by Teva It doesnt work I have had so many sleepless nights I feel there arent any active ingredients in this brandHas anyone else had a problem with Teva
8184,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,42815,3,I find ambien to take the edge off at night but not make me sleep Im also on seroquel for bipolar and that helps much better for sleep I feel like I took a benadryl when I took ambien
8185,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42814,31,After years of being a zombie I found a psychiatrist who prescribed it for me and I changed into a functioning person Ive never had a bad experience I only take mg a night if I wake up in the middle of the night I never take more and about half the time mg is enough
8186,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42799,34,Im got I just got presrecribed mg ambien for sleep is was probably the best sleeping thing for meds Ive had for insomnia Ive never had any weird experience or others problems either Even though Ive been on it for months now
8188,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,42788,16,I was prescribed mg ambien after months of not getting more than hours of sleep in each hour period I had tried benadryl hydroxyzine and Valium previously all of which kept me wide awake I took the mg right before bed as instructed and laid there awake all night The next night I decided to try mg as I keep reading horror stories about mg I took it waited about minutes then went to bed It took me over an hour to fall asleep but once I did Im thrilled to say I slept all night Unfortunately even after a full night of sleep it was very hard to wake up Id wake up then doze back off That happened several times for about an hour Once I was able to wake up enough to get up I was fine
8189,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,42786,12,My experience with ambien was not very good Ambien is a pretty terrible sleep aid and Im sure youd be better with little sleep and tired Than waking up feeling like crap all day and tired It makes me feel pretty rubbish all day and it only last like hours So Ill wake up or hours later super tired and cant go back to sleep Your body Builds tolerance to this drug very fast After the th or th time of using it its effects are very very minimal Also if you suffer from acid reflex this drug will make it times worse If your desperate for sleep This drug will make you sleep but with great consequences
8190,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,42781,9,I have been on this medication for years I take one mg pill probably times a month I get hours of sleep I have never experienced any side affects I only wish I could get at least hours My new insurance does not cover it without prior authorization More paperworkor phone call for my Doctor
8191,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42775,1,I take mg at night to sleep without them I have to take any other night time medicine but these dont work near as well They do not effect me in the morning and my fianceacute knows not to wake me until at least hours have passed I have had no troubles though he did say Ive been laughing and talking in my sleep
8192,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42761,26,Ambien was very dangerous for me I was prescribed mg for about years One night I took right before bed like I always had and woke up the next morning with vomit all over my house and an empty pill bottle on my night stand I took a heap mg of Ambien and had zero memory of doing this It absolutely terrified me I now take mg of doxepin and sleep through the night without a hangover in the morning Use Ambien with caution If you have any worries please try to find something else
8193,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42760,11,It helped me sleep but only hrs with mg dosage
8194,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42760,7,This drug is my god now Zolpidem bless us all
8196,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42752,3,The first day went well and at days it went very badly I take the pill at pm and gave me a headache and I slept minutes all night and more with itching dry mouth this is not good for everyone

8200,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42736,14,It works great I was prescribed mg but I cut them in half and take mg instead Why I only need to get that tired feeling not to be knocked out like Im getting my wisdom teeth pulled out You take it at night get in bed right after you take it and wait for it to kick in Of course youre going to get dizzy if youre looking at your phone or binge watching on Netflix while its kicking in So dont do that haha If youre afraid that youll get addicted to it I mean come on its not like its xanax And if you are still afraid to take it theres also this thing called quotexercisequot It makes you tired and the worst side effect is losing weight
8201,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42736,25,Ambien is like a little piece of heaven in a pill I have been on Cr since Before this I tried all the others Ambien is the only drug that helps me fall asleep I recommend this drug

8203,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42718,36,On the business class sleeper seat plane to NY the last conscious thing I remember after taking Ambien was my head resting on the pillow about an hour after the meal service and then waking up in bed in the apartment How did I collect my coat and things aware to pack the airline amenity kit and water bottle into the knapsack that was in the overhead bin deplane and walk far to passport control use the passport kiosk that requires me to type in on the touchscreen Thailand and collect the customs print out and then go to a carousel and collect my bag among all the other bags revolving around hand my printout to the customs agent and find where to catch the Newark airport bus in the winter cold How long did I wait for the bus Did I open my suitcase inside the terminal to take out my sweater scarf and wool knit hat to wear all which were packed in the suitcase Upon waking up in the apartment the sweater was on the couch the scarf on a chair and the knit hat in my knapsack Once on the bus I had to have reached in my pocket for my wallet that had my return bus ticket The ticket wasnt in my wallet in the apartment Once off the bus at Port Authority how did I hail a taxi put the stuff in the trunk and tell him where to go My credit card statement indicates I swiped the card to pay for the taxi home Once outside my apartment I had to reach into my knapsack for my keys attached to a clip and open the door The keys were found on the coffee table when woke up in bed My coat and jacket were on the bathroom floor indicating that once inside the apartment I rushed to the bathroom I obviously opened my suitcase as it was found wide open and a of box anticongestion and a bottle of allergy pills that I remember packing in the suitcase in Bangkok were now found on the kitchen counter From remembering my head on the airplane pillow to waking up in my bed everything is a blank hours blank
8204,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42460,18,Ive been taking ambien for over years It helps me sleep and I can sleep hrs and felt like I slept hrs only bad thing is once commit to taking ambien I cant be bothered cuz I wont remember so I usually lock my self down but it is a very helpful drug
8205,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42459,16,Ambien has been hit or miss for me When it works its bliss out of days it doesnt work well The CR is supposed to help me stay asleep but at best I get hours of sleep Its not the greatest sleep I fall off and wake up frequently without feeling Ive slept but its better than staring at the ceiling till dawn Its expensive
8206,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42456,35,Wow I guess Im in the minority because I found that Ambien was completely worthless for me I tried mg mg amp even mg amp never could fall asleep Didnt even feel tired Seriously it was like a sugar pill I dont know why so many people like this stuffI guess my brain is different from everyone elsesstory of my life
8207,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42452,5,I slept drove while taking this medication it ended up in a very bad situation
8209,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42450,15,This medicine works very well for me I take mg of this I am prescribed or at bedtime Before I was taking mg of regular Ambien I would fall asleep rather quickly but I always wake up around or am for the bathroom Then I could never go back to sleep When I went back to my doctor she changed it to the extended release Now when I get up during the night Im able to get back to sleep I always allow myself enough time to sleep off the medication even if it means taking it and going to bed early I allow myself hours I feel rested when I get up and have coffee The only side effect Ive experienced is I sometimes wake myself up talking I would not take this med with nerve pills or drink alcohol
8210,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42447,11,I have chronic insomnia from fibromyalgia and severe back pain Ive been taking the generic Zolpidem XR for years and it always seemed to work For some reason it stopped working for me about months ago I never had any side effect No memory loss sleepwalking or anything else and though always q restless sleeper causing me to wake every time I turn over from the pain I could always fall right back asleep and wake refreshed Not sure what to take now since its lost its efficacy but while it worked it was fabulous Trying Temazepam but its like taking a placebo No effect at all
8211,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42437,8,Very fast acting very effective and does not make you as drowsy the next day Have experienced some dizziness the following day but nothing serious
8212,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42436,17,I was prescribed Ambien following an accident I had at work I couldnt sleep due to extreme pain in lower back Ive been using mg for the past yrs Craziest stuff Ive ever done in my life while on Ambien was order some exercising CDs at am and not remembering the next morning what I had done like I had been in the twilight zone Trying to cancel stuff that I ordered and explain to these telemarketers that Im on medication and dont recall what I even say prompted me to lock my credit cards at night Id rather get hrs of sleep than no sleep at all My lower back pain remains low mild exercise no hot abs for me
8213,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42435,8,Ive been taking ambien generic teva brand for the past years It works best when you take it on an empty stomach meaning no food for a couple hours if you take it with food or after you eat it wont work as well I prefer to break mine into pieces in my mouth I feel it works faster that way Ambien has a very short half life so this medicine is good at getting you to sleep but not necessarily keeping you asleep for more than a few hours When I was really depressed I would take mg to fall asleep then Id wake up hours later being wide awake and Id take the other half
8214,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42419,75,Simple I started taking Ambien in when it was prescribed for me by my orthopedic MD for a swollen knee so I could sleep then I found out it was not habit forming other than psychological I am a professor and I have trouble shutting down my mind at night I have used it daily since that time never have needed more than mg never sleep walk do my best work in the morning at my office before classes have gone a few days when I have run out and am not somewhere I can refill Doesnt worry me I just accept I am not going to sleep well and I dont but I sleep some I dont get anxious about it I am now still teaching full time no sign of weak bones Why on earth would I want to stop taking Ambien
8215,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42411,7,I took ambien on and off for several years My pharmacy just filled and they gave my one made by teva theirs do not work at allAfraid to double on dose
8216,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42409,5,I get very relaxed and tired fall asleep but I sleepwalk out to kitchen and eat Food I also do other things in my sleep but never anything dangerous
8217,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42408,28,I was diagnosed with Chronic Insomnia about months ago Doctor prescribed Ambien It works wonders I discovered that for me once I take it I cannot communicate on any social media websites because the next day when I go back and read what I wrote its a bunch of gibberish My routine I take an Ambien get in the bed and read a little before I know it Im waking up in the morning not realizing I even feel asleep My only issue is the pills are prescribed in bottles of pills one bottle with two additional refills If I dont schedule my follow up Sleep Appointment right Ill be stuck with a few days with no medicine like I am now while typing this lol It is after am and Im WIDE AWAKE
8219,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42406,37,Ive been taking Ambien mg off and on for years It tends to stop working if I start taking it too often so I have to take breaks from it periodically Thats the only negative thing I have to say about it When it works it works perfectly and Ive experienced no side effects
8222,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42400,17,I was admitted to a hospital cardiac care unit following an MI I received Ambien and woke up from sleep profoundly confused and hostile I ripped out of my arms and legs all the IV and EKG leads and then left my bed marching to the double doors of the CCU Female nurses were screaming for I was naked and bloody from the leads being torn away from my bodyThe bravest man I ever met was a young CNA who stepped in front of me telling me quotYou cannot leave the CCUquot Considerably shorter and lighter than me his action was totally courageous given that I was in a temporary druginduced altered mental state I recall only vaguely warning him that I would throw him against the wall if he blocked me I awakened embarrassed ashamed
8224,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42393,32,I have been taking this drug for about years Went in depression anxiety and chronic insomnia I take mg when I do take it and it works very well for me I have never experienced any of the horror stories that others have It immediately improved my mood depression and anxiety as it finally allowed me to sleep I try not to take it more than times a week to avoid dependency on it Sometimes I go weeks without it sometimes weeks straight on it due to situational anxiety
8225,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42391,11,Have had sleep problems last years or so Went to sleep clinic apparently I do not fall into deep sleep stage Doctor put me on Ambien mg Wonderful I slept all night and felt great next day Fast forward months End up being tested for Lupus Lyme disease and bloodwork galore because of muscle and joint pain that would show up in different places and I was suffering EXTREME tiredness and weakness during day All tests negative so doctor wanted me to stop taking Ambien and switched me to trazadone Been a week now So far so good but insomnia is back Will NOT be continuing trazadone Causing excessive pvcs and feels like my heart is going to burst out of my chest Does NOT help me sleep even a little Sad about the Ambien
8226,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42390,2,I have had sleep issues for years and years I took ambien zolidem for a couple years with some success then not Now I will take mg if I am in dire need of a nap or on an airplane I will get hours of sleep on that much med and wake up feeling great Very strange but thats my experience
8227,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42387,4,Suffered from insomnia for ~ years before being prescribed Zolpidem mg It took about minutes to work and it put me to sleep very quickly After ~ week I built up tolerance and my doctor increased my dose to mg before bed This gave me increased side effects seeing double increased drowsiness the morning after I would also dosay things I had no memory of and sometimes I wouldnt be able to tell if what I was remembering was a dream or whether it actually happened Overall it put me to sleep but the side effects were quite severe A very good treatment in the short term but it starts to mess with your sense of reality at higher doses once your tolerance builds up
8228,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42382,12,Ambien definitely puts me to sleep quickly and keeps me asleep However it has made me do crazy things without remembering the next morning I have taken more than the recommended dose while sleep walking cut inches off my hair drove my car many different things I would love this medicine if I just didnt act crazy because it really does work
8229,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42596,30,Ive been taking Ambien for many years The first year I was prescribed mg nightly I had experienced a quotdeep sleepquot and through the entire night For the first time in my life I didnt feel exhausted the next day Then my dosage was changed to mg which was tough My tolerance to the higher dose made it not work My Dr gave me something different to substitute while my body adjusted Its not been years that Ive been taking the mg I also take Adderall XR mg daily and mg of Prozac During the last months Ive had difficulty with memory Being able to recall things I read appointment times things people had said to me I am years old and I understand that comes with age But has anyone had similar problems
8232,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42588,8,I just started this medication and I really enjoy using Ambien because it actually works And quickly But please READ THE SIDE EFFECTS If I dont lay down right after taking it Ill stay up and make phone calls and send texts that I dont remember the next morning So just relax after taking it But other than that it actually works
8234,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42569,13,WARNING take the sideeffects of this med really seriously I had a car accident which shook me up emotionally really badly and I wasnt sleeping So the doc prescribed Ambien which I was somewhat aware of but had never takenFor a little context I am a yearold guy The morning after my third night of taking Ambien I woke up to discover that I had ENROLLED IN COLLEGE I dont know why I dont know why I picked the school I picked but I registered got accepted applied for financial aid the whole thing without intending to nor remembering having done itIt turned out to have been a great thing for me this was two years ago I also NOW know to take Ambien and then LAY THE EFF DOWN dont sit up waiting for it work
8236,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,42558,7,I was given two choices for my insomnia melatonin or ambien as a quick fix Of course I picked the quick fix and went with ambien I took the first night and for minutes after taking read reviews online While reading I noticed my phone screen seemed to move and I lost focus over and over again I thought maybe because I had been up for over hours from the insomnia prior to getting the prescription but upon the second time taking it realized that if you fight the window of time to fall asleep you do get quiet a high Hallucinations do occur occasionally However i was given a two week trial of this drug to see how well it worked for me and as I continue to take it I notice that I fall asleep quickly but wake up throughout nite
8239,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42548,24,A real savior Finally getting some sleep Went off for a month to see if I could sleep without it The answer was no but no other withdrawal symptoms Be sure to give yourself hours and nix the alcohol
8241,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42541,20,I take Ambien Ambien CR and rotate to Lunesta briefly when they build a tolerance Ambien is first rate though They all have an odd effect of not drifting off I blink and wake up in the morning Im ok with that Ambien CR makes me a bit cranky if I wake early like the cat waking me Otherwise they all work and fast like minutes I have a small amount of Ambien CR left which I think is the best but its expensive The others are generic but work ok
8242,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42541,25,I was diagnosed with chronic insomnia when I was currently Im years old Ive been prescribed a great many things to help get me to sleep and more importantly stay asleep Since I want to keep this short Ill just say that ambien is the only one thats worked efficiently for an extended period of time It helps you relax if youre an anxious person like me and surprisingly enough I dont even wake up during the nights like I used to Suppose Ive finally gotten used to the drug or actually getting a good nights rest considering my sleep problems had been around since I was around Anyway works great My does is currently mg every night Probably going to get lowered to mg some time soon
8243,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42528,11,Dont do itafter taking this for about two weeks I found myself becoming suicidal As a veteran with PTSD I highly recommend anybody thats on antidepressants or antipsychotics to stay away from this prescription
8244,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42528,23,Ive had every sleeping medicine even test drugs thats legal where I am but only ambien has let me sleep Ive been on ambien for about years now I take it because my autonomic nervous system doesnt work properly and my adrenaline wont shut of to let me sleep Though ambien is the only thing that lets me sleep it does give me weird trips or hallucinations sometimes Which I have been told isnt a good thing and you should stop if you hallucinate or have a bad trip but Im on mg of ambien and I fall asleep of the time so thanks ambien
8245,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42519,32,I have been a longhaul flight attendant for over years and have used this drug since its release I find it EXTREMELY effective with no side effects for me whatsoever I will say that like a lot of sleep aids and sleeping tablets its continued use does cause a psychological dependancy and the effectiveness of the drug becomes less and less Therefore I would recommend not using the drug every night and alternating it with other sleep therapies
8246,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42491,16,My psychiatrist prescribed me mg of Ambien to help with insomnia I take it nights a week typically and found it very helpful in the beginning Now I can take it and not feel a thing I have considered asking my psychiatrist for a slightly higher dosage
8247,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42488,6,Ive always had issues falling asleep so I started taking this pill a couple months or a year ago The first month or two it helped me fall asleep and wake up early simple as that no problems After a while I started to build up a tolerance I guess and I couldnt really fall asleep when I took it If I unintentionally stayed up for more than ~ hours after I took the pill I would start getting weird side effects Like I felt like I was going crazy The worst was when I was trying to sleep it felt like ghost hands were touching my body or somethingcrazyI know In addition I would find my self looking at weird shit on the internet or thinking strange thoughts Most of the time I took the pill I would have gaps in my memory
8248,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42482,26,I have had a great experience with this medicine I sleep through the night on it wake up rested and free of any hangover and it doesnt knock me out like benedryl does I feel like I get a natural sleep Ive never experienced the night time issues that some have mentioned and have never experienced nightmares or vivid dreams as I have with other medicines
8251,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42480,25,It works and its ability hasnt diminished with use or time I can get to sleep every single time I take this drug and it always only takes pills That is a lot more than I can say for any sleep drug Ive ever taken The downside is that if I dont go to sleep as soon as I feel it kick in I will do some very very strange things that I can only slightly remember if I remember at all
8252,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42477,4,Do NOT drive after taking Zopiclone You get several second blackouts constantly Highly hazardious to do anything that could be dangerious after taking Also I recommend not drinking alcohol at all when taking heart might punch out of beat and skips or beats out of rhythm That is with the tablets and half a bottle of wine Serious drug but works for the purpose
8253,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42474,21,I took Ambien awhile back for insomnia Within minutes I was out Woke up refreshed after hours Caution for me it was addicting and I could not sleep without it Also for me I would not remember activities I may or may not have done the night before Unplug your phone you may regret who you call and the conversation you had I cannot take Ambien for those reasons but it did work for getting to sleep
8254,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42292,28,I have been taking Ambien for almost yr now and find it to work just well I sleep for almost hrs but it takes almost hrs to kick in for me I take it when in bed because once its in and the effect takes in I fall right asleep and dont remember what time I fell asleep I wake up right when my alarm goes off or if I need to use the restroom I dont wake up groggy and feel pretty great about my day everyone I believe would like to sleep in more but hrs is good for me I have horrible insomnia which keeps me up all night until about am then maybe fall asleep fr being a zombie Ambien definitely helps quot mequot but yes on a empty stomach is a must it else I can just say I wasted a pill Good luck with your experiences
8255,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42291,6,Best meds for sleeping Does not leave me groggy in the morning
8256,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42289,8,I was on Zolpidem for around a month It does make me go to sleep and is great for shortterm use However you can become psychologically dependent on it I started looking forward to my nightly fix and would feel panicky if I my supply was running low It got to the point only mg could make me sleep mg did nothing for me and Im a very petite lady It was very difficult to come off it Ive been off Zolpidem for nearly two months I sleep naturally but my sleep isnt as good as it was before ie I wake up several times throughout the night I dont know if this is an effect of monthlong Zolpidem use So in a nutshell great for shortterm use but longterm causes extreme dependency
8257,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42288,2,Northstar generic out of better off taking benadryl
8258,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42281,31,I have taken Ambein for about years never wake up tired or groggy Stay asleep for a good hours Best sleep med I have taken
8260,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42279,27,Took ambien for the first time last night after not sleeping all night for months I didnt want to wake up late or groggy This worked wonders Took at ish just woke up at So happy I didnt sleep in but also got a full nights rest Now lets hope I didnt do anything weird
8261,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,42279,11,I have been on Ambien for almost a month now This drug works maybe a mins later but I do not stay sleep It gives me maybe a good hours of rest Im tired throughout the day but still cant fall asleep when I get home
8262,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,42265,24,I have been taking mg of Ambien for quite a while It has however been making me wake up every hour on the hour and I eat and eat through out the night Years ago I took Ambien and I would wake up and I would find crumbs in the bed and would not remember even eating anything Lets just say I gain unneeded weight I told my psychiatrist today that I want to stop taking it and that I wish to wean myself off of it and she told me to just do it You dont have to worry about weaning it Your on such a small dosequot On every thing I have ever read and learned I am a RN you wean yourself off of any medicine So I am going to wean myself off of the AmbienThanks for reading
8263,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42264,10,I kept waking up
8264,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42264,28,I personally have not taken this medication but my mother has I am and she started taking it when I was It for the most part helped her insomnia but the side effects were extreme I would have to stay up until she had fallen asleep because if I didnt she would do things and not remember them the next morning She would take our dog for a walk in the dark at at night by herself There was one occasion where she woke up on our neighbors cement front porch with our dog She had no recollection of how she got there She would eat strange things like vineager and ketchup chicken quesadillas she would fall down the stairs she would lose things and she got very addicted Coming off it was horrible The night terrors were insane
8265,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42264,4,I have tried everything to get to sleep and nothing worked my mind cant turn off until I got this I take mg and sleep like a baby with No side effects what so ever Its a god send for me
8266,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42264,19,I was prescribed this mg to help me sleep No other medication or remedy worked Since Ive taken this I have got the best sleep of my life About mins after taking the pill I already start feeling loopy and tired The only downside is that I wake up with a drug hangover and feel a little off for a few hours but thats far better than being grouchy and sleep deprived
8268,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42263,24,Wow is all I can sayWithin minutes I could feel the effects of the AmbienWithin minutes of my head hitting my pillow I was out like a damn light I only woke up once in the middle of the nightand that was because my husband was moving around on the bedBut I went right back to sleepThis stuff has given me the best sleep Ive had in WEEKS Thank you
8269,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42254,2,Works fine with mg tizanidine Without the muscle relaxer it puts me into a groggy euphoric state and I still cant sleep
8270,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42246,41,I experience insomnia in that my mind often does not quotturn offquot I tend to keep thinking once I lay down in bed Over the counter sleep aids have been ineffective and leave me drowsy the day after Ambien turns off my mind and I sleep well Sometimes I wake up in about to hours if I need a bit more sleep then I take a half pill mg for the remaining two extra hours of sleep that I need to feel well rested I have had no side effects
8271,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42241,18,I wrote earlier but wanted to add something about pumpkin seed oil I have pelvic floor dysfunction from a hysterectomy and my bladder plus IBS wakes me up all night every hours or so Since Ive been taking pumpkin seed oil an organic brand a little over a teaspoon I sleep much better I hope to get off the Ambien eventually and just use the a Sleep Aid and the pumpkins seed oil
8272,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42238,39,I take or mg depending on the day I love this med it shuts my mind off so i can sleep Ive tried cutting out caffeine using allergy meds herbal type sleep aides and Tylenol pmthe crap doesnt work Ambien is only thing thats worked and Ive never done anything dangerous or weird on it
8273,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42236,20,This drug will knock you out for sure but it has some really crazy side effects that I didnt think would actually happen to me mainly doing stuff that I dont remember at all one night I made an extremely hefty online purchase and had no recollection of it I also quotdrunk textquot on Ambien or otherwise say things verbally to people that I dont remember This has happened a number of times and actually caused a lot of problems in my last relationship Ive woken up literally covered in food It also worsened my depression Not a great experience
8274,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42233,33,LOVE IT I have never had a side effect and look forward to bed which I no longer dread I cut mg in half and if wakeup and cant get back to sleep take other half Highly recommend
8275,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42231,13,Ambien was not the drug for me There were mental side effects that caused me to being depressed and confusion about life interests I was in the emergency room times in one weekend after months of taking ambien prescribed by my doctor to help me sleep I will never take this drug again
8276,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,42224,23,I have been taking ambien for a month and a half It does eventually help me to fall asleep but it comes with a couple of side effects One of those side effect is I get very loopy and weird Also I do not remember anything when I wake up from the time after I take ambien I probably will not remember writing this review
8278,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42208,5,Been taking the mg until it got discontinued and now have the mg I take a whole mg with a half mg and this works perfectly for me I havent had any weird side effects and have been on this med for years I take it on a totally empty stomach and after about minutes I have a snack before bed if I happened to have missed dinner After snack off to bed Ambien is my best friend I am in my late s
8279,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42381,4,I was prescribed this drug in my early teen years and it worked wonders at first Not at years old it doesnt work AT ALL I will sometimes have to take pills at night and I will still wake up hours later I guess I built up a tolerance but I will be switching medicines Plus I would find myself in the kitchen eating every night and one had a blender out about to make margaritas This is definitely not a long term drug
8280,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42380,2,Ive just took zopiderm mg about hour and half ago mouth feels a bit dry I still dont feel very sleepy I will let know the outcome tomorrow Thanks
8281,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,42377,10,Ive tried many sleep aids Im currently taking a generic AMBIENCR mg I had previously used both Brand name and generic versions of AMBIEN mg Im disappointed with AMBIEN amp AMBIENCR Ive read horror stories of blackouts falling into deep sleep within minutes of ingesting and even that the dose requirements have been reduced Despite the alleged powerful effects of AMBIEN and AMBIENCR I find it to be modestly effective for sleep Regular immediaterelease AMBIEN mg would only help me sleep for hours
8282,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42376,6,This drug is fine if not manufactured by Teva Teva is not a good company and this drug has no effect under them Save your money
8285,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42365,37,You can do things and not remember them You will tell awful stories about squirrels jumping out of glass boxes and say things to your spousesignificant other you dont mean if you try to TALK while on this drug So by all means do not take until the very last thing before sleep ie you are in bed ready for sleep It kicks in super fast and you wont know what hit you You only get to hours of sleep on Ambien but you feel rested with no druggie zombie after feeling Note to single parents taking this drug you will be worthless in an emergency situation and helpless to assist your children in a fire a breakin a trip to the ER at am never drive on this drug
8286,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42358,18,I have severe insomnia and Ambien CR has worked very well for me Previously I tried the Ambien IR and while it did knock me out for a good hours it didnt help me to stay asleep and the Ambien CR does just that My only complaint is some days I seem to very drowsy and sluggish but most of the time I wake up feeling refreshed and ready tackle the day
8287,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42356,16,I was prescribed this by my doctor as a result of being bipolar and being up for days on end Ambien is definitely a tremendous sleep inducer After a few minutes you wouldnt know if you were dead or alive I was probably on mg for about a year When I was on a bipolar quothighquot I could three pills and only sleep a couple of hours I often felt groggy or drugged the next day using this product I quit taking this product as a result of weird and unexplained behavior One time I woke up with no clothes on and couldnt find them I never slept naked bcuz I was single and had a year old Scary stuff u dont know what ur doing on this stuff
8288,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42353,23,Taking ambien as exactly prescribed has been a tremendous help to me I get sleep without waking up several times a night I feel refreshed for a day of anything
8291,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42348,9,I was put on Ambien because of my anxiety and depression I wasnt able to sleep more than an hour or a night I took the Ambien mg for about a week and I had horrible indigestion the whole time and on top of that I still only slept hours a night tops And I have been off them for almost a week and Im still having horrible stomach pains and possibly a swollen liver
8292,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42341,12,Ive been in this medication since to Ive been on it and off from it but I will warn people with diagnosed depression or PTSD not to take it too long Ive gone from stripping my clothes off and thinking I was going to bed Munchies galore Ate a whole cake without blinking Bad idea since my cholesterol is sky high list goes on I asked several Drs if overeating was a side effect Led to believe it was only me Burned half my arm cooking and only said quotOuch I burned my armquot Went to bed and had to get treated for the burn It left a scar Every time I take it my depression escalates even with antidepressants I seriously saw dead people and spoke to them Relayed exactly what they wore and said to my kids Bad reactions
8294,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42330,5,I divide a Zolpidem mg tablet into four section with pill silcer I disolve one section on my tongue to fall alseep If I wake up in a few hours I take another section and disolves it on my tongue I usually need to urinte at twice a night and asily fall back to sleep with the small dose If I wake up and its am Ill take the last of the four sections I cut Ill wake up again between and AM Ive never had any side effects from this drug I feel well rested and do not need to take a nap during the day Ive been taking a for of Ambien for years Im now a senior citizen and my insurance will only pay for days of use a year I use Good Rx coupons
8295,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42329,3,I have been taking ambienzolpidem for several years now and have always had great sleep But since my pharmacy has taken to using the Mylan generic all that has changed It has caused night time binging relentless picking at sores in sleep hours awake in the middle of the night Id been taking mg but with this generic I find I often need to take another mg to sleep My sleep has been disruptive almost every night I used to think ambienzolpidem was the greatest help Now Ive asked my doctor for a different sleep aid
8296,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42322,14,I have been prescribed Ambien for years now I used to take Xanax along with it so I never truly got to experience the hypnotic effects of Ambien on its own Now I take it by itself and its a powerful medication It can cause my appetite to get out of control also I had a major problem when I drank alcohol with it My parents came home to find me putting all my clothes in a suitcase I found somewhere in the house a loaf of sliced bread spread all over the house and the yard and me yelling at them for making my friends leave the game early what the hell I was doing or talking about I still have no idea So yes dont drink and take Ambien in the course of a night because it leads to some bizarre activities But all in all as a sleep aid its great
8297,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42317,14,I was dealing with severe insomnia for a few months Dr prescribed mg It helped me fall asleep noticably quicker No sleepwalking or anything but then one night my work woke me after an hour or so and I was slightly impaired stumbling through bedroom and slurring words Felt like being drunk except that my mind was still fine just body delayed Otherwise it has been free of side effects and gets job done except for heartburn Experience it nightly after taking ambien and take an antacids
8298,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42315,26,I have been taking ambien or zolphidem for almost years I had horrible insomnia where I couldnt sleep sometimes at all during the night The insomnia went on for about years before I tried ambien it worked immediately I dont take it every night and when I do I break off a third of the pill The only side effect is sometimes grogginess in the morning I worry about a little memory loss I was told it disrupts your REM sleep which can affect memory Trying to get off completely but dont want to go through that horrible insomnia again
8300,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42305,8,I have tried every sleep medicine known to man to get to sleep Melatonin gave me horrendous nightmares as did the over the counter sleep stuff so I had to take Tylenol PMs and Simply Sleeps When I realized I was taking of simply sleeps and of the Unisoms and only getting hours I knew there was a problemI took this version after trying other versions of it and I slept for a nice hours solid Like I was turned off and then back on again No aches no pains Hopefully I can keep on this Great stuff
8302,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42296,9,I first started taking mg and it didnt work then I started taking one and a half and it started working My doctor prescribed this in the beginning and I had some side effects I was ordering things online talking on the phone and I didnt remember things I was saying I was getting up in the middle of night eating I had out of body experience amp hallucinations but my doctor said it has to be in your system to work Just recently my family told me I got up sleepwalking unfortunately I still take the medication because I am unable to sleep without it but it does work You have to turn off all your TVs and lights and go lay down in the dark no reading books no getting on your tablet or phone and you will go straight to sleep and have a nice good seven to eight hours of rest
8303,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42295,12,Knocked out within minutes Woke up hours later lights still on and found my book on the floor The next day I had memory loss and felt confused I tried them times with the same experience than I returned them to the pharmacy Maybe I
8304,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,42089,31,I went from working nights pmam to working am I would keep thinking all night and I couldnt shut my brain off I have always had problems with insomnia so much so that some times I would stay up for days at a time I was prescribed Ambien by my doctor and I started taking it at night It worked The first time I took it I started hallucinating I saw two of everything and I couldnt hold my head up I woke up and felt fine So I kept taking it Slowly I started getting very sad as I woke up I thought about doing terrible things to myself After being awake for a couple hours I was fine This drug made me very depressed I never abused this medication I was very careful Effects are different for everyone
8306,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,42084,22,This medicine helped me to fall asleep after a solid week without sleep However I did not stay asleep Going to try Lunesta tonight
8309,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42036,75,I have been taking Ambien every night for a over years I am a nurse and its very difficult to work swing shift and teach yourself to sleep whenever esp if you suffer from insomnia I have had insomnia since a child probably sleep walking Sleep eating prior to taking the medicine Now that I have it my life has improved percent No one can imaging how disturbing it is to lie in bed for hours wide awake knowing you have work soon When I first took it I was groggy in the morning but now as long as I get hours I wake up feeling awake and amazing never grew a tolerance for it Always works I will say when I had children under I would never take it not safe when you are caring for others this med saved me
8310,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42028,14,Truly the only thing bar Mirtazapine at one point that has ever worked for my severe sometimes up entire nights in a row and chronic insomnia nearly a decade It doesnt make me as drowsy in the morning as Mirtazapine which is great because then I can have a more normal sleeping pattern I do have some really weird kind of scary side effects including minor hallucinations like stuff moving round the room person on a poster looked like they were dancing face shapes in curtains swaying etc and feeling a bit high However even with these side effects it is still worth it if nothing else has worked
8311,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42025,52,It works to put me asleep too well I was told by my husband that I was doing stuff I dont remember doing One time I became sexually aggressive and last night I didnt recognize my husband and was doing stuff totally off the wall I will not be taking it again
8312,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42025,17,This medication has been extremely effective for me with minimal side effects but I must have time for at least hours of sleep
8313,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,42017,44,Ditto on rebound sleepless when discontinued I have done very strange things with no memory including taking additional Ambien It has helped me sleep when under extreme stress but watch out Now I am trying to learn how to sleep naturally
8314,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,42013,46,Works splendidly when first prescribed but over time loses its effectiveness and one develops a tolerance to its effectiveness Due to its short halflife in the body it peters out quite quickly hours Would not recommend longterm treatment with this medicine gt months
8315,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42002,11,I have used it on and off for years It works SO fast Get in bed then spray itDownside is that it tastes really bad but the taste is gone if you drink water afterwards It also is very useful for traveling and plane rides that are over hrs It is approved if you only can get hours of sleep So sometimes when I fly I will spray this and sleep for my hr plane ride
8317,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41993,60,Extremely effective until I developed a tolerance Unfortunately it was accompanied by quotsleepshoppingquot on Ebay
8320,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41977,91,Ambien works Not because its a sleep aid but because its a HYPNOTIC Which means if you dont want amnesia then get yourself straight to bed after taking it It kicks in in mins and may or may not keep you asleep all nightBut those of you complaining of eating etc and having no memory of what you did is very simple taking a HYPNOTIC while youre still up and showering or whatever is going to make you do stupid things you wont remember Just take it AFTER you lay down turn off your phone and youll be fine
8321,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41976,9,I have had insomnia for about years I took temazepam Restoril for about years but it eventually quit working entirely so I started taking mg of zolpidem nightly about months ago It is very good at helping me to go to sleep quickly and I stay asleep about hours but not much longer I havent felt any drowsiness the next morning or had any headaches or other side effects I have learned a few things about zolpidem though I cannot eat at all for at least or hours before taking it Also I need to go to bed within or minutes after taking it or it doesnt work very well Lastly I learned that I cant eat chocolate for at least or hours before taking it because of chocolates high caffeine content
8324,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,41942,46,Stayed up all night
8325,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,41940,35,Yes you will sleep But you will also say and do some really weird things
8326,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41930,15,I suffer with sleep duration insomnia Mostly I fall asleep naturally for two hours then perhaps drop off naturally once more for an hour after that I wake and cannot fall asleep without zolpidem The insomnia seems to be caused by general anxiety and a mind that will not stop holding internal conversations even when I am exhausted I take xmg zolpidem which at best gives three hours sleep I repeat this at least once over the night Its been like this for some years with no side effects tolerance addiction or rebound insomnia noticeable Overall this is the best sedative for me as it leaves no drowsiness the next day My wish would be for a longer sedative action
8327,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,41917,47,I have been known to fix a meal send texts and emails while still asleep I have also had phone conversations and not remembered having them on waking
8328,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,41907,35,Some nights after taking the zolpidem I go right to sleep and have sound restful sleep for about hrs Twice during my current bout of insomnia I have slept a full hrs after taking the zolpidem I have had some positive experience and some negative However I have bouts of insomnia once or twice a year the past Zolpidem is worked really well within few nights I am not on week four of the insomnia and three on the Zolpidem I am working closely with my doctor
8329,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,42201,38,Take it on an empty stomach or it wont work I have terrible insomnia and have been on it longterm It still works after years It had some initial side effects but they went away after a few months It works very well but I gave it eight stars only because you have to take on an empty stomach If I eat a late dinner I can count on it not working Otherwise its the only medication that has helped me sleep I take mg per night
8331,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42178,55,Be aware take this medication and immediately lay down the first night I took this medication I was up apparently I dont remember so I was told serving myself a shot eating requested weird sexual favorsand was having conversations and answering myselfand had no memory of all these fun festivies the next daylolthanks ambienlesson learned my boyfriend had a blast though
8333,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,42169,6,Have had sleep issues for yrs yrs old male Sober yrs was prescribed mg at first but was made aware that it could be addictive Was desperate Have been taking mg nightly for three months Seems to help a lot but learned quickly not to be on the phone etc after taking the drug one hour later Say stupid things and do not remember
8336,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42163,31,Ive been taking this medication on and off for over years and it has worked wonderfully Just a third or half of a mg pill works for me I have not experienced any side effects but do go right to bed once I take the pill
8337,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42161,54,Ive had chronic insomnia clinical diagnosis sleep studies neurologists etc for over years starting in high school and gradually getting worse over the decades No drugs aside from powerful depressants barbits benzos tranquilizers etc had helped me at all Ambien CR has been a miracle medication for me My insomnia is so constant and severe I literally wont sleep a single minute some nights that my Dr lets me take it every night Many people talk about the possible sideeffects of longterm usage but that ignores the very definite effects of chronic insomnia I have no nextday sideeffects but I will have rebound insomnia if I stop Taking with a glass of water helps for me so does good sleep hygiene rules
8339,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42159,13,Ive experienced years of chronic sleep and anxiety disorders Zolpidem quotAmbienquot will not quotknock you outquot or reduce anxiety levels instead it creates hypnotic effects that have caused me further issues with uncharacteristic night terrors and black outs As per the warning label do NOT try to drive operate heavy machinery while using this medication
8340,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42143,57,I love this stuff Its improved my quality of life immensely I used to wake up in the middle of the night and couldnt go back to sleep I now take mg at bedtime and I still wake up after about hours but then take another mg I cut the pill in half and fall right back asleep for another to hours Ive been taking it for years now and still works as good today as the first day I took it
8341,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42142,26,Wow If you are taking this med take and lay down and close your eyes You will say and do things and not remember a thing For real
8342,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,42140,25,Oh my gosh Started taking this for shift work years ago and now its the only way I can sleep only I dont any more I went thru the hallucinations the binge eating the quotoh my God I bought what on ebay last nightquot To waking up in some unusual places not knowing how I got there It takes you through the coaster ride but the thrill is gone Fitful nights not more than solid hours any more Im trying belsomra tomorrow night Side effects sound scary but so did ambien when I first heard about it Not a cure all and its only worth praising the st year or Sucks when your sleep never comes
8343,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,42130,29,My father who has a neurological disorder was taking ambien and my family had terrifying experiences The first time my dad got up and fell several times and was completly unresponsive he could not speak and we had thought that he had a stroke Next time he took it I woke up in the middle of the night to a huge bang finding him in the kitchen with a gash on his forehead The even scarier thing is he never recalled any of these things Im not sure on the dosage but I dont recommend to anyone
8344,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42126,8,My son who is years was given this medication and it worked very well with Seroquel mg at night This has saved the life of our family Such a beautiful thing to see my very hyperactive son sleeping deeply
8345,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42122,66,Helps put my mind in a blank slate My mind is constantly running all the time everyday When nighttime approaches I cant shut my mind off I have a fear of initially sleeping I also use it for nights of when I have really bad anxiety depression or panic It calms me down and soothes me I no longer have any worries It helps me get to sleep easy and really sedates me I love those aspects
8346,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42120,38,I was in a horrible car crash Sept th I was air cared to UC I was in ICU for days and remained hospitalized months I never used to have trouble going to sleep but since my accident I will lay in bed hours on really bad nights sometimes its all night with my eyes closed trying to fall asleep but I just cant I believe being on a dilaudid drip for so long during my hospital stay then morphine and oxycodone for a while plays a big role in my sudden insomnia also I was diagnosed with GAD years ago which Im sure sometimes adds to my trouble sleeping ZzzQuil or Benadryl helped some at first but now neither help at all Finally was given Zolpidem mg and I LOVE it I fall asleep and sleep all night Definitely recommend it
8350,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,42105,43,Awesome I have terrible insomnia This helps me get a decent nights rest as I care for a disabled parentbedbownd and wheelchair I get a good nights sleep and both of our days are more productive
8351,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,42098,43,This is the only thing that I have tried that helps me sleep a full hours I love this medication I have had no sleep walking and I have not done anything that I cant remember The only side effects I have had are just feeling a little tired during the day and increased appetite I would definitely recommend this medication to people with insomnia

8355,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,41892,6,I was prescribed this for insomnia First night it worked well After that I only got a few hours sleep which is what I got before taking it The side effects were horrible Nervousness trouble urinating constipation and chills Ill stick with OTC medication They do as well without the side effects
8356,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,41890,58,It helped me sleep but I did the most bizarre things while I should have been sleeping and had no memory of them the next day I initiated sex with my husband twice and had no memory of doing so called and order things that I had no use for to some shopping networks and even gave out my credit card numbers to open an account This stuff scares me and I quit taking it Worried what I could do next

8362,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41789,12,I have always had sleep problems even as a kid Sometimes it was bad sometimes it wasnt Developed severe insomnia after getting off Duragesic patches for fibromyalgia the doctor didnt bring me off wisely Have been on zolpidem for about weeks It works great but occasionally I have a weird dream usually the same one I also slobber alot But I get so much better sleep I feel better than I have in about five years The only downside is that my reading has taken a hit since I go to sleep quickly and dont wake up during the middle of the night I do want to get off the medicine if I can but the three days I stayed awake coming off the Duragesic was a nightmare that I would like to avoid again Im not young anymore
8363,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,41788,25,This medication made me feel as though I could not breathe I was up all night I took it at pm and went straight to bed I began having the hot flush feeling and felt as I had pressure on my chest I have been taking the mg but wake up in hours This was a living nightmare taking the CR If you have any respiratory issues do not take

8367,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41717,63,I was never able to sleep through the night until my doctor prescribed Ambien
8369,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,41710,53,Works fine but the rebound insomnia can be awful Used sparingly it can be a useful medicine Once again watch for the rebound insomnia

8376,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41649,65,Ive been taking Ambien for about years now due to chronic insomnia Multiple medical issues have caused most of the problem with not sleeping I already have fusions in my neck one of which is falling apart and causing a compressed spinal cord that my NS is trying to avoid further surgery on so that I dont have to have rods in addition to the screws and plates that are already in there plus I have laminectomy from L to S with bulging discs fibromyalgia bone on bone arthritis in both knees and I also need both hips replaced Oh there are also a couple of bulging discs and bone spurs in my cervical spine in addition to the problems already mentioned I have never had any side effects or trouble with the Ambien at all
8377,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41649,48,I have fibromyalgia so I wake up in pain this allows me to rest
8378,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41646,16,Zolpidem provides a fabulous alternative med for sleep to OTCs over the counters Its a relaxing but also effective means of quickly falling asleepIf only the scientists could modify the meds so zolpidem does NOT cause next day grogginess amp drowsiness in susceptible individuals Thank you
8380,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,41595,67,This medicine works to get me to sleep and stay asleep HOWEVER I quickly become dependent on it and cant get to sleep without it so I cant take it as needed Also I noticed that I seem to need larger doses rapidly My insomnia issues are generally manageable if I avoid caffeine and dont eat too close to bedtime
8381,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41586,36,Wonderful medication
8382,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41579,27,Ambien CR works for me but for some reason I cant take the generic Negates my antidepressant doctor has tried me on different anitdepressants amp does it on all of them Has anyone else had this problem Very weird
8383,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41573,41,It truly works great I am so happy that my doctor prescribed it for me for my insomnia

8385,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,41569,17,Hi year old female with chronic pain amp insomnia For whatever reason Ambien worked for me quite well a decade ago Today it no longer works I even had a DNA rest done to see if I metabolize this medicine differently but it was quotnormalquot I do not go into a deep sleep ever Rather I take many quotnapsquot constantly dreamingmeaning I never get out of REM so Im constantly exhausted I too have tried every other product on the market prescription to no avail Ten years ago Id have given it a solid Best wishes to all of you who suffer from this horrible condition especially those with other conditions Lack of sleep certainly exacerbates what youre body is already dealing with Good luck
8386,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,41553,3,Dont keep me asleep and have weird dream with this medication
8387,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41552,10,Some nights it works great others not so much but overall one of the best sleep aids
8388,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41552,59,I have many incurable diseases that are very painful One of those is called Fibromyalgia When you have Fibromyalgia you rarelyif ever go to Stage sleep Without Ambien I can be awake for days In pain exhausted crying and not able to sleepI have been on all OTC medications for sleep I have also tried Ambien CR which for some reason doesnt work at all for me Lunesta Sonata and chloral hydrate For those who dont know Chloral Hydrate is VERY strong None of those worked Ambien does
8390,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41534,52,I have taken this in addition to Benadryl for the last five years and noticed that it seems to work within or minutes as opposed to Benadryl which takes about an hour The problem is if you take it too early before going to bed you may miss the window period and lie awake in bed restless Ive never had any of the adverse side effects like weird dreams or sleepwalking but it also seems to wake me up eight hours after taking it regardless of the time Its probably the best as needed medicine for insomnia but would not recommend of an everyday basis
8391,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41523,41,I work at a bar Last night was the first night I started Ambien and I fell right to sleep woke up early went for a jog I feel amazing
8394,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41506,49,Ambien is the best ever
8395,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,41495,34,Ambien CR is my most recent attempt to circumvent my chronic insomnia After taking it I go directly to bed It typically takes an hour or more to have any affect I will get hours of restful slumber before I wake Going back to Klonopin amp Lunesta
8399,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41491,4,I travel both domestically and internationally quite a bit Zolpidem helps me reset my body clock when Im dealing with jet lag Usually a take it for nights until my body clock syncs Never had any adverse reaction The first day though it seems like Im a little slow to get going but I attribute that to the variation of the body clock to the silly clock on the side table Highly recommend for this purpose
8400,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41489,4,Been using Zolpidem several years now of a mg tablet when required Stayed at that dose for a couple years until began waking up after hours Began taking just a small pinch more to get back to sleep Recently I found myself taking s pill at bedtime and though Ive never had any bizarre behavior on it have been noting memory and mood changes as Ive aged past which I was attributing to normal aging andor my thyroid disorder However after carelessly downing an entire mg pill last night I woke this morning feeling very groggy foggy headed and my vision was blurry Sweet dreams
8401,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41486,55,I love it I am a very restless sleeper wake up almost every single hour then have a hard time falling back to sleep The only time I could sleep through the night is if I drank a load of alcohol Well first I started out with half of a mg Ambien just to see how it would affect me I slept a solid hours woke up but it didnt bother me I didnt get all upset because I woke up and I easily fell back to sleep So even MG took the edge off for me It depends on how good I want to sleep as to how much Ambien I take last night I took mg and slept a solid hours got up went to the bathroom slept another hours I dont have all the weird side effects I feel like a whole new person taking this medication
8402,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41482,34,I have had on and off insomnia since I was a teenager For almost years I took an OTC sleeping pill and it worked fine Last winter I suddenly could not fall asleep with anything I took I tried everything possible but I wouldnt fall asleep until or am I would go into work feeling like I was hit by a truck I spoke to my doctor and she said that I might be suffering from depression which is why I wasnt sleeping Tried trazadone but it never helped me sleep I would have severe dry mouth wouldnt fall asleep most nights and it caused me to have weird side effects I went back to the doctor and she gave me mg Ambien It has helped me tremendously I do not have the side effects people talk about
8403,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41467,3,Been taking mg and break part off probably about puts me asleep almost immediately for at least or hours
8405,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41463,58,I take less than mg about of a pill very nearly every night for years I have had no side effects
8406,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,41450,38,Worked great for first few times but started to dissipate until it stopped working altogether
8409,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41443,11,Due to high anxiety I would stay awake anywhere between hours After Tylenol PM failed miserably my doctor put me on Ambien Not only does it put me to sleep it also calms the anxiety down very very well I will take it and within min be feeling alot better I have had insomnia for years After taking it I feel a little funny in the head and my vision messes up a little but thats it Nothing bad at all If it wasnt for Ambien I would not know what a good nights sleep is I take the mg I highly recommend it
8411,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41440,16,I had a real rough time falling asleep so my doc prescribed Ambien It worked tremendously but after days I experienced finger joint pain by the th day wrist and finger joint paint was excessive I will stop using and hope the pain goes away
8412,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,41422,32,My doctor took me off Trazodone due to sexual problems I started taking Ambien about days ago The first day I was a zombie and had major amnesia problems My son videotaped how crazy I was acting I didnt know you had to lie down and take it I took it the next night while in bed and was wired Only got minutes of sleep before work I am ADHD so that may have had something to do with it I will give it a couple more nights before I give up on it
8413,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41420,7,This medicine has given me a new life by allowing me a good nights sleep
8415,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41414,46,I suffer from both sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia My doctor recommended that I take mg half a dose of Ambien prior to bedtime In terms of overriding sleep onset insomnia this product is excellent It also does a good job of keeping me asleep throughout the night however I still wake up approximately five to six hours later My ideal amount of sleep is seven to eight hours Still getting six hours of uninterrupted sleep is preferable to eight hours of fitful sleeping Its also worth mentioning that Ambien doesnt leave me feeling groggy in the morningUnlike some of the other reviewers here I havent experienced any of the more pernicious negative sideeffects eg the various somnambulist activities
8416,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41405,6,Before zolpidem I used to take Motrins and Benadryls to fall asleep I love it Lunesta just was too expensive and didnt work for me as well Thanks for reading
8417,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41391,35,First time in a LONG time I have gone to bed without worrying about if I was going to be able to sleep then I didnt have to lay there trying it just happened I woke up refreshed which was a surprise because it is normally a minute battle to get up in the morning
8418,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41389,53,I fell asleep as soon as the pill kicked in and was out like a lamp for the rest of the night
8419,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41387,29,Since I was a teenager I have been struggling with Insomnia So I was sent to a Psychiatrist who was fairly old So as he prescribed Xanax and Valium for me in the day time He gave me Amytal amobarbital mg Capsules for insomnia These work more than you can believe However as there wasnt a huge demand for it it was taken off the market and I was put on Restoril mg x didnt work Ambien in my opinion is the best they have on the market right now
8420,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41373,35,My experience was great like a Valium Im feeling excellent and I know I will have a great night Thanks Ambien
8421,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41357,62,Been taking this for years The only thing that has worked for me I can stay up all night without it I have learned you have to go to bed hungry that way it has nothing to compete with in your stomach No side affects the next morning Get about to hrs now which is good for me Now if my insurance would pay for this Just got new insurance this year and they consider this a tier medication Dont know which is worse Going broke or not getting any sleep
8422,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41356,56,Works amazing I have horrible anxiety and panic attacks which causes me to have insomnia as well Tried just about everything for sleep Works better than some benzos to for sleep I know a lot about benzos Been prescribed Ativan and Valium and this medication puts me to sleep better than those Note this medication works similar to benzos mg will work great to You will sleep fine and wake up feeling great and functioning normal as can be Overall great sleep medicine
8423,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,41347,31,I have trouble sleeping I am also a former drug addict I was prescribed ambien and find that when I take it I make a lot of phone calls the next morning I am always embarassed Last night I made tweleve phone calls including a former coworker years ago I left a voice message on vets answearing service I also discovered to my horror I had sent a number of emails It is like recalling the things you did when you are drunk The uspide I slept stright for about five hours rare for me and was not groggy Indeed I enjoyed about fortyfive mintues to an hour of cheerfulness I remembered the phone calls
8426,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41342,8,I have been a sound sleeper most of my life until I was and began waking up after about hours sleep most nights and was unable to get back to sleep After over a year of this I was always tired and had no stamina I began taking Zolpidem mg every night at bedtime and was able to get to hours sleep almost every night After a month I had normal energy and stamina for my age The only drawback is that I would prefer to hrs sleep which I only attain once or twice a week on the Zolpidem mg I am going to discuss the newer slowrelease version with my doctor for the next refill It has made a significant improvement in my life and activities
8427,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41341,32,Always rolled around in bed since I was a kid trying to stop thinking Sleep just didnt come natural unless I really put my body through the ringer that day Being a kid on those days I sleptDrinking in my mid years helped me get to sleep Then I hit a workanxiety wall in my s Ambien mg put me to sleep With the well known side effects called friends late at night it doesnt work on me fast Ate a lot of crap late I need a good hour more like before I feel the effects probably because I only take now I weigh around pounds The problem with Ambien is you never know when its going to hit you When it does and youre still ambulatory childproof your life
8428,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41337,2,I have been using zolpidemmg over years now Its suppose to be only weeks use but after I stopped using weeks I couldnt fall a sleep all night Since then Im using everyday Im afraid if I stop using it I cant fall a sleep again Im glad Im using only mg Its great for initiating to sleep as it advertises
8429,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41336,14,I have taken this about times now and it works great The only downfall with this pill is that it takes awhile to kick in So I make sure I take it with hours to spare I havent had any hangover from it either
8430,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41324,4,Have been a terrible sleeper my whole life Runs in my family Ambien is a God send for me I take mg and if it doesnt work I take the second half for a total of I do find myself feeling quotdragged downquot some mornings on mg but that wears off and even that at its worst is WAY better than me on no sleep
8431,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,41320,40,Took it for a week Slept fine a couple of nights Felt like a heavy drugged sleep Didnt do anything a couple of nights Stopped taking it after I woke up finding myself standing up at the end of the bed swinging my arms around to get rid of imaginary parrots I heard in the bedroom
8432,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41312,24,Works but had rebound insomnia after about weeks of taking it
8434,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41304,2,Helps me sleep but I tend to talk a lot and buy things online unaware because Im under the influence of the medication
8435,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41303,8,I am in my seventies and have taken zolpidem for about years I split mg pills into thirds I take one at sleep time another when I wake up take another if it is still early in morning when I wake up again Sometimes I take in a night So I take from to each night which works well Using the split pills gives me control on dosage versus CR I am really glad to have it
8436,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,41303,4,Began taking Zolpidem due to insomnia I had no trouble falling asleep but I would not stay asleep and wake up times a night Now I fall asleep and sleep well for an average of hours Usually by am I am awake and not able to fall back to sleep I get up for work at am So at least I am getting good hours but I wish it would last longer I long for hours of sleep I have had no adverse effects Dont wake up groggy and no memory loss
8438,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41297,7,Great feeling before bed and sleep all night
8439,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,41282,57,Caused me to do things and not remember afterwardsI would be cautious while first taking this medication
8440,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41275,57,I was put on mg of Ambien after I was having trouble sleeping during a breakdown I made the mistake one night of taking it and then answering the phone I was on the phone for an hourOh man the cupboard moved all on it ownt hen they were strange people walking up and down the stairs in my house Strange thing is I thought this was funny I fell down twice once breaking a little coffee table Luckily for me my partner was there to help me up the stairs and put me to bed I now only take mg about an hour before bed and it really relaxes me and makes me forget all problems I dont have any trouble sleeping anymore as such just the odd night here and there
8442,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,41254,50,I took my daughter to dinner during which she mentioned our ride to school that morning I asked what she meant She told me I had given her a ride to school that morning I have no recollection of taking her to school leaving the house or coming home It was a surreal experience and after reading the reviews here I have decided to stop taking the medication It does help with sleep but driving in a black out is too scary for me
8443,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41254,3,I am years old and going through some careerrelated stressful period for the last few months as a result of which I have been having bad insomnia which I never had in my life before I am not only having difficulty falling asleep but also sustaining it I started taking zolpidem mg but I cut it in half eventhough its only half a dose for an adult I am also lbs I took about tablets in the last month or so and the results have been largely positive I fall asleep after taking zolpidem half a dose albeit sometimes after hrs after ingestion However I sleep longer and better The only side effect is a mild hangoverlike feeling the day after In sum take it as needed
8444,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41228,6,Ive been taking Ambienzolpidem for about years now I am years old and have had sleep issues as long as I can remember My brain just doesnt turn off at night without it I use the mg dosage but I cut the tip off so that I actually only take about mg nightly With mg I get hours of wonderful sleep but it leaves me with fogbrain for a couple of hours the next day With mg I get hours of sleep and wake up refreshed and clear headed The last few times I had the bright idea to get off the zolpidem I lay awake most of the night wondering why I would want to get off such a great medicine I have had no side effects that I know of
8445,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41227,6,Best sleep ever I have had insomnia for years and this really works every time I will admit that if I stay up for some time on it and it takes effect I want to make and eat popcorn Not the microwaved bag kind but the old fashioned onthestove kind And sometimes I dont remember making the popcorn the next day There is definitely that amnesia effect sometimes I dont remember what I watched on TV after I have taken it or even getting ready for bed shower etc But I still give it a because it does a great job of getting you to sleep and keeping you asleep Also it doesnt make you feel like crap the next day like any other sleep medication especially the over the counter sleep meds Highly recommend for sleep issues
8446,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41219,3,I sleep very well on this but I do not feel rested in the morning
8447,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41218,46,My bipolar disorder triggered severe insomnia and so my doctor gave me Ambien It worked wonders First few nights taking it I saw doubleblurry and then just knocked out got AMAZING rest woke up refreshed Overtime I had some sleep walkingtalkingeating episodes One time I woke up and ate a batch of cookies and another time I made some midnight hot dogs I would wake up feeling unusually bloated haha thats why One time I took the Ambien and decided to take a quick minute hot shower afterwards well my husband told me he caught me talking to the shampoo bottles So weird Listen to the directions take once you are lying in bed unlike me You wont remember a thing Once I swallow the pill I dont remember anything after that
8448,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41217,42,Ive been taking Ambien for almost a month now and I have to say it is amazing The first night I took it it kicked in about minutes later I have never had such a good nights sleep I woke up feeling energized and I had energy all day The only weird thing that I experienced were MILD hallucinations before I actually fell asleep I sat down on the bed and apparently asked my husband quotwhen did we get a water bedquot we dont have a water bed And also I asked him quotwhen did we get pink and green sheetsquot Our sheets are white Other than that nothing scary or frightening I didnt get up in the middle of the night doing anything weird When I did get up to use the restroom I knew I was awake and I knew what I was doing
8449,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41205,1,Works almost all the time for me I have trouble going to sleep most nights dont know why just do Ill be sitting there not thinking about much of anything and next thing I know Ive been laying there for or hours with no sleep This almost always knocks me out and once Im asleep I sleep When it doesnt I take a second
8450,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41195,32,Very happy with Ambien Ive used a half tablet on and off for about two years It really helps me relax and fall asleep Which can be really hard when you are taking six college courses Just make sure you take it right as you fall asleep And do not up your dosage if you feel you are building a quottolerancequot
8451,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41188,35,Had no problems falling asleep only I would wake up to use the bathroom and stay awake for hours Since using Ambien I only take mg I find I can fall back to sleep easily several times a night I wake up feeling very well rested and full of energy
8452,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41181,27,I can fall asleep but never stay asleep and although with Ambien I still woke up times I went right back to sleep no laying there looking at the walls for hours with thoughts
8456,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41160,18,I have been using Ambien for a few years I have never been able to sleep through the night Ambien works well I have had a couple strange experiences however Recently my wife found out she was a serious diabetic so we have really changed our lifestyle you know whole foods fresh and raw fruits and veggies etc I have dropped several pounds just eating well and less The other night I thought I would make a healthy Spam sandwich I used Daves Killer Bread low fat mozzarella and flaxseeds Wife said I was really proud of my creation dont remember a thing
8457,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,41159,25,I have been taking Ambien for about months and it does the job very well I generally take half of my mg pill a few nightsweek I have to take it and go directly to bed or I have zero memory of what happens between taking it and falling asleep The reason that I rate it so low is that Ive started to notice that I have hours of the next day after taking it the night before that I have absolutely no memory of Ive sideswiped the guardrails in my car on the way to work and had no idea that I had done so until my husband asked what happened to the car I had a very faint did I dream that or did it really happen recollection of it I take it fairly early in the evening
8458,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41129,25,This has been very beneficial I have great trouble with falling asleep before am despite getting up early It puts me to sleep its the best Wake up fresh in the morning no residual effects If I stay awake I dont hallucinate or do anything weird as per my husband however if Im lying in bed watching a movie or have a conversation Im unlikely to remember much the next day I dont get depressed or emotional on it either and Im not a zombie
8459,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41123,2,Ambien has been a blessing for me Without it I often didnt sleep more than an hour or two a day for weeks at a time Now at least every other day I get almost a full night of sleep Yes I know it isnt free of side effects but if you can stand them it sure is a relief to be able to get some healing sleep
8462,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,41118,16,Its not working I still stay up or get up to time a night
8463,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,41112,0,The first time I tried Ambien I was told I was sleep walking with nothing on but a tshirt I dont remember this at all but was told I refused to put on my pajama pants or underwear The nd time a couple yrs later I took a generic This time I remembered microwaving a plate in the middle of the night piling a mountain of random foods that should never be seen on same plate I walked out my front door locking myself out Wearing nothing but a tank top and underwear holding that ridiculous plate I thought the door bell wasnt working as I pressed and pressed for a long time My neighbor came out rang it on st try
8465,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41097,31,I have worked rotating shifts for over the years and I have never had enough sleep So I asked my doctor if there was anything I could try He suggested Ambien mg at bedtime So for the last year I now wake up after hours of rest which nothing compared to years of restless nights tossing and turning over to look at a clock Good sleep means a lot and is worth a pill every night
8466,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41093,41,This is the only sleep aid that has ever worked for me I get a good full night sleep I wake up refreshed and not groggy Bless the makers of this medication you have literally changed my life I used to sleep to mins a night now at hours of sleep My blood pressure has come down I no longer battle depression and fatigue and I am productive at work
8468,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41086,35,Works so well but have been taking it for years Wish wish wish I could sleep without it Dont like pills but unable to sleep without it If you cant sleep nothing works like this Ive tried everything herbs melatonin Tryptophane over the counter sleep aids etc Nothing else works Truly an amazing creation
8471,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,41071,38,After using Lunesta for a couple of years the effect began diminishing My doctor prescribed Ambien CR It has worked perfectly for my chronic insomnia I have experienced the memory loss Several times I have sent emails and when I get replies I do not have any memories of what I wrote or of sending the email But I did get very deep sleep so I learned to stay off the computer after taking a pill
8472,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41062,24,I have been taking Ambien since it was released to the public I only use it occasionally Sometimes I have a period of several days where going or staying asleep is a problem then no need for weeks I have never had any after or side effects from taking Ambien I feel it is for me and my condition the best medication on the market
8473,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41039,26,Worked as advertised Really helps
8474,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41031,28,Ambien has been a lifesaver for me I have had insomnia since I was a teen and Ambien has been the only medication I have used that works for meThere are plenty of quotstrangequot things that can happen if you try to do things between the time you take the medication and onset IMPORTANT If you are going to take Ambien be IN BED ready to sleep It takes effect VERY quicklyGreat medication for insomnia
8475,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,41024,9,This medicine has a very strange effect on me Within minutes of taking it I start to feel tired but at the same time develop a massive unyielding erection Its frustrating because the medicine works I am super tired when I take it but too uncomfortable to sleep
8476,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,41017,44,I took this early enough that I still had hours to sleep I woke up feeling refreshed I felt much better than I usually do after sleeping I slept so soundly Other sleeping pills left me feeling groggy the next day but not this
8477,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,41005,1,Zolpidem does work fast However I have a right arm that goes to sleep on me easily So if I take zolpidem I make sure that I fall asleep in a position that will not cut the circulation in my arm
8478,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40983,4,Great product Put me on sleep very fast
8482,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40972,19,Awesome medicine not worried about dependency because insomnia like depression can be chronic When I take one get the best sleep of my life Dont and I cant sleep much like before I started taking it As others have said take it and go DIRECTLY to bed Do not pass go
8488,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40948,12,I was having severe insomnia to the point where I was only getting hours at the most of sleep a night I started to hallucinate after a few days of this and was prescribed Ambien It works fast within minutes after kicking in to fall asleep but I only sleep hours on it and then wake up refreshed I dont get my full hours Not sure whats up with that I tried Ambien CR and it took longer to fall asleep on that and I still only got around hours of sleep on the CR version I still use Ambien and its better than Lunesta which gave me a nasty taste in my mouth and didnt even make me tired Overall I recommend Ambien
8489,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40940,8,I took mg of Ambien for weeks It was effective but when I stopped I hada terrible time trying to sleep Check with your doctor and see if phasing outAmbien with lower doses would be recommended
8493,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,40927,27,I started sleep walking on this medicine My wife found me sitting on the kitchen floor with a bottle of her red wine and Im told that I asked her if we were in San Francisco Or San Jose This stopped my years plus of continued sobriety I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance they thought I might of had a stroke I didnt It was an Ambien blackout I have a very close friend here in San Jose who owns a Recovery home He told me that his place is filling up with people being pulled over driving around town in their Pajamas while thinking they are home in bed Ambien might be great for some people but for folks like me it has evil effects Please be careful people
8494,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40926,16,I have been taking Ambien for about a year now I have two sleep problems I have difficulty falling asleep and when I do manage to fall asleep I usually wake up about hours later and cant get back to sleepI havent noticed Ambien having any effect at all on the first problem Its am as I write this and I havent been to bed yet But it does help with the second When I finally do manage to get to sleep I usually sleep for a good or hoursDifferent people respond to this medication in different ways Be very careful about taking it until you know how it affects you
8495,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40919,20,I am and I had sleep problems from approximately age until age when I started taking Ambien Somewhere in there I almost got fired for falling asleep at work several times so I asked my doctor for help and he prescribed Ambien and I couldnt feel happier about it Most nights I take mg and I sleep well Some nights I have to take mg I have occasional Ambien amnesia but other than that I have had no side affects My doctor keeps telling me I need to quit taking it but since he takes it too he keeps writing me scripts Make sure you dont drink alcohol or take other medicines at the same time and you should be fine My mom and dad had sleep problems so I know it is hereditary I love this medicine
8496,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40919,1,I have been taking this for about years it does work very well If I miss a dose I will have bad nightmares I highly would recommend not driving or doing anything that may cause injury I would say it has a slight intoxicating effect kind of like alcohol You might find yourself doing a lot of things you didnt remember doing when you wake up in the morning
8497,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40919,1,I had back fusion LL the surgery team pulled my left brechiel plexus peripheral nerves leaving my back and left arm in chronic pain pins and needles burning muscle loss and wasting I have used zolpidem on a study basis since until present It works and to use a Dr quoted Remarkable I have very little side effects Thank you for this web site
8498,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40911,1,Ive taken Ambien sporadically since I started using the medication to help me sleep when my husband was deployed What a miracle I have memories of being four years old and struggling to slow my mind down enough to sleep like a normal person I thought that I would always toss and turn and pace the floors of my house for four hours and sleep for two or three for my entire life Im very thankful that my PCM referred me to a psychiatrist to address my sleep issues I still rely on sleep aids many nights and alternate between Ambien and Lunesta Lunesta seems to be much more mild in my experiences whereas Ambien just immediately induces sleep
8499,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40909,14,yrs old could only sleep one hour at a time two or three hours per night Brain dead all day suicidal due to anxiety issues Now sleep or hrs per night I feel almost normal No side effects taking mg at bed time more when I wake up in hrs
8500,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40895,7,Sometimes it helped but other times it didnt I have fibromyalgia though so it could be the pain interfering
8501,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40892,26,This medicine is very effective for shortterm use My experience is mostly good however I do find that it does not work well when I have eaten recently You must take it on an empty stomach I believe the Drug Facts say hour without food before taking it When you take it with food it sometimes does not absorb or takes longer to absorb Also tolerance for me with this medicine goes up quickly so I try to only take it a couple of times a week I have not experienced any addiction symptoms by doing this Side Note A lot of people who take it and report driving significant memory lapses are NOT TAKING IT AS DIRECTED You only take ONE before bedtime and then you GO TO BED DONT take it and go grocery shopping
8502,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40886,15,I love my Ambien but I have been taken it for so many years that I have to skip a few nights a week for it to be effective to me I wonder what would happen if I should not take it ever again and how many sleepless nights and suffering that I would go through without it I juice all the time with healthy greens and carrots and veges I am trying to fight the battle all the time I would like to ween myself off Ambien but am afraid to do so rapidly If I could use it only a few nights a week then I would be fine
8504,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40791,25,Well I have been on Ambien CR mg for close to years now and absolutely love it I think it is the best thing since sliced bread I developed insomnia when I started doing shift work and tried everything under the sun starting with melatonin Benadryl Restoril and all the new ones that have come out since and although some were helpful with helping me fall asleep they did not keep me asleep past the hour markso the Ambient CR has been great for me
8505,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40779,3,I have major insomnia due to other medications I am required to take Doctor has me taking mg of Ambien before bed It is GREAT for helping me to fall asleep but it does not keep me asleep
8506,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40774,9,Edluar has worked better than anything Ive tried It works fast and Im even dreaming again which I wasnt with a few others I actually break mine in half and only take a half dose Still works great Taste is not bad Have had some issues with availability though I hope theyre not taking it off the market
8507,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40765,8,I have read so many things and do not know what to believe I have post traumatic stress disorder and have taken sleep aides from the health food store which left me with Vertigo and not feeling well I have not had any of the usual side effects with Ambien and it leaves me refreshed however I do have one weird side effect and I was not sure at first if it was the Ambien But it is I am usually a person who is cold and likes the heat But I have gotten heat sick several times and living in NYC where there is no air and we are constantly having heat waves it has made me sensitive to heat I am super sensitive and usually if there is a side effect to be had I get it but really I have not had anything except the heat exhaustion I mean sweating etc
8508,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40749,4,Ive been using Ambien for a of couple months now only taking it a few times a week when I think Im going to need a good nights sleep My sleep issue was that Id wake up at around am and not be able to fall back asleep When I take an Ambien I fall asleep about minutes after taking it and dont wake up until my alarm comes on I only use it when I know Ill have trouble sleeping like Monday Mornings and Ive never experienced any weird behaviors like others Ive read about
8509,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40747,5,Im years old and suffer from insomnia and pain from bulging and herniated discs and have undergone three discectomy surgeries I have been taking Ambien for many years and started with the name brand mg while also trying Ambien CR mg then Lunesta and then back to generic Ambien mg This generic version has been working very well for several years allowing me to get a full nights sleep without any side effects and it usually acts quickly
8510,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40742,1,This is a God send I cant shut my mind up when trying to go to bed As long as I go to bed within minutes of taking the pill I only need to take a half of a pill mg maybe every two weeks Ill have to take the half if I stay up too long No groggy wake up to be honest I dont think Ive had any side effects or strange experiences Ive been taking them for about years with the same dosage and Im a beer drinker and it doesnt seem to effect them
8511,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40730,9,Works quickly and I sleep well Fast acting Amazing
8512,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40723,4,Ive been on Ambien for years now and I wouldnt have it any other way Ive been an insomniac all my life and Ambien is a miracle cure My husband and kids absolutely hate it because they say Im a totally different person when Im on it I never have recollection of anything and I dont think its fair that they blame me for something I dont even know Im doing All I know is the sleep is excellent and if youre considering this medicine its good to have someone nearby whos a light sleeper
8513,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40719,0,I dont always stay asleep through the night but enough that Id say it is worth it I have had some odd experiences while taking this medication I experienced sleep eating sleep online shopping sleep talking on the phone Completely bizarre These things can be easily avoided now I am aware it happens I have been taking this for about years and have had no addictive issues with this medication It is the only thing that works outside of the benzodiazepines which are addictive
8515,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40706,9,Ambien has been the only insomnia medicine that has worked consistently for the years I have been taking it I was on a combination of Ambien and Xanax but lost my healthcare coverage so am on Ambien only I totally have to thank the Ambien makers because my life was a messy blur of nonsleep Now I sleep and sleep well
8516,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40703,0,Positive Works quotas advertisedquot in mg or mg tablet form Best used immediately before quothopping into bedquot If used prior to this you maywill experience some amnesia short term memory loss or confusion Things or actions taken MAY be perfectly normal such as convenience store shopping etc I am however extremely grateful that I do not have access to a motor vehicle Impaired judgement should be taken for granted
8519,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40693,8,I have used Ambien for years It worked very well all the time before they introduced the generic brands The generics are NOT the same as the original and do not produce the same results They leave me hung over and each manufacturer has his own brew thus are unpredictable in how they will perform I have offered to pay the difference to get the real Ambien but with no success Sure wish this wasnt so expensive
8520,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,40690,12,Took my first Ambien last night at Started with half like my doctor said Took the other half at am since first half obviously didnt work Here I sit at am and my eyes still havent closed Only difference with me is that when I didnt take I sleep a couple of hours and feel fine Taking Ambien I dont sleep at all but feel tired
8524,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,40673,14,I sleep drove while on Ambien I had packs of cigarettes when I went to bed and packs when I woke up This can be a very dangerous
8525,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40664,2,I took my Ambien thought I went to sleep but instead talked on the phone to my boyfriend who told me I was acting crazy and making no sense I told him I was going to cook and eat all the food in the fridge which I actually did do with no knowledge of it there werent even any leftovers however all the dishes were washed and put away this behavior caused me to gain weight as well as have amnesia for the entire event
8527,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40648,5,Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt but when it does it does
8528,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40646,0,I have used zolpidem for several years without problem However I was very tired and also had a sinus infection that was very severe I took the zolpidem to help me fall asleep and it worked as usual but after an hour or so I got up this was told to me because I have no memory of it I got up went to the bathroom fell I missed the toilet I played in it and painted the floor and walls with it My husband and daughter in law cleaned me up and I resisted but they got it done and I was put back in bed I got up again and fell They put me back to bed and the next morning I could not understand why I was in a different gown
8529,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40873,24,Very consistent seven hours of sleep However If I dont go right to bed I may do things I dont remember like leaving a bunch of lights and the TV on Had to discontinue due to high cost
8530,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40873,8,Good for four hours and then I was wide awake and needed another dose to get back to sleep Good if your only problem is getting to sleep
8531,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40868,11,This works great for me sleepwise but when I take full mg Im incredibly saddepressed the entire next day mg doesnt take me throughout the whole night Any other suggestions
8532,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40865,11,I suffer from OCD Sleep is a luxury Ambein is the first medicine Ive taken that has offered any relief I still dont sleep the entire night but hrs is a Dod send I dont understand why cant be prescribed I could take the second one upon waking and actually get hrs sleep I suffer no side effects from it
8534,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40854,12,I started Ambien when Lunesta did not work for me and it was effective in helping me sleep One problem developed I began getting up in the middle of the night and eating especially if I thought of something before I dozed off eg the chocolate cake I was saving til tomorrow etc I had to stop when I woke up with a cut on my hand and realized I had cut up a leftover pork chop to eat I had no recollection of eating slicing my hand or putting the bandage on I cut down to half dose mg and the night eating stopped I wish I could find a substitute but this really helps me sleep deeply and feel refreshed when I get up in the morning
8535,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40846,11,I tried Ambien about a year ago for my inability to stay asleep I have several times a year where I wake up between and every morning for a few months at a time For me Ambien worked I slept soundly through the night until my alarm woke me up and I really enjoyed it I was unaware of my certain side effect until my wife insisted we had a conversation I had no memory of So I started asking around to people I worked with and sure enough I had quite a few instances where I had full conversations with people the mornings after I used Ambien and had no memory of it It got to the point where I had to speak to my bosses and ask them if I had any assignments I was not up to date on Luckily I was not
8536,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40841,1,The pill keeps changing its size color and shape everytime I go to the pharmacy Sometimes I find that I have to take almost to get me to fall asleep Also I grind my jaw a little bit after I take it It was never like this before so I am wondering why it is doing this now
8537,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40838,17,Ive been using Ambien mg for about months and it works great I suggest going straight to bed after taking it Also give yourself hours of time to sleep Ambien knocks me out in minutes and I sleep about hours Feel great when I wake up I cant turn my mind off when I go to bed so it has been a big help Im and this is the st medicine Ive taken on a regular basis so I was nervous about taking Ambien at first It has been great
8539,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,40830,0,I suffer from insomnia pretty bad I can fall asleep easily but by or Im wide awake I worked in a bakery for years and recently had to quit I couldnt function like a normal person anymore I saw several doctors and psychiatrists all who at one point or another prescribed me Ambien I had some pretty weird episodes on this medicine I would get up and rearrange cabinets naked in the middle of the night My husband got very upset with me I found a great doctor who finally diagnosed me with bipolar II with a little OCD and depression My medicines are where I like them and he prescribed me Lunesta This is a much better sleep aid and I am finally sleeping a full night
8540,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40829,1,My insurance wont cover the brand name so Im taking the generic I have had awful insomnia lately and I tried other medications that had really weird side effects so I had to stop taking them With the generic zolpidem I found that it works only if Im not over tired I could sleep hours straight but I am still tired maybe because of personal problems When it works its great but when it doesnt then I am up most of the night
8543,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40819,34,I have taken Ambien CR mg for about years off and on This product works great for my insomnia but as other users have stated I have experienced episodes of sleep walking making random phone calls texting cooking and having wild sex with my husband without any memory of it all My suggestion is that you take the pill and go straight to bed to lessen the chances of sleep walking However you still run the risk of doing strange things anyway Other than the sleepwalking Ambien has given me the best sleep hours of sleep of my life
8545,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40813,4,Ive taken Ambien for insomnia off an on over several years I love it Works great mostly Sometimes I have the side effects not remembering what I had done while on it My husband says I always look at my phone and freak out or freak out about my skin I tell him it looks so strange I never remember it of course I still use it I wake up rested
8546,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40811,8,I dont have the typical insomnia I can fall asleep very easily so easily Ive almost considered myself to be slightly narcoleptic But I cant stay asleep and I dont fall into that deep sleep that youre supposed to I wake up several times a night and even though I can fall right back to sleep if youre not getting quotrestful sleepquot then youre going to be tired Ambien knocks me out I take mg I am a lb female so I need the mg to sleep for to hours Sometimes if I am just exhausted I can break it in half and sleep fine But mg is perfect for me But I am codependent on it now I dont mind it so much Its nice to know I will be rested after going to bed at pm and waking up at am
8547,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40804,5,Gets you to sleep every time Dont wake up throughout the night No sleeping pill hangover effect Never experienced any bad side effects
8548,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40802,1,Started zolpidem for insomnia due to anxiety from a cancer diagnosis Prior to this time I had no sleep problems I started with mg two nights in a row but it had NO effect The next night I tried one and a half pills mg which worked GREAT but I could barely get out of bed after hours of sleep I figured out that I could take mg about an hour before bedtime and a half pill at bedtime and get hours of great sleep and no problems getting out of bed in the morning HOWEVER after about week I discovered NOTABLE memory loss particularly with occasionally searching for words I once came home from work and saw a note I had apparently written to my wife that morning but didnt remember writing Decided to switch medicines
8549,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40797,1,Ive been on Ambien for years no problems Im months out from having gastric bypass surgery Two months ago I started waking up in the night restless agitated heart pounding feeling like I couldnt get a deep breath of air so I could relax racing thoughts horrible Then started doing strange things in sleep eating no recollections of having done certain things Quit taking Ambien per docs recommendation but now I can only sleep hours a night Have tried herbal supplements with no luck Think Im going to try Ambien again Maybe mg at bedtime and another mg when I wake up accompanied with a Xanax Hope it works
8550,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40796,6,I havent had a good night sleep in years I was in the hospital for spine surgery when they gave AMbien to me to help me sleep I have tried about every sleeping pill over the counter prescribed but did nothing but Ambien worked great The only side effect I have had is walking in my sleep Havent had anything happen other than waking up on the couch but feel better and a lot more energy It is great
8551,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,40793,9,It worked great for the first few weeks I didnt take it every night just the nights where I was having a hard time falling asleep The problems stared one night when I was seeing people in my closet and my furniture seemed to be falling on top of my bed I tired taking it again and I fell right asleep A week later I began seeing Gummy Bears jumping around my room and on my bed I went back to my doctor and told her I was seeing things and she said it was common I stayed on the Ambien until one night my boyfriend told me that I was sitting up in bed with my eyes open acting as if I was at work Typing in the air and I began scratching his skin very hard I woke up in the morning NOT remembering a single thing Havent taken it since then
8553,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40792,17,I have been taking Ambien for about or years I have been an insomniac since I was a teen At first I would take my mg and fall asleep in about minutes I would sleep through most of night but when it was time for alarm to go off to wake up kids and take them to school I would still wake up before the alarm went off wide awake no groggy feeling at all After taking it for a year it would take hours to kick in which I would not remember anything Then yrs ago our yr old daughter died in an accident and Ambien became a God send I have been able to sleep the last yrs away and Ambien has graciously taken my memories during that time so I can make it day by day I can honestly say without Ambien I would not still be here
8554,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40646,7,After my doctor prescribed Edluar MG due to my complaint of only getting hours sleep because of the pain I have been experiencing I now get a full hours sleep I awaken feeling refresh I do not feel tired I feel a lot better than before I was having a very difficult time sleeping past hours since November
8555,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40643,0,I have been taking Zolpidem for night terror for years and has made my life so much better then you could ever think I believe that I have never had a side effect to my recollection I tried Lunesta and it really missed my up emotions My only bad thoughts about zolpidem would be long term use is life time use
8556,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40638,7,Ive been taking Ambien since January and about weeks ago I began to have issues sleeping only been getting hrs a night I called my psychologist and family doctor about the situation I was given Lunesta through my family doctor Tried that for a couple days and couldnt still couldnt sleep Then I thought it was my Wellbutrin so I went quotcold turkeyquot on that for about a week until I almost had a break down Then I started taking half of my Wellbutrin and feel a little better My psychologist just gave me a prescription for the Ambien Cr and only have taken for nights so far I just want some sleep my grades are suffering and so is my job
8561,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40615,21,Ambein CR is great I took it for years until AARP Medicare prescription drug plan removed it from their list I did not experience any known side effects It is the only medicine for insomnia that has worked for me Maybe soon the insurance company will realize that and stop causing me to lose sleep
8564,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40592,33,So far I really like Zolpidem ER generic form I was having a lot of trouble falling asleep because my mind was always racing My doctor prescribed mg at first and this did not really seem to help He then suggested that I take two to equal mg and this did the trick I try to make sure Im done with dinner and any snacking by PM and I take this at PM right as Iquotm getting into bed This softly puts me to sleep within minutes Ive read it should not disturb quotsleep architecturequot I gave an because I still wake up about am but I can fall back asleep
8567,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40575,10,When you take Ambien make SURE you are in bed Also do not drink when you are taking this medicine
8568,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40567,9,I had been contemplating taking a sleep aide for some time now but after my engagement fell apart I really need it more than ever I have been on Ambien for weeks now and although I think it helps I took mine hours ago and Im still here Once I do fall asleep it is a very sound and restful sleep but I still lay in bed tossing and turning thinking of what could have and should have been
8569,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40556,1,I am concerned by what I read about many of the side effects but before I took Ambien I never slept well I have been taking Ambien for about a year and sleeping better not great I stopped for two weeks and didnt sleep well at all
8571,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40546,5,Periodically I take Ambien I have tried other sleep aids Lunesta Seroquel and others However Ambiem is the one sleep prescription that allows me a good nights sleep and wake up without a drugged feeling I am then ready to take on the world Ambien is great and I would definitely recommend it
8573,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40535,3,Worked for sleep but I ran out one time and realized I got very very depressed on it Plus had joint and jaw pain all the time Took years to figure out what caused it
8576,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40530,12,Edluar is a much better option to Ambien because its fast acting and thus helps to prevent many of the embarrassing Ambien issues such as Ambieneating Ambienemailing etc It may help to prevent abuse because it acts so quickly The taste is not bad and quickly dissolves Most people should not have issues with the flavor unless they are sensitive to taste I would not recommend this for longterm use but it would be a solution for people who have insomnia issues and MUST fall asleep quickly because they have something important to do the next day
8577,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40530,5,I was prescribed this after suffering from insomnia for several years Tried OTC sleeping pills which made me feel hyper all night and just a sick overall feeling Ambien is not for longterm use as I have learned Ambien was fantastic the first year I took it I would look forward to taking it feeling peaceful and going to bed In the past year I take it feel sick and hungovery and decide to go lay down I do fall asleep but wake up in the morning feeling sick and with a headache I have to drag myself out of bed I know it is from taking Ambien for too long so I am switching to something else Was helpful for about a year
8578,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40529,8,I have taken Ambien for a few years due to night shift work I went to a swing shift and now am not working But after years of night shift I cant get to sleep before or am I just lay there I started taking mg at bedtime and immediately noticed I was telling my boyfriend things I did not remember I once got up and put a dozen eggs on to boil and went back to bed I have a old stove that works sometimes Thank GOD it did not work The eggs did not get cooked and no fire I have been so depressed after I wake up the next day I just have to stop the Ambien and deal with the sleep problem My boyfriend has slept on the couch a couple of times because I am trashing around and talking to him
8579,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40524,3,Ive been taking Ambien occasionally for the past weeks following a knee replacement surgery The Doctor said it is very common to have sleep issues after a knee replacement and sent me home with a script I have to say I use it times a week with no problems I wake up refreshed and so far no weird side effects
8580,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40519,16,I have only been taking Ambien for months or so I too have insomnia I can get to sleep but wake up and cant get back to sleep My experience with Ambien has been crazy I have had a phone conversation and made plans to go to lunch with a friend and when she called the next day to see if we were still on I had no memory of our conversation I have cooked scrambled eggcheese breakfast at pm and put it away for breakfast the next day Last night however was the scariest I vaguely remember sweeping up hair so I looked in the garbage this morning and was relieved to not find any hair I passed it off as a dream Then I took a good look in the mirror my bangs on the left side are now only quot long How embarrassing
8581,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40517,5,Ambien CR was prescribed to me for long term use after I was only able to get a hours of sleep per night due to insomnia It did help me get to sleep took effect within minutes on an empty stomach and stay asleep However it also makes things seem D that arent like text on a computer screen and gives an overall quottrippyquot feeling Ambien CR also has a rather strong hangover effect that can last awhile up to hours from the time it was taken
8582,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40515,11,Was on Ambien for almost years because of insomnia due to overnight shift fibromyalgia and depression that got really bad the last months Started with mg days a week and it worked really fast I would have to be in bed in minutes after I took it otherwise I would start having weird hallucinations but that was a sign for me to jump in bed and I would sleep fine But had to go up as I build up tolerance and the last couple of months had to take mg pills and would wake up hours later and needed to take another one to get more sleep again I would only get hours Obviously it stopped working so tonight I go the first time in about a year without it and so far I havent been able to sleep in yet been up for hours
8583,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,40514,11,Improved my ability to get to sleep but I stopped taking it because of strange side effects at nightnightmares talking in my sleep slugging the headboard of the bed fallingdiving out of bed during a fight dream having conversations with my wife that I would have no memory of the next day Doctor decided to take me off Ambien today and try something else
8584,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40511,2,At first I could take one mg and be knocked out in mins but after being used to it I took mg one night and all I got was nausea So it was GREAT at first better than anything else but now it has lost all effect
8585,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,40502,10,I rated it a overall for ME Ita a and worked great for falling asleep but I had the sleep walk issues too I read many comments about the sleep walking cooking etc I also did this along with other crazy things Im fortunate I didnt hurt myself or someone else I live alone and my point is DO NOT take this without someone else in your home
8586,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40499,9,I have been taking first Ambien and then Ambien CR for many years I have had major difficulty in falling asleep and staying asleep Although both medications work I cannot function typically the day after Furthermore both need to be taken right before bedtime and no sooner Amnesia and sleepwalking were major issues to the point where my doctor told me to stop taking bothMy physician offered Silenor as an alternative He told me I could take this everyday and although I didnt really need to no addiction potential for Silenor Also none of those nasty side effects like amnesia and sleepwalking I can remember going to sleep staying asleep and waking up without feeling sluggish Silenor has been good to me
8588,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,40480,9,I took Ambien for years and it helped me sleep at first Then instead of sleeping I would walk around without any memory of it I gained weight from eating without any memory I think Ambien could be great for occasional insomnia but I dont recommend it for long term use
8589,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40478,13,Ambien works great when taken as directed IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR LONG TERM EVERY DAY USE I have used refills which have lasted me a year although I was authorized refills in that time I am very upfront with my doctor and tell him that occasionally due to working Midnight to my sleep gets thrown off so I take ONE WHEN NEEDED If your sleep disorder is to the point that you feel you need it everyday you and your doctor should probably look at an alternative Yes your body can and will become dependent on it if for nothing else to sleep It can be an awesome medication when used properly occasionally and conservatively
8590,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40475,17,After the birth of my child I had a difficult time sleeping The tireder I got the less I could sleep My OB gave me Ambien to help me get sleep At first I was concerned but I hadnt slept in days so my husband promised to listen for the baby I have to say without this medicine I would never have made it through my insomnia I would advise that if you take this drug you let a loved one know so they can look out for you I have tried to do a few stupid things while on this drug like put stupid things on facebook and emailing people stupid things Each time my husband stopped meYOU CANNOT USE THIS MEDICINE WITHOUT A WING MAN
8593,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,40472,10,Ambien does not do a thing for me I started taking mg before bed and worked up to taking it or hours before bed without any change I even tried taking mg in the afternoon and mg in the evening and still no help with sleep
8594,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,40471,7,I have been taking Ambien for years now for insomnia and trouble sleeping It does make you tired but you also feel really good and happy I would take it and an hour later not remember anything Also I would still wake up every hour It helped me fall asleep but not stay asleep Recently I over dosed on Ambien That is what really woke me up This is not for me I have been prescribed Seroquel for my sleeping problems and this is wonderful I have no more sleepwalking and I remember everything
8595,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40469,17,I am a young woman who never had issues falling asleep but as I was planning my wedding and the stress of work I was having a hard time I was really nervous to take Ambien at first because of the negative reviews but my experience has only been positive I fall asleep within a few minutes and stay asleep but I dont find myself in too much of deep sleep that I couldnt wake up in case of an emergency It really changed my mindset on medication and sleeping aids in general I would recommend it to anyone
8596,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40465,8,I started taking Ambien for insomnia about a month ago It works great if I am able to take it early enough to get in hours of sleephoweverI also take Wellbutrin and apparently they do not work well together I have been sleep eating sundaes brownies yogurt sandwiches I also cook and leave the mess behind and dont remember ANY OF IT I colored my hair with two colors and gave myself the worst haircut Ive ever had in my life and was totally shocked the next morning when I saw the bright pink color in my hair and awful short bangs and uneven length I had a conversation with my daughter and gave her permission to spend the night out which I would NOT have done in my right mind and she made me write it down for proof
8597,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40463,7,Ambien is absolutely great a miracle Calms the mind I suffer from severe anxiety sometimes panic attacks Ill take them during the day and the panic and anxiety just melts away Fantastic for many psychological disorders but best for sleeping Take on an empty stomach or you wont get the full effect
8598,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40462,13,When I was in the service I had a few bouts with sleep problems only times in years I was put on Ambien for weeks at a time Eventually it would wear off Id go back to quotdealing with itquot Then for a few years I self medicated with whiskey No big dramatic story but that had to stop When I got out I didnt even try to claim compensation for it with the VA but they gave me a insomnia comp Since then I receive my pills in the mail I have never had a negative side effect No sleep walking talking driving It works better on an empty stomach though Ive woken up at night on it before but I normally fall right back to sleep I wake up feeling like I got that perfect amount of sleep and so refreshed It has given me my life back
8599,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40461,5,I took two Ambien and according to my family came down stairs greeted them all like I never seen them before Then went into the kitchen and performed a kitchen show talking to myself and my new recipes Then went back to bed I have no memory of this
8601,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,40421,7,Ambien worked great at helping me fall asleep but was terrible with helping me stay asleep which found out after weeks of taking it it is a sleep inducer I had no other side effects other than I would only get hours of sleep a night
8602,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40410,19,I took my first Ambien last night I laid in bed for almost an hour before I took it then after taking the Ambien I would say I fell asleep within minutes I did wake up twice during the night but went right back to sleep and woke up at this morning with a clear head and refreshed At this point I think Ambien rocks I have always had trouble shutting down my mind and falling asleep I have tried numerous prescriptions and over the counter medications with unsatisfactory results
8604,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40404,19,This medicine combined with mg of Remeron the sedating antidepressant has improved my quality of life tenfold Ambien zolpidem works very quickly and puts me to sleep within minutes Remeron works more slowly and keeps me in a deep restful sleep Ive tried both medicines in isolation with limited success Taking only zolpidem gives me a short sleep of about hours On its own Remeron will put me to sleep for hours but takes two hours to start working The combination of the two is perfectly synergistic Its the quotsilver bulletquot to my insomnia and lowgrade depression which Ive had all of my years Ive never been happier or healthier
8605,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40404,2,Ambien does the trick However you build a tolerance fairly quickly I also had many many weird experiences the years I was on it I stopped taking however and now take Trazodone but will likely switch back in a year or so
8606,Zolpidem,Not Listed / Othe,10,40387,1,I have been on this generic Ambien for about two years I cant sleep without it I try to not take it but I wont get any sleep with out this It takes me about minutes to fall asleep after I take it It works great for me No side effects
8607,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40385,0,No side effects No grogginess Feel good when I wake up Sleep soundly for hours Takes about minutes to take effect
8608,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40384,9,Really effective and helped me sleep but also found myself confused and sometimes sleepwalking in one case I was pretty badly injured jumping back into bed but it was the home office desk I dove into not the bed It was a strange experience because I never walked in my sleep and thought I could clearly see and knew where I was it equaled quotbedroomquot at am Take with caution
8609,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40383,14,Ive been an Ambien user now for years And like a lot of other post Ive read I find it is much more effective when taken on an empty stomach I too have had my crazy nightly side effectsPainting my toe nails dying my hair a box of cereal completely eaten and an almost dead cell phone to where I had been on the phone half the night saying god knows what and yes all this in one night I agree that if you take it correctly and on an empty stomach you should lay down within the first minutes if not you never know where you may end up It gives you almost an errie jolt of energy that you remember nothing about
8610,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40375,15,Ive been using mg Ambien for about years now I sleep very soundly and awake hours later refreshed and loads of energy Not every night maybe or times a week It is my miracle drug but ONLY if I take it on an empty stomach I too have had some quotamnesiaquot like times When I first began taking it I called an ex boyfriend while my husband was asleep next to me Thank God the side effects have gone away
8611,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40368,27,I too have had embarrassing experiences on Ambien While it helps me sleep I often make phone calls or send nasty evil emails or texts in the middle of the night or am when I was sure I was asleep I woke up one morning with my hand bandaged Startled I unwrapped my hand and noticed I had chopped off the end of my finger Luckily I had the wits about me I guess to nurse my wound I walked into the kitchen and realize I was cooking a ten course meal in the middle of the night One time I woke up at in the morning to find myself flat on my back on the concrete deck behind my neighbors house I did have my underwear on but it was October in Minnesota and it was a degree night I felt great though Dont taunt Ambien
8612,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40341,14,I am a pharmacy tech and am on Ambien CR mg I have been on it for about months now but I dont take it every night When I do take it as my thyroid is hyperactive I do feel rested in the morning but when I dont take it its really not a big deal It does help with my sleep but I do hide my car keys from myself just in case
8614,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40325,7,Ive been taking Ambien for and years I think it works great especially when traveling Sometimes just mg does it and I have even used just sometimes It just relaxes the mind to let you sleep The only time I did something silly was when I had a few drinks and took one Thats not good
8615,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,40318,11,Too many side effects for a drug that didnt help me sleep
8616,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40300,4,I have taken Zolpidem mg nightly every night for at least the past years It works for me No side effects for me I worry a little about the long term effects of daily use but unless bad long term effects start turning up in the medical publications I plan to continue daily use of this medication
8617,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40300,52,I love this medicine I have delayed sleepphase disorder and Ive been using Ambien for the last five years I learned pretty quick that I have to take it and go lie down the first time I took some I thought quotWell Ill go have a quick bath before I go to bedquot My husband says I wandered in an hour later talking about how the bathtub faucet changed into a ravens head and we the faucet and I that is had a very long and profound conversation about the Harry Potter novels and the social implications thereof
8618,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40297,24,I started taking Ambien about a year ago I had a terrible car accident a year before then and thats when my sleeping problems began I must say it works very well and for some of the side effect I have heard and read about I have had a couple myself My children brought a cake home from church and the next morning it was gone I was upset they promised me mom you ate the whole thing you wouldnt even share I decided to read up on the side effects and sure enough that was one of them But really nothing else but treating myself to some cake I guess I thought I deserved It really has been a true blessing to sleep well I can take care of my little girls with the energy I need I truly think Ambien works wonders
8619,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40296,23,Insomnia cleared by use of Ambien Have been using nightly for about years No side effects whatsoever However my dosage is small
8620,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40295,26,When it works it works well with no next day grogginess I am a long time user beginning in I have pretty much stopped after using it every night for years I have tried Lunesta and I sleep two hours even with double dose Rozerem had no effect I may be trying Seroquel next I had nighttime events with no memory of them I typically had one event every few months but some were potentially deadly Yes I too cooked all the time with no memory of it I would wake up and crack eggs in the sink and food on the table I also VERY IMPORTANT would go on line send e mail that was highly damaging andor embarrassing and have no memory of doing it until I got responses ALSO NIGHT DRIVING WITH NO MEMORY of the event
8621,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40289,4,Perfect for getting a full nights sleep when in chronic pain
8623,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40280,7,I may sound like a commercial here but I want to share that my experience with generic zolpidem versus name brand Ambien is night and day The generic barely works I needed two generic tablets to get the same sleep effect as one name brand tablet and the generic leaves me with a headache the next day and causes depression I tried it for several months because name brand through my insurance is much more expensive generic name brand and I have to say the name brand is far superior For my experience the generic zolpidem was awful I would rate it a on a scale of to and the name brand is a
8625,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,40276,16,After having an accident at work a few years ago I wasnt falling asleep until the sun came up because of chronic pain My muscle relaxers and pain medicines were no longer giving me enough relief to sleep at night so my doctor put me on Ambien CR After about weeks I had to stop taking it because I was hallucinating I was suffering from severe anxiety I had tremors I dont have enough room here to list everything I am now on Restoril and I dont have any side effects at all
8626,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40275,5,This is my second night of taking Ambien CR Mg Last night I fell asleep and woke up with the pictures hanging on the wall on top of me Im not sure what happened there but hopefully everything will be better I have my fingers crossed
8629,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,40218,89,Although Ambien did the job to rid me of insomnia the side effects were too frightening so I had to stop using it I began sleep walking sleep cookingyes an entire meal at AM and I dont remember and finally sleep driving I was stopped by a state trouper in my pajamas on I heading west at PM Dont remember any of it Never took it again
8631,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40214,4,Ambiem is God send years ago I couldnt sleep for weeks at a time Started mg AmbiemStarted sleepwalking sleep eating walking dancing but I didnt clean up after my escapade Reduced dose to mg much better go to sleep and stay in bed for six hours
8632,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40206,23,Ive tried this medicine and it is quite goodI dont have to suffer from insomnia anymore Thanks to ambien
8633,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40205,26,Before I started taking Ambien I would fall asleep for an hour wake up and maybe not go back to sleep at all If I did fall asleep it would only be for a short time I sleep solidly from pm to am and am no longer tired and run down during the day That is worth everything
8634,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40199,33,After using Ambien for about a week I was desperate for sleep I started to experience short term memory loss I traveled to attend a workshop and could not recall or review much of the information just hours after
8635,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,40197,26,My mother is and has had a problem with Ambien for the four or so years she has started taking it She ran over a bunch of signs in the middle of the highway with no memory of it She got lost twice before we realized it was the Ambien and not Dementia I keep it away from her and administer it each night She is like a drug addict as she has reported her pills lost and got duplicate prescriptions sent to her I think it is too strong for older people
8637,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40186,24,I was just recently prescribed Ambien for insomnia and pain medicines for the almost fatal gunshot wound that almost took my life almost years ago I used to be a law enforcement officer and now I cant work anymore because of the injury I just bought a brand new Charger with a hemi and I took a Ambien before I took a shower and my family told me that I tried to get in my car and take off So please be careful when you take them
8638,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,40186,26,I was taking Lunesta which is fantastic however Blue Shield would not cover this drug until I first tried regular Ambien and then Ambien CR in that order Regular Ambien only put me asleep for about hours Ambien CR would work for a full night However both versions of Ambien gave me a dull headache as they were taking effect The next days following Id be in a really foul mood depressed anxious and a real quotfight pickerquot with others No such problems with Lunesta Luckily my employer switched to Blue Cross which does not pay for Ambien CR but does pay for Lunesta so Im in luck I wish these insurance companies would just let doctors prescribe whatever works
8639,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40185,3,I have been taking this medication every night for about months I love it This has been salvation This has Helped me with SEVERE insomniaI would recommend this medicine to anyone
8640,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40184,29,I was diagnosed with insomnia five years ago after a string of very traumatic life events Even as a small child I typically tossed and turned for up to three hours before falling asleep Despite these facts I believed I was just not meant to sleep normally My therapist suggested a sleep study and I was quickly referred to a psychiatrist who reviewed my past history as well as my current situation and prescribed mg of Ambien I am finally able to sleep normally I wake up with energy and actually enjoy early mornings with my daughter because Im well rested I dont take this medication on a nightly basis because I do enjoy the occasional glass of wine and I have no desire to experience unpleasant side effects
8641,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40182,8,I love Ambien although its effectiveness dwindles I like to split my mg tablets into five and combine it with bar of Xanax sleep like a dream and I am not groggy at allRestoril is fabulous too
8642,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40173,39,Helps me sleep through the night for the first time in my life The first time I ever took it I made the mistake of not going to bed right away so I did have some hallucinations They werent scary but I make sure to take it only when I go to bed There are some definite sexual side effects much to my husbands good fortune It all seems like a vague dream when I wake up Its probably a good idea to only take it when youre living with someone you trust
8643,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,40165,18,I have had insomnia since I was a small child I have PTSD and severe anxiety this is the only medication I have tried that truly makes me get plus hours of sleep and I wake up feeling wonderful

8647,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40150,30,I was prescribed Ambien for insomnia because I am going through a particularly stressful time in my life It does put me to sleep quickly but Ive had several bouts of sleep walking The last one was two nights ago and this one might actually cause me to stop taking it My room mate said I got up and started to cut up some chicken then mixed it with some dry dog food This wouldnt be bad if I then fed it to my dog but instead I started feeding it to myself Thankfully after I took one bite she said I spit it out so I guess I wasnt completely out of it I discovered other things like food taken out of the fridge and sugar spilled on the counter Other than these things the drug works great
8648,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,40149,23,I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue Ambien worked like a charm for two months Then it completely stopped being effective
8649,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,40148,17,I tried this medicine but had to discontinue using it The side effects were horrible for me

8654,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40133,28,After years of getting up every hour and a to urinate I am now able to sleep for hours without waking This has changed my Life
8658,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40116,17,This has been very helpful for me My sleeping pattern has been messed up for years since having a daughter with a significant disability which included among many other things a sleeping disorder Ambien has enabled me to fall asleep consistently after a short period of time trying to fall asleep whereas I used to more often than not lay awake for hours before falling asleep It is interesting for me that there has been a couple of times where I was not able to go to bed for over an hour after taking it and it didnt seem to make me feel any more groggy or sleepy but when I did finally go to bed I fell right asleep
8659,Zolpidem,Insomnia,4,40114,3,I have not been happy with this medication It causes extreme drowsiness indigestion amp wakes me up within a few hours I also find myself eating in the middle of the night Since I tend toward depression it makes me feel even more so
8660,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40113,11,Ive taken mg Ambien CR on an off for months now Within the last two weeks its been more like every day I was so groggy all day Also Im not sure I slept It was more like just being turned off rather than in a state of recuperative sleep I cut the pill in half last night and had only hours of sleep where I awakened twice I still feel more refreshed than ever probably because this is the first time in weeks I dont have an ambien hangover Its a great medicine but Id like to ween myself off of it I suspect its either causing depression or is amplifying a depression I didnt know I had
8661,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40107,10,First time I went on Ambien CR I was disoriented and felt like I was having an outofbody experience I was on it for days I decided after trying several other medicines that I would try it again Now I get hrs asleep and I feel better now that I am getting to sleep Still am a little tired throughout the day but I dont feel insane from lack of sleep Definetly hooked on it because when I miss I know

8663,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40106,77,My husband loves that I take Ambien Hes never been happierThe amnesia that accompanies Ambien really works in his favor if I wake up in the morning and hes smiling I know I have forgotten something something really important But for me its the best night sleep ever I do have Ambien amnesia so I have to be carefulThe Ambien CR has a two hour hole in the middle of the night for me For two solid hours Im wide awake Zolpidiem is the generic form and I have found I have to take a higher dose than the name brand Insurance demands genericI have been taking it for yrs
8664,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,40102,13,It does work very well Its quite similar to Ambien but the taste bitter and makes it very difficult to let it dissolve under your tongue for a few minutes without vomiting Aside from that though it takes only minutes from the time it finishing dissolving before it kicks in Pop the pill in your mouth and or minutes later you wont be able to keep your eyes open Its pretty impressive actually
8666,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,40100,1,I have been taking the generic zolpidem for years without a problem I love my Ambien wake up without being drowsy Have noticed a longer time frame before it kicks in the longer I take it If very anxious can wake me after hours Overall a great medicine and I am very sensitive with medications

8673,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,40091,5,For me it was not quite as good as Restoril and Dalmane but it is right up there
8674,Zolpidem,Insomnia,6,40090,35,I have a friend who had taken ambien for years without any problems For whatever reason he had an episode where he took his pill and then remembers nothing until he was at the police station He had drank three beers which he only knows because thats all that was in his frig then proceded to drive and ended up crashing into another parked car This is scarey stuff eh It works wonderfully but I surely wouldnt want to have a blackout and end up driving Is there any class action suit against this drug Ive heard of the other stories walking naked in the winter cold eating while sleeping and then my friends experience

8677,Zolpidem,Insomnia,3,40076,37,Ambien worked well for the sleep issues but if you are having any issues or stress in your life you may want to try and find something else It makes you very agitated at anyone you may come in contact with and may cause depression

8788,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,39963,26,I have taken Ambien for about years with no side effects
8789,Zolpidem,Insomnia,7,39962,3,Very interesting drug I was prescribed Zolpidem by my psychiatrist but found that it did not work later determined because of other psychological problems however I still took it every night I found that I started doing things I would never do normally I went for walks at am fully cognitive came home put my shoes away hung up my clothes and watched TV for a few hours I felt perfectly normal but my wife started questioning me about what I was saying to her never violent She said that my conversations always made sense but they were so out of the blue Sometimes I remembered them sometimes I didnt If this drug does not work immediately dont take it
8790,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,39952,31,This drug does work great for sleep I have used it for several years actually and it never fails to put me to sleep PLEASE BE WARNED I did take some and had an accidentno one was hurt thank Goodness but I did receive a DUI for it even though I was just and yes I mean percent not mg above the legal threshold for intoxication no excuse just saying courts dont go easy on you I was not taking more than prescribed but I had it in my system when I rear ended someone This was after taking it for years so I was very tolerant of it and I remember everything from it it was a just a minor accident Do not drive if you think there is any in your system I am not saying be afraid of it it really really works Just be careful
8791,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,39950,10,Great drug Never knew how important sleep was to the human body Would only sleep hours a night and thought that was normal However since I have been on Ambien I eat at night and do not remember it at all My family tells me I am funny but do not remember talking to them Never had dreams before now they are vivid and real and colorful this is a bit on the weird side
8792,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,39942,172,Had sleep problems since College years old now Took all the normal heavy duty sleep medicines like Valium and even Benadryl These only put me in a half sleep state and made me feel horrible for days on in After years of suffering from insomnia and after a bout with meningitis in my friend a neurologist who was seeing me for post meningitis asked me how I was sleeping I told her I havent had a good nights sleep in over years She wrote a script for Ambien I have never been so in love with a pill in my life as I am with Ambien I fall asleep within minutes get a good hours hard sleep and wake up bright and early and feel rested like I have not felt in decades Ambien is a miracle drug and thanks to the genius who made it
8796,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,39934,16,I have been using Ambien CR for years I love it I make sure to take it on an empty stomach and in minutes I am asleep The only things I would warn about is make sure you have at least hours of sleep time it doesnt work well if you eat before taking the pill and I have done some things I have no memory of doing My husband has tried Ambien CR and said it doesnt work on him I would recommend Ambien CR to anyone who has trouble falling and staying asleep
8800,Zolpidem,Insomnia,5,39918,19,Im a college student with sleep onset insomnia Before Ambien I was taking overthecounter sleep pills a night with unhappy results The fact is Ambien works Ive been on it for a few months now and I can tell that I need it EVERY night and I am beginning to need more so I take the occasional nd pill I wish there was another way If there is a situation in which you need a short time sleep medicine this is it But this is not something to live your life dependent on which is the case with most cases of insomnia
8801,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,39913,11,Zolpidem worked well at the mg dose for about or nights Then I noticed my lips were dry mildly cracked and tender Gradually I noticed that the tip of my tongue felt as though it had been burnt I ignored that as I drink hot coffee On the th day I used a Listerinelike mouthwash the result was an immediate and severe reaction the inside of my mouth became bright red and swollen My face broke out in scattered red spots or streaks Once I had spat out the mouthwash and the pain had gone down I noticed that my eyes or the tissue around my eyes also felt dry and sore Two days later the reaction is gradually clearing
8802,Zolpidem,Insomnia,10,39910,17,The thing I love most about Ambien is that I can still wake up and function if I need to and then fall back to sleep I have three kids and if one of them wants a glass of water in the middle of the night or falls out of bed Im perfectly functional to take care of them even on Ambien I sleep great now but everyone should try to wait until they get into the bed prior to taking the pill Fortunately my worst Ambieninduced amnesia stories are waking up and thinking quotI wonder who did the dishesquot
8807,Zolpidem,Insomnia,1,39902,14,Took ambien slept for two hours woke up and vomited for hours and felt terrible all day
8808,Zolpidem,Insomnia,8,39900,20,I build tolerance to any medication really quickly so I will be able to use mg of regular Ambien for maybe a month then my doctor would up it to mg for the next month and following that he would give me Ambien CR for the rd month and then basically start all over again I have tried nearly every single other sleep aid available by prescription and non prescription and Ambien has been the only one which works for me
8809,Zolpidem,Insomnia,2,39898,24,The drug actually only worked for about five hours but I did sleep soundly However the following day after using Ambien I experienced drowsiness dizziness and stomach cramping
8810,Zolpidem,Insomnia,9,39897,30,This is very effective but TAKE ONLY RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED I did not do this once and ended up sleep walking to my car driving and rear ending someone I had no memory of doing this only found out details by reading the police report Take only as prescribed

8814,Zylet,Conjunctivitis Bacterial,7,40625,1,Helped relieve some symptoms but did not completely resolve the issues
8815,Zylet,Iritis,7,40310,9,This medicine is okay It does help the problem I haveinflammation of the eyebut I find that it works rather slow for that I would like faster results It takes several days to work and while that may not sound like a long time when you are used to wearing contacts everyday having to do eye drops for a week and wearing glasses gets annoying after days Call me spoiled by contacts I would just like relief a little faster Good medicinedoes work and does what its supposed to just takes time

8986,Viagra,Erectile Dysfunction,2,40037,99,Yes I achieved good erections after about to minutes and yes I could repeat the experience a week or two later however the side effects drove me away from it Side effects An annoyance blue tinted vision lasting about hours First Migraine like headaches No conventional medicines would relieve the pain sensitivity to light nausea and lethargyAnd the most disturbing difficulty swallowing for about hoursI ended up switching to Levitra Only a mild headache and some other minor effects for hours Not quite as good of an erection though to as good
8987,Viagra,Erectile Dysfunction,9,40019,51,Well What can I say Viagra has been great Works for about hours with very minimal side effects Only side effect I experience was a mild headache the next day Been using it for months now and I havent noticed any decreases in effectivenessstrength I am only years old though

8999,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,9,43075,1,I used Clobex spray this summer for weeks in June This gave me almost immediate clear skin on my elbows This lasted until September long sleeve season Thanks Clobex I plan on using this every summer to give me clear skin during short sleeve weather Hopefully some day they find a permanent cure for this disease
9000,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,43039,0,Worked for me
9005,Clobetasol,Dermatological Disorders,10,42845,3,Had flaking scalp for so long noting helped had to see dermatologist she prescribed Olux cant believe it but problem was gone after applications I wish I ask for help earlier
9007,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,42818,2,Clobex is in shampoo form I use that weekly Need tsp Lathers up really well I leave the shampoo on for a few hours then rinse This is a great maintenance first me between the spray applications I apply the spray on wet hairscalp so it stretches the product more bc its expensive
9009,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,42775,8,I have used both Temovate and the generic Clobetasol for the treatment of poison ivy Both were equally effective Over the counter medsointments such as caladryl and cortisone did nothing to relieve the itching and misery however as soon as applying temovate or clobetasol to the affected areas the itching was relieved and greatly reduced almost immediately Within a day the blisters were dried up and within days everything cleared up This is experience with these topical steroids over the past years Nothing else has ever worked and I tried everything including over the counter ointments lotions and Aveeno baths
9010,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,42762,6,summer of i got burnt to a crisp decided not to wear sunscreen Dumb idea after the burning and peeling of my skin came the quothells itchquot i wanted to RIP MY SKIN OFF people USE SUNSCREEN if you decide not to wear sunscreen be prepared if you want a quick solution when the itch arrives CALL A DERMATOLOGIST OFFICE make sure they accept your insurance and BEG to be seen I was prescribed clobetasol propionate solution told to use Sarna Anti itch lotion in between clobetasol usage also take an over the counter pill of zyrtec once a day and was also prescribed hydroxyzine to help me sleep And to wear COTTON clothes all the time took all that medicine due to the complexion of my skin BEST DECISION EVER
9011,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,7,42546,10,Clobetasol solution works best when I put it in a spray bottle and spray my areas and rub it in I have plaque so it takes a week on a daily basis Yes it does contain steroids and steroids are good for you to heal Im not hitting home runs a year But along side with stellara Im clear and thats all that matters
9012,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,42538,33,CLOBEX IS AMAZING It doesnt cure psoriasis but it will clear you up My scalp is bad within a week I was completely clear I could go weeks before it started to appear back on scalp I use the spray for a few days and it was goneProblem now is there is a generic so my insurance will not pay for the brand The cost of brand out of pocket is Who has that kind of money the generic does absolutely nothing for me No relief what so ever The entire insurance industry is such a crock in the USA
9013,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,42538,9,Ive tried almost everything for psoriasis in the past It was an extremely embarrassing time in my life I was at the point that I was going to ask the doctor if he could just surgically remove the areas Then I tried clobex spray Within weeks it was completely gone Being a nurse Ive run across alot of patients that I have suggested them to try this spray They have all had success and come back to thank me I even tried it on my poison ivy and it worked wonders Thank you to the makers of Clobex You have changed my life Forever grateful
9014,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,42485,12,I used it for weeks and then my Dr instructed me to stop using it for a week and by the next week my condition completely flared up again I know this medication works extremely well at treating the condition and preventing it from additional flare ups I have plantar psoriasis on the balls of both feet It starts out with bumps under the skin and in days they become big water filled blisters that are the size of a dime most of them are the size of a quarter and the largest one I had was bigger than a half dollar They were percent healed when I had to stop using it for a week and on day I felt more bumps under the skin Sure enough I have more on the ball of the same foot in the same area Good grief Its very painful
9016,Clobetasol,Eczema,10,42466,8,As most other users comment I call Clobex Spray my wonder drug at its worst my eczema results in the skin on my hands fingers covered in open weeping sores so that I have to wear cotton gloves constantly Clobex Spray clears this condition in or days But the main point of my review last time I bought Clobex it cost me a bottle this means I could rarely afford to use it I went to a different dermatologist he prescribed Clobex for supply through a specific mail order pharmacy the cost with no insurance coverage was I dont imagine I can name the pharmacy here but PLEASE if this stuff works for you get your dermatologist to do his job to find you a pharmacy where you can actually afford to buy it
9017,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,9,42444,3,This treatment is very potent and was very effective for me I think it is significantly stronger than normal steroids so I never used it for the eczema on my face However for the discoid eczema that Ive been dealing with for around a year on my hands arms and legs it has been very effective at tackling any breakouts or severe redness and scaliness For me I can normally work see the effects overnight but I find it to be most effective if used for days making sure to use emollients meanwhile and then to stop for a week or whenever next needed Definitely recommend if a weaker steroid is not working
9018,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,42343,7,I had contact dermatitis from a makeup product that caused me to break out in dry flakey red rash spots all over my face I was prescribed Clobetasol I put it on this evening and after about hours wearing this cream on my face about of the redness is gone the texture of my skin went from irritated tight dry and flaking to smooth and calm and even toned This stuff is a miracle
9020,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,7,42339,27,So like many people here I have had good results but there are a few things to point out This is s very potent steroid and needs to be used for short periods of time Its meant to knock down a flare up but is not s good long term choice It will thin the skin and cause stretch marks I know from experience Also the more you use it the less effective it becomes and overuse can cause cushings disease So Long story short it works but be careful
9023,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,42263,4,My dyshidrotic eczema has been fairly constant for the past decade Prior it was caused by food prep was a cook now it just is for no apparent reason I have used betamethazone and cordran tape with limited results Dyshidrotic eczema requires strong medicine My condition gets pretty chronic with peeling dry patches that often have persistent painful cracking Within a couple of weeks of intentional use the condition gets much better It never goes completely away but is much more manageable I apply at night most days if it has a flare up then several times a day Im not sure of all of the different ways you can get clobetasol but I use ointment If you need a medicine this strong be thankful it exists It gets it done
9024,Norfloxacin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42612,0,One week after taking a five day course of Norflox I now for past six weeks have symptoms of peripheral neuropathy my legs and arms are burning and tingling several fingers are numb yet burning sharp pain behind one knee when getting up sometimes or for no reason this is a dangerous drug do not take it in my opinion If a matter of life or death maybe
9025,Norfloxacin,Bladder Infection,10,41986,11,I was first prescribed this while on vacation in Australia It helped immediately So I asked my doctor in the U S to prescribe it so I could have it onhand for bladder infections Was lucky to have it yesterday Friday at pm after the doc was gone for the weekend and a bladder infection came on The pain burning and pressure subsided in an hour or two and its only a day treatment protocol The side effects for me are just a little feeling of fatigue Highly recommend
9026,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,42219,19,I developed serious psoriasis about years ago age Nonetheless this is the only form of treatment that truly works for me It works as well as how often you use it I sometimes find myself using it once a week and Ill have sporadic patches If I use it consistently not a spot Brilliant Although it is expensive it works so well that you can really make it last if you use it efficiently
9028,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,10,42097,9,I was prescribed and tried Triamcinolone Acetonide for several weeks which had little effect I had a previous bout of Alopecia Areata and still had a little Clobex left After reading a lot of information and just a couple days before my next appointment I tried a little on a few of the spots on my arm and they immediately started to look better The PA that was treating me was impressed enough to give me a box of OLUXE foam samples to try and the clearing effect was immediate showing major improvement in just days
9032,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,41761,39,After about a year with this I went to see a doctor amp I was just diagnosed with pustular psoriasis palms of hands and bottom of feet only Before seeing a doctor I started juicing heavily lbs no thats not a typo of carrots in three weeks amp added green juices to my regimen as well My hands had completely cleared and my feet were almost completely clear But because of another issue I went to my doctor and because of the then upcoming tests I backed off of my juicing completely The psoriasis came back on my hands and feet While I wasnt juicing I figured I would find out what it was Doc gave me the Clobex spray For the immediate painful inflammation problems in my feet caused by the psoriasis this stuff is AWESOME
9033,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,41758,31,Works best when applied at night before sleep Good for use on the body Not for face or other sensitive skin areas Ive only been using it for a couple of months but the results are better than any other products that Ive used in the past
9034,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,41719,38,I have poison ivy every year for the last yrs I have seen drs emergency rooms and they never help me they only told me to used Benadryl I have it infected and nobody ever prescribe anything It last for more than a month but this year I went to see a new doctor and he prescribed this cream for me and as soon he applied to my rash I feel the difference is like magic I went Wednesday night and today is Friday and is almost drying out Finally something works for me Im so happy expensive but worth it
9038,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,41579,18,After just days of using this Im starting to see significant clearing on the inside of my elbow where a stress rash got out of control I might not need to even use it for the whole weeks and be able to save it for next time
9039,Clobetasol,Lichen Sclerosus,10,41574,26,BRAND TEMOVATE works generic does not From personal experience and that of a friend I had brand she had generic I am cured she is not Also hormone replacement orally and topically of estrogen plus testosterone helped greatly with the cure I keep the area clean using liquid soap plus Hibiclens After drying I lightly use Nystop powder I apply the topicals x daily I can again enjoy sex climaxing and also have a normal lifejust like I used to have I had to appeal my insurance decision to get brand Temovate
9040,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,41522,19,Works well if you are PreMenopausal Menopausal or PostMenopausal and has experienced itch around vagina due to dryness hot flashes and night sweats Highly recommended
9042,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,9,41459,30,It help me a lot with my rash scalp and hair loss
9043,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,10,41404,10,Relieves symptom and heals completely temporarily Then lesions come back and need to treat again until healed Cycling breakouts
9045,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,9,41280,26,I have been using Clobex spray for nearly years It is the best so far My psoriasis is on my scalp elbows and small spots here and there on my body The Spray is the wonderful real easy to use for applying to my scalp at odd angels
9046,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,9,41198,9,It works very well The only thing I dislike about it is that I have to use it less than I am supposed to otherwise I run out too fast and have to go without
9047,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,41181,21,THIS SHAMPOO IS A MIRACLE My entire life I have dealt with extreme itching and dandruff with red bumps on my scalp The first time I used it I was healed No itching at all I recommend to anyone with these symptoms
9048,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,5,41130,10,Great for itching but not for clearing plaque scalp psoriasis
9049,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,9,41034,15,This medicine works to clear my psoriasis almost
9052,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,43024,0,I had a headache for weeks straight and couldnt figure out why so I finally broke down and went to the doctors yesterday She prescribed me Ceftin and said I had a sinus infection I took both pills yesterday and woke up today with no headache at all and feeling amazing This pill really works so far
9054,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,1,42991,0,I will NEVER take this antibiotic again I took one dose and four hours later I was throwing up to the point of dry heaves I was so extremely nauseous that I was miserable After I was finished throwing up for three hours I proceeded to have the worst watery stools ever Just keeping it real people I had to go to the ER because I started to feel weak and weird I passed out as they wheeled me to a room where they thought I had appendicitis Did blood work and CT Nope it was the medication I was severely dehydrated and they told me by the time I had left that I looked times better than when I went in I havent had anymore of the medication and Ive been just fine Id suffer through a sinus infection than go through that again
9055,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42976,6,When I read all of the reviews I was kind of terrified to start Ceftin but I had no reason to be The only side effect I found for the first day was gas and bloating but it definitely couldve been unrelated As long as you take this antibiotic with a meal nothing crazy doesnt have to be huge and take probiotics daily you should be totally fine Ive been on it for days and I feel great with no side effects Tomorrow is my last day so Im hoping my UTI will be cleared out My only complaint is that because I took the liquid it definitely was not pleasant to swallow and I found the easiest way to make it tolerable was to mix it with a sweeter flavored drink as the antibiotic is a bit gritty and bitter
9056,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42835,5,I came down with a UTI on My Primary Care Provider couldnt get me in so I ended up going to Urgent Care on as I couldnt stand to suffer any longer I have compromised kidneys so nearly every time I get a UTI it develops into a kidney infection The Urgent Care doctor prescribed me Cefuroxime I was surprised when I picked it up from the pharmacy because it wasnt the same antibiotic that I normally get prescribed for my UTIkidney infections Today is and I still feel absolutely awful It seems to be having no effect Im used to feeling better relatively quickly with the other antibiotic that Im normally prescribed I guess Ill be heading back to the doctor this week
9059,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,42681,14,Effective antibiotic with the only down side being frequent heartburn amp gas
9060,Cefuroxime,Otitis Media,6,42674,2,I had the worst and most painful experience of my freakin life having a double ear infection I went to my local urgent care and the doctor prescribed Amoxicillin ampthis made it SO MUCH WORSE After days of the amoxicillin I was hysterically crying from the pain So I went back to urgent care and saw a different doctor he prescribed me Cefuroxime amp some ear drops I am on day of this antibiotic and the pain is nothing like it was before but I am still feeling it Frankly Ive had a broken nose too many sinus infections to count etc and NOTHING compares to the severity of the pain that this ear infection caused me I am still in pain but just not as much THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE is a warm compress or ice pack to help with pain
9062,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,3,42652,3,Reduced severity of but didnt clear up a lung infection of unknown bacterial origin
9063,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,4,42644,2,Just started ceftin for infection of inner ear Taken twice daily for only full dayssome relief from pain but ear is still severely stopped up Almost no hearing in that ear except my own hheartbeat rather annoying but beats the alternative Have seen many complaints of bad gastrointestinal problems my suggestion is take probiotics while on drug I have no problem with taking it Note take at least an hour apart from antibiotics Works well for me Hope my ear unstops soon
9065,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,1,42604,11,Ive been suffering from acute sinusitis for days now The doctor gave me antibiotics to nip it in the bud before it becomes chronic Im on my th day of Cefuroxime Axetil mg x per day and I feel no better In fact my condition continues to worsen There is more greenish yellow mucous Im beginning to cough up mucous and sinus headaches are starting My doctor refuses to change the antibiotic because he says it can take anywhere from day to over a week to work I have to give it more days Truly disappointed with this medication
9067,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,9,42595,11,Have gotten excellent results with this med It takes three days to kick in but it has killed a sinus infection in both and I have allergies so have more problems than most in getting the infection to go completely away I have not had the digestive issues nor any other side effects that I have with other meds like zpack I still take yogart daily to keep good bacteria in the digestive tractIt seems to not have the issue with antibiotic resistance that zpack and some of the things more commonly prescribed can cause
9068,Cefuroxime,Lyme Disease,5,42562,2,son of years old has Lyme received cefuroxime axetil mg oral suspension days It was hard to find pharmacy that carries this The pediatrician had to mediate Our son did a great job taking the medicine as we used a plastic injection tof administer it to him He did fine with that However On the bottle it said to shake well before use The liquid was too thick for shaking You had to just wait for the goo to come out of the narrow bottle When the bottle was quotemptyquot there was a thick layer at the bottom and around the sides Even thicker than the rest How can we tell if he got the right amount of medicine Better to put susp into an open neck jar and stir each time With Lyme youquotre never sure if medication worked
9069,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,42509,13,I suffer from sever sinus issues almost monthly and this is the best antibiotic I have ever taken days into the meds and felt better Thank god I have finally found soetching that will help me feel better within days
9070,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42446,13,Omg this is the worst antibiotic ever I almost finished a whole two weeks supply and felt no better Ive been back too the doctor times since using this antibiotic it did nothing for my pain or me hopefully sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim works better
9072,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,7,42412,8,I have an upper respiratory infection I have been on this medication for full days so far and my fever is gone and my cough is a lot better its definitely effective the only problem is the side affects are awful Im extremely dizzy and have real low energy This stuff works but it sucks the life out of you
9075,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,1,42361,6,My mother age took this After days she became very confused bad chest pain nauseated felt jerky and diarrhea She still shows some confusion after being off of it for days
9076,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,42349,16,I typically get two bad sinus infections every year and have tried many different antibiotics but this med seems to work very well for me After a few days I start to feel better but I must continue the Meds for at least four more days or I will have a relapse to my sinus infection
9077,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,5,42347,17,Did excellent job with clearing up sinus infection days in however I got hit with pretty severe diarrhea Dr had me stop taking since I was so much improved in terms of the sinusitis and due to the side effects Been hrs of diarrhea And since I terminated the medication Hopefully it resolves with the probiotics Im taking and cessation of the Ceftin I am concerned about the severe colitis Ive read about but we shall see
9078,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,42346,19,I was prescribed this drug for persistant sinusitus After the first dose my symptoms were gone No yeast infection from it either Works wonderfully
9079,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,6,42288,4,My doctor looked in my ear and nose and saw that they were severe blocked as well as infected with bacteria He explained to me that I probably have drainage into the eustachian tube and that has got dirty So he prescribed me mg Ceftin as well as AllegraD and Flonase all to be taken for days I take Ceftin twice daily morning and night with food I take AllegraD and Flonase in the morning before I leave for work I dont know how the Ceftin works but I was still plugged up for a good days until it felt like it may be finally kicked in But is it It could just be the regular AllegraD and Flonase But I guess if this Ceftin is good for many other stuff itll be good for all the other bacteria type stuff so Im happy
9080,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,42249,19,I have tried different sinus medications over the years and this seems to be the best of them all Just pills a day breakfast and dinner no noticeable negative effects Cured my bout of sinusitis in about days but I continued to take it for the full days
9081,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,2,42232,13,I have a terrible tastesmelllike something electrical Doctor said I have a sinus infection This medicine has had no effect at all Positive or negative I just finished one week of mg tablets daily Doctor said to refill after a week if I dont see any results

9086,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,6,42039,2,One of the best antibiotics for meI was amazed how well it worked Down side taste is horrible but thats probably why its so goodMy side effects were plentiful but the risks outweighed the badMy biggest side effect was nausea and vomiting there were lots of moments I had to run to a bathroom or get out of a moving vehicleWith all that Im still grateful I was sicker then ever beforeI slept last night fully for the first time in almost weeks If like me one of your symptoms are no appetite either force feed yourself or find an alternative with your doctorIm sure being able to eat wouldve helped ease my stomachFeel betterHad some dizziness and vaginitis

9098,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,1,41222,13,After day noticed my lips burning thought it was just chapped lips bought a tube of lip balm On day noticed tiny blisters forming on my bottom lip and by the end of the day my bottom lip was beginning to swell I quit using the lip balm but my lips continue to swell and burn I developed a terribly deep but empty cough which I did not have before starting this prescription This cough occurs while at rest not while talking eating or exercising Also soaking night sweats mainly from my head I did not read the side effects on the prescription

9102,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,43060,1,I have been on this for a little more then a year I was prescribed this pill because I have an extreme sensitivity to birth control I had mild nausea the first week and then it was gone I noticed spotting through out the entire year I also noticed if I forgot to take my pill and it was the next day I would have cramping and what felt like the start of my period I had clear skin and no bloating on this pill Appetite and sex drive were normal and no weight gain This is a very mild pill for those that have extreme sensitivity I would stay on it but I switched insurance
9103,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,43058,0,Im halfway into my second month Ive been on my period for more than weeks My acne is horrible now Worse than ever I hate this pill It does keep me from getting pregnant but thats not what I wanted completely I have endometriosis and acne prone skin My gyno told me itd help but it totally hasnt Cant wait to get something different
9105,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,43056,0,This is only my second week on this pill and even though Irsquom not sure how it works with periods it has done wonders for my skin Any acne I used to have is completely clearing out and no new ones are popping back up On top of that I havenrsquot gained any weight and if anything I have almost gone up a whole cup size
9107,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,43052,2,Horrible horrible mental side effects dizziness and nausea abdominal pain HORRIBLE migraines to the point of going to ER for pain control Lets go back to the mental side effects made me a completely different person I was mean to everybody My family actually told me to leave the house to give them a break from my irritability Deep depression and Im on meds for that already so not a good med for me I stuck it out for months and decided to stop it when my husband actually hid the pills from me
9108,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,43052,0,This is the only birth control Ive ever been on so I dont have a point of comparison but I dont think its helpful at all I started it because I was having periods every two weeks for about months Im in my third month of taking it and not only do I still randomly get my period in the middle of the month but if I am so much as minutes early or late taking the pill in the morning Ill get my period again I already had depression and it made it so much worse than it already was that I had to go back into therapy Acne is no better or worse I guess the only thing it did right was that it sort of made my cramps better And then not to mention the fact that even after insurance its still which I cant afford every month
9109,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,43048,2,I took this pill after I had my daughter The only thing it was good for was preventing pregnancy and little to no cycle I had NO SEX DRIVE I was moody always crying gained weight depressed etc Literally a week after I got off I felt like a new normal person again and Ive dropped the weight I wont be taking again Almost ruined my relationship
9110,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,43048,2,Ive always been one for depo but my doctor advised me to try lolo I agreed The first months worth I didnt like and questioned a lot of things Seemed like I had a never ending period all over the place and lasted for days My breast were really tender felt very nauseated to the point of almost vomiting pelvic cramps mild mood swings UTI discharge When I went on antibiotics for the UTI I was told the pill will be less effective my doctor never considered my age as a factor which puts me at more of a risk I am losing weight I can not maintain I Not happy with this product not enough testing and Im going back to depo
9111,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,43047,2,I was put on the birth control because I had a very large fibroid that caused me to have a blood transfusion This pill saved my life until I was able to have surgery The only negative thing I experienced was a little weight gain no more than lbs My periods went from extremely heavy lasting days to very light only lasting and a half days to staying completely off And for someone who was dangerously anemic Ill take not having a period
9114,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,43037,6,One of the first birth controls I was put on for never ending periods It definitely controlled my bleeding but I went from about lbs to lbs in the span of around months My hair did great on this pill and so did my skin but I eventually switched because of the constant hunger weight gain I can definitely see how it would be good for some women but not all
9116,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,43034,5,I am always bleeding between periods Irsquove also gained pounds and on a skinny girl itrsquos very noticeable My acne hasnrsquot got worse or better And now Irsquom not getting my period when I should be I am experiencing depression where I donrsquot want to be around anyone I donrsquot want to eat because Irsquom gaining so much weight Irsquom stuck in my head and lashing out at people Irsquom not my normal self I wish I found a pill that rids my acne and doesnrsquot affect my weight or sex drive
9117,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,43033,2,I am very surprised many women are having problems with this pill This pill has stopped all my cramping and been amazing You will get side effects the first months but after that it will be really good No period is a plus for me
9119,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,43025,10,Wow I absolutely love this pill Im so sorry that so many other women had a problem with it After reading the reviews I felt compelled to write one of my own because I was hesitant to take it after reading all of the horror stories Ive been on bc for years several different pills No complaints However I switched to this one after talking to my obgyn about my loooonnnnnnggggg periods Well Ive been on Lo Loestrin for months now and absolutely love it Hardly any cramps and my period has gone down to days of mostly light spotting Love this pill
9123,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,43016,1,This was a horrible experience Irsquove been on Ortho tricyclen lo before as well since I was Irsquom now and I was on lolo for months before I stopped because I literally lost at least of my hair It made me really depressed and caused several panic attacks a week The only thing it was good at was not getting me pregnant It didnrsquot even help my periods
9124,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,43010,6,Ive been on this pill for years now At first I would only get spotting from month to month After the first few months my period stopped altogether I have side effects I wondered if my lowered sex drive was a cause of the pill but I recently ended my relationship and realized it was not the pill Everyone is different but I wish all had similar experiences to me Absolutely love this pill and have no desire to switch or take anything else was on generess fe before loloestrin which gave me sharp stabbing pains in the chest near my heart Once I switched the pains went away
9125,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,43008,3,Good Hardly bled at all very little cramping no babiesBad Mood swings extremely sore breasts increased acne and oily skinI am sad to have to quit this drug but I cannot stand having such sore breasts all the time Took the drug for months
9126,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,3,41117,15,After days of a ten day treatment plan I developed vaginal bleeding I not prone nor have I ever experienced bleeding between periods Dizziness lack of ability to concentrate
9127,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,1,41051,32,This was prescribed to me for a sinus infection After days of use I felt no change in my condition This medication did not work for me My dosage was tablets by mouth twice a day Tablets were mg
9128,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,10,40910,67,I was prescribed this after days on a Azithromycin was making me worse My doctor told me the Zpack wasnt working because my bronchitis had become pneumonia After days on the Ceftin mg twice daily I was really starting to improve My cough had lessened chest congestion had loosened nicely and my headachestuffiness had started to subside I also used a humidifierNow days in and Im feeling almost human The cough is almost gone I can breathe almost normally and am much improved I have always heard the Zpack knocks out almost everything but Im proof its not a cureallOne thing to note is that Ceftin can be rough on your stomach so be sure to take it with food Crackers toast or yogurt should be fine
9130,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,40855,75,I had a sinus infection with fever spiking higher at night took me a while to figure out because I never had one before Within a day of taking Ceftin I no longer had a fever and felt much better Had no problem taking the pill with water unlike others dont taste it at all After days I still have thick mucus and less appetite than usual but otherwise am doing much better than before I notice no side effects from this medicine
9132,Cefuroxime,Tonsillitis/Pharyngitis,9,40704,16,It quickly helped get rid of the infection in my throat BUT it is very hard to take The taste of the pill is horrible and sticks around for a long time in the back of your throat I used flavored yogurt to help counteract the flavor after I swallowed the pill It also starts dissolving quickly so it tended to get stuck in my throat
9133,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,8,40600,41,The bitter taste made the pills almost impossible to take Dipping them in honey really worked Thanks so much for that tip
9134,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9,40598,28,Ive used this and in days it helps you greatly and I have COPD
9135,Cefuroxime,Lyme Disease,9,40447,43,Experienced immediate relief from foggy brain ended headaches and muscle and joint pain
9136,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,1,40191,32,I was put on Ceftin for a sinus infection days later I developed terrible diarrhea with blood found out it was called pseudomembraneous colitis It is now a week later and I am still suffering from the side effects
9137,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,40128,64,I have been dealing with bad breathe for about year and been to my internal medicine doctor and my dentist and they said I was fine I wasnt ok with this answer so I went to see an ENT doctor He then prescribed me Ceftin mg tablets to take twice a day with food This is the miracle drug I have only been taking it for wks out of the wks I was prescribed the drug and can already tell a difference I go back in week to have a CT scan of my sinuses to see if the bacterial infection has cleared up I would recommend this to anyone who is suffering with the symptoms it treats
9138,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,2,40118,17,I went to the emergency room with a sinus infection on a Monday and picked up a bottle of Ceftin a few hours later By the following Sunday nothing had changed I still had the aches dizziness and bouts of confusion and disorientation that had sent me to the hospital in the first place
9142,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,9,39985,63,After being hospitalized for weeks and on other magantibiotics I am so pleased to report that after days on the Ceftin I finally could stop going through a count box of tissues EVERY day and could actually breathe through my nose most of the time My ENT Doctor prescribed Ceftin for days Ive been on it now for days I have a severely depressed immune system due to MDS We want to avoid surgery at all costs I am hoping and praying the relief continues I am also on Astepro nasal spray Hoping for no or minimal side effects which is always a concern So far so good Will try and further evaluate at end of regimen I hope this helps someone else
9143,Cefuroxime,Lyme Disease,8,39962,34,Only complaint is that it has a very bitter taste helpful totake with food Also recommend taking a good probiotic to avoid getting diarrheacolitis
9144,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,39877,29,I was amazed that this antibotic started taking effect after the nd dose mg xday I have completed days of and although my head and ears still feel full I can breath through my nose have been sleeping through the night and have my energy level back I am extremely pleased
9145,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,10,39824,166,I am on my th day of day prescription taking mg in the morning and mg before bedtime The pills are hard to swallow and taste awful so I dip them in honey before taking It works great Ceftin is working great Being a person that has lived with nasty sinus infections most of my life I never take the same antibotic twice in one year However Ceftin is at the top of my list It cures the infection Make sure you take a ten day mg daily course if you have a bad infection It does make you feel bad it is hard on your stomach so you must take it with food Yoghurt or Activa is a must and also make sure you have a bunch of bananas on hand Good luck
9146,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,9,39696,80,days ago I was diagnosed with urinary tract infection and was prescribed cefuroxime axetil mg x a day After the first capsule the severe symptoms of infection were gone Although Ive experienced light headedness and some anxiety after the morning dose I think its worth it compared to the pain and anxiety experienced during the infection
9149,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,10,39589,32,I had sinusitis bronchitis and pink eye After two dosesMG I was feeling good I will finish all pills of course
9150,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42959,6,When I first started taking this birth control it was great My periods stopped and I only had some spotting the first month or so About twothree months in though I felt like it made me lose my sex drive a lot and had no libido On top of this I noticed I had a lot of vaginal dryness even before having sex and this made doing anything sexual not that pleasurable I also gained a few pounds after beginning the pill I didnt experience any change in my acne though as it is a possible side effect of this particular birth control
9151,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42958,2,I started this BC at and just went off of it a few months ago at age to one that would help my skin BIG MISTAKE I did not realize how great Lo Loestrine fe was until I was on a new one I experienced virtually no side effects other than not getting a period whatsoever even the first pack which I loved Other than that I felt absolutely no different and while Im sad it didnt help my skin at all Im starting to think that moderate acne is pretty small in comparison to all the negative side effects I have on my new pill I think I will be switching back to LoLo
9152,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42957,3,This is THE BEST birth control Ive come across Im seriously blown away I have had zero mood swings even near my period I had break through bleeding the first month and that was it my periods are already so light and Im only on the third month my face cleared right up and has been less oily Ive lost weight Im on cloud nine I have never had this well of an experience on birth control as Im very sensitive to medications
9153,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42953,4,When I started taking Lo Loestrin Fe it was great It cleared up my skin I didnt get pregnant I didnt have any periods it was AWESOME About months into it I started seeing a major decrease in my sex drive I was extremely moody and depressed my husband and I fought pretty much on a daily basis needless to say I stopped taking it after my annual prescription ran out I only took it because our insurance covered the entire cost But after seeing the effects it had on not just me but my marriage I refuse to ever take this medication again I HATE this birth control and I wouldnt recommend anyone taking it
9154,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42949,2,Only on it two months and its ruined my life First month was horrible Bad cystic acne never had acne before this in my life on my forehead and horrible mood swings Then I got use to the hormones and those symptoms went away End of my second month I lost tons of hair Im talking clumps would fall out Then came the bald spots I freaked and quit the pill that day Now I have to use rogaine and take tons of supplements to treat my hair My hair was healthy not chemically touched long and full Now its patchy thin has broken off it looks horrible I had to cut my hair to hide a huge bald patch right where some if my bangs use to be
9155,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42948,3,I am years old and I have been on this for over a year now I tried other birth control pills before this one but the estrogen levels were way too high my boobs got bigger and I got extremely moody Loloestrin was so much better Since it has such a small dose of both hormones I havent noticed any negative side effects The first couple of months I had dark sticky discharge especially during menstration time however since then I have not had a period My gynecologist says this is okay at my age and not something to worry about Overall I am very happy with this birth control
9156,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42946,3,Ok so Ive been on it for months two years ago and I felt really confused disoriented and fuzzy So now I went on this birth control again and the SAME THING Now I know what its from its this birth control I feel really weird at work I would get in this state where Im just confused and Im always sooo tired on it Other than that it would have been a great pill to stay on because it didnt make me gain or lose weight and my periods were much lighter Anyone else feel like this though Im going to stop taking it today
9159,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42941,0,I originally asked my doctor for a birth control pill with the least amount of hormones because I did not want my period to completely stop I have always had very irregular and heavy periods She said this would make them lighter and more regular Over the course of a year this pill made my periods almost inexistent I would get it maybe once every months and usually only lasted a day My sex drive was gone I gained pounds even thought I never really had much of an appetite I was depressed and anxious all the time The only good thing about it was it cleared up my skin I use Junel Fe now but I still have similar side effects so Im going to talk to my doctor about switching again
9160,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42940,2,Ive been on this birth control for almost two months now Im yo and this is the third contraceptive I have tried and its worked the best so far Ive had terrible side effects to every birth control method I have tried And so far the only problem with this one is the acne I have always had mild acne growing up but it eventually went away Ive noticed since starting my first pack the acne has started coming back But compared to how badly my body has reacted to other methods this is nothing So far a great choice for me
9164,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42938,2,I started this birth control about a week ago and days Today I will NOT ever be taking this pill again and calling my doctor come Monday morning I took this pill after doing some research and seeing if maybe the cause of my severe depression and anxiety was hormonally related My gynecologist didnt ask me any questions about my past hospitalizations due to suicidal thoughtsattempts I read front and back this medication and only saw suicidal thoughts as side effects to the higher dose Let me tell you this pill made everything heightened My anxiety has never been so bad I took lexapro and trazedon together for months and stopped because I couldnt function as a regular person Talk with your psychiatrist amp gyno before taking
9166,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42931,8,I have been on this birth control for months and it has been great I had breakthrough bleeding the first couple months but now I dont have any bleeding or period I have lost pounds because I dont have an appetite anymore so that is great I weigh pounds now so another would be great I am definitely staying on this pill
9167,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42929,5,Ive taken this pill for about six years now and it is a miracle worker No periods no side effects
9169,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42927,7,THE WORST My hair fell out I was an emotional disaster I made poor decisions and my brain felt fuzzy What an awful time My period didnt even come so I didnt know if I was pregnant or not What a terrible drug Hopefully Ill find something better next time
9170,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42926,5,Made me lose around percent of my hair The hair I did have was thin and corse No side effects other wise but that was enough to scare me away Most doctors dont inform you on how birth control can make you lose hair but it certainly can
9171,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42926,9,This pill is great I have been on it for nearly years without any major problems I started this pill solely because my bleeding was so heavy I couldnt maintain my everyday routine when I was on my period Now I do not get a period whatsoever which is AMAZING I have had no weight gain no breakouts amp no mood swings The only drawback low sex drive
9173,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42921,2,I was on Lo Loestrin Fe for almost years and they were the worst years of my life First of all my periods completely stopped as far as bleeding went no bleeding But I experienced all the other effects of a period such as bloating cramps PMS The couple times I actually had my period while on this pill I had yeast infectionlike symptoms to which my gynecologist said was normal and horrendous cramping Also before Lo Loestrin I never experienced PMS and after it I did I will start Taytulla so I hope this one works better
9174,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42920,4,I think this was the worst pill I could have ever tooken It caused my periods to stop completely and also my sex drive was GONE Cause issue with me and my husband and also caused hair loss Yes Im years old and my hair is falling out Im talking about my hair is falling out in chunks Not like one or two strands no I cant even brush my hair anymore
9175,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,43000,3,I have only been on the pill for a month and wks which isnrsquot enough time to have a accurate opinion but Irsquom going to share anyways The st month I started the first day of my period and it stopped it completely days later I had brown discharge that eventually turned into a full on bleed I bled for about days and experienced some of the worst cramps ever My periods are usually awful the only thing that made these better was that it wasnrsquot a constant awfulness When it stopped everything was great no acne no anything I got my period the same month on the last white pill and it ended on the last brown pill of those days were semiheavy but very tolerable days into my second pack I started breaking out on my forehead ampchin
9176,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,43000,12,I have nothing bad to say This is my first time taking any birth control so maybe Im a little biased I was very hesitant to take any birth control due to the known side effects that come along with most oral contraceptives However after two separate ruptured ovarian cysts my OBGYN said birth control is really the only way to prevent it in the future Ive been taking it a little over months now no weight gain no acne no mood changes no loss of libido AND my periods are so light now mostly spotting no cramps and a shorter duration I definitely recommend this
9177,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42999,5,I was put on this BC by an army provider because I have severe ovarian cysts and the WORST periods I took it for about months The only side effects Ive had are some mood swings and I literally cried about everything I got off it for a while because of training reasons and Im just starting it again Im two weeks into my first pack and Im still loving it Less side effects than last time give this birth control a chance
9178,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42998,5,Theres a character limit so bullet pointsBeen on this monthsBad mood swings in the beginning but they went awaycleared up acne on my backhave had periods in the middle of a pack so my body hasnt adjusted to that yetThis BC worried me at first but now Im finding it to be positive My overall moods are MUCH better
9179,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42997,1,Im years old to anyone who wants a teenagers perspective Ive been on this pill for months now amp I really like it The first week of taking this pill I was a little nauseous I have really bad chronic depression amp extreme anxiety amp this contraceptive doesnt effect my moods whatsoever I did gain a little bit of weight but I have always been really small so weight gain didnt bother me Ive noticed a big increase in appetite My acne has gone unphased Ive read that a lot of people have lost their sex drive while on this birthcontrol but it is the exact opposite for me Unfortunately Ive noticed some vaginal dryness during sex which is terrible But its lessened my periods to two days each month I strongly recommend
9182,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42993,5,This birth control has worked very well for me Ive tried other oral contraceptives in the past all for months each and I tried the Skyla IUD for months All of those ended up absolutely ruining my body my clear skin and my moods I became borderline suicidal My OBGYN recommended me this brand due to its low hormone levels and the fact that it is mostly estrogen based Ive still been having some spotting still months in but thats my only real complaint My skin has stayed clear my sex drive is normal and I havent gained any weight The fact that its SO EXPENSIVE sucks though per monthI wish I could get it free like the other forms of birth control Ive gotten in the past
9183,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42992,4,Best birth control pill Ive tried More expensive but less symptoms than others no bleeding no bloating no weight gain no emotional effects despite being on it for years No periods either which is great The periods from other pills are not actually periods and are not needed
9185,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42990,6,I am in my s I wanted to try this pill to control my very heavy periods I was a little worried after hearing all the stories I had a little bit of break out bleeding in the second month but other wise no side effects The first few months I had a light period for days each month I only needed pantyliners I am on my fourth month and I had no period I highly recommend this BC It worked great for me I love it
9186,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42989,2,My doctor suggested that I take birth control so I decided to try out the pills first She prescribed me lo loestrin Fe and I took it for about months before I decided to throw them away My acne became really horrible I had never had cystic acne in my life My skin has still not cleared up which is a real bummer and Im pretty sure Im going to remain with scars Overall it did its job at preventing pregnancy My period spotted for a few days the first month and I didnt have a period the remaining months It was really great without period pains also I am now going to try an implant and change the hormonal balances to tray and clear my skin ugh
9188,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42988,1,Stay very far away from this birth control This birth control was recommended to me by a doctor at the time it was only on the market a few months so I was bit iffy on trying it Anyways I went through with it and well let me tell you this birth control is like no other It started with me being very moody but towards the end I was just so down and my depression got so bad I had to get off this pill The worst of the worst about it is I do not have periods anymore I started spotting and spotting more as the months went by then bam one month I just never had them Its been years since Ive been off this medicantion my depression is still ongoing and I do not have periods anymore This pill did permanent damage to my ovaries
9190,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42980,6,I would highly recommend lo lo I have been on it only Months and Im very happy with the results I was on depo provera for almost four years and left me with pre menopause symptoms and had to get off it Tried three kinds ofBirth control and all made me gain weight and mood swings I tried about months no bc and the depo side effects made my life and sex life miserable Consistent discharge and smell sorry about the vulgar details my sex life with my bf was a mess I was prescribed lo lo and I have not had a problem since I had my period the first month second month was a week late lasted days by the third month no period and I am not pregnant yay Im and has to b the best contraceptive I have ever taken
9193,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42975,1,I took Lo Loestrin Fe for years and honestly loved it I switched briefly to the generic version for a month and it was freaking awful so I switched back to Lo Lo right away Only issue I encountered on it was that I ovulated over the BC which resulted in extreme breast tenderness amp growth for about weeks and weight gain When this first happened to me I really thought I was pregnant after a test came out negative I went to my OBGYN and she explained that it was too low a hormone level to properly regulate my cycle Hence the ovulation So then I switched to generic and ended up just switching back again I finally stopped taking Lo Lo after the nd time I ovulated over the pills and got an IUD Overall though great BC
9194,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42970,1,Ive been on this birth control for a month and needless to say its been a nightmare I had clear skin before starting and for this entire month Ive had cystic pimples all along my jaw line and neck and pimples around my mouth and chin My boobs swelled A LOT and they always hurt my mood swings are horrendous and to top it off I bled for weeks straight Sorry but I dont have the patience to wait months or longer for that kind of stuff to level out Ill be discontinuing
9196,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42967,16,Im a year old for anyone who wants a teenagers perspective of this pill This is a very good birth control and I havent had any crazy side affects I just finished my first pack and waiting for my next one The only issue I have so far was starting my period over a week early but it was a very light period which was good And also Ive been having dark discharge a little over a week but it is said to be normal within the first months of taking this pill Other than that I feel very normal and I havent seen much of a change with my body besides the early light period Younger women taking this pill will probably have less side affects than older women and I havent seen any reviews for girls around my age so I hope this helps
9197,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42967,2,Terrible Broke out in really bad acne five pimples on my face within a week of taking it I normally have very clear skin Skin in general has become an oil slick Much more emotional than usual and started crying at a concert after two drinks Hungrier than normal I think about food a lot and Ive already gained a few lbs Fell asleep one night without taking my pill By the time I woke up my period had started and I proceeded to spot for the next week despite religiously continuing to take my pill at the exact same time I quit This sucks On the plus side Im sure that this works well as birth control I am unlikely to get pregnant as I am broken out puffy emotional and continuously on my period Thanks Lolo
9199,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42961,3,Well Im on my first pack in my nd row bleeding still my doc say I just started so give it time I just wanna stop bleeding my boobs are sore other then that havent notice any other side affects Yet I do have some light cramping in my uterus Can someone help me should I give it a chance since its my first pack or give up
9200,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42919,4,Ive been on this pill for about years and Im writing this while mournfully staring at the end of my last pack my insurance changed and its no longer covered Even in the beginning my symptoms were mild besides the usual spotting My periods went from weeklong horribly heavy and painful to barely noticeable extremely light and only days long Ive always had some mild anxietydepression issues on and off so I cant say there was any change one way or the other there I do suspect it fixed my sleep schedule though I have always struggled SEVERELY with insomnia and around the time I went on this pill I started having a normal human sleep schedule I cant think of any other explanation but I guess Ill find out for sure now
9202,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42911,10,This was my first birth control but Ive got to say that it is probably the best birth control you can get since it has the lowest dosage of estrogen which means you have the least side effects SINCE it has such a low dosage its pretty dang priceyThe first month on this birth control is rough and your first period will be a VERY bad period if you react to it like I did I was bedridden from cramps and I bled a lot but honestly I was used to it since the reason Im taking it is because of nasty periods After the first period it was AMAZING My periods lasted days barely any bleeding zero cramps and I had no side effects No weight gain no acne no mood swings or nausea Its wonderful I highly recommend this birth control
9205,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42902,11,The first and only hormonal birth control Ive tried and its A for me Ive been on it for a few months now and the only side effect Ive had is my boobs getting noticeably larger and fuller I havent experienced any weight gain or mood swings and I havent had a period since I started it I experienced a tiny bit of breakthrough bleeding the first month and then it was smooth sailing from there My skin is completely clear of acne and I feel like I dont break out as easily as I used to My sex drive has also been through the roof although I did still have a high libido before starting the pill Overall I find this to be a great pill and it feels great not having to buy tampons anymore
9207,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42899,7,After a few years of not being on birth control I decided I needed to go back on it because the out of control mood swings and irrationality during PMS paired with the completely dibilitating back pain I was experiencing during the first two days of my period were ruining my life Month rough Crazy emotions for the first two weeks I could barely sleep for the first days My skin and hair got very oily and I got a couple pimples which I never do My boobs got bigger without weight gainMonth spotted for day instead of a period but still had PMS mood No back pain Skin and hair A No weight gainIn the months since then I havent bled or PMS at all but my back pain is starting to come back in waves so I might discontinue
9209,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42898,3,The cost of each pack was a bit shocking when I first started it The discount program the company offers is not applicable if you have insurance It would have cost over per pack out of pocket but now cost me about I have never paid over per pack with other BC after insurance Ive been taking it for about a half of a year after I stopped nursing my firstborn I cannot remember the last time I had a period but my doc says of patients dont get a period on LLF This makes me paranoid that Im pregnant Also I have had an increased appetite and have gained back lbs that I worked really hard to lose postpartum I wake up feeling very tired every day but my energy is fine once I get going No sex drive either
9210,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42895,4,I took Lo Loestrin for mo with horrible side effects the entire time My Dr wanted me to stick it out for months before switching to give my body time to get used to it It was the worst mo of my life I was nauseous CONSTANTLY especially with physical exercise I would have to sit down from walking because I would get to dizzy nauseous from it I started the pills on Day of my period and then bled the ENTIRE MO Not just spotting either The only time it was spotting was for the days when I was supposed to get my period each month the rest of the time was HORRIBLE heavy bleeding The worst part though was the anxiety and depression I cried every every single day Couldnt get out of bed and had anxiety attacks Ended up switching pills
9212,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42888,6,I am on my second pack and will not be starting the third one I was so happy to start the pill because I thought I wouldnt see nearly as much blood as I usually do but I was wrong I had the worst breakthrough bleeding I bleed for almost a month straight and some days it was heavy enough for a tampon and some it was just panty liners and as soon as it went away my period would come I had bad back pain Some nights I cant even sleep it hurts so bad I also do not even feel like myself anymore I would honestly rather not even be on the pill then have to take this again
9213,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42887,4,Was originally on Gildess when it was switched to Blisovi Had no complaints from that switch Was actually able to lose some weight Then switched from Blisovi to Lo Loestrin I believe because my doctor thought it might help my periods be more regular and predictable because I go for months without a period Was on it for a couple weeks and was so tired I could hardly function and was also bloated For someone with a sleeping disorder this is bad The pill is the only thing that changed and that I could think was causing the extreme fatigue And Lo Loestrin costed me for three months which is outrageous to me Will be going back to Blisovi
9216,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42880,8,DO NOT TAKE THIS Have been taking it for a year and now I find out I am PREGNANT Took it everyday at the same time DOES NOT WORK
9217,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42878,2,My obgyn prescribed me this Took it for about a month or a little less made me moody break out when my acne hadnt broken out in over a year Decrease in sex drive Completely stopped taking it
9218,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42877,6,I was recommended this Birth control method by my Gyno after having an Ovarian Cyst removed I was taking another kind of pill and it was going horribly After I started taking these I saw a major difference right away I had more energy tolerable periods which decreased over time more control over my appetite and after stopping my periods and behavior went back to normal right away no drastic changes The only downside for me was that from time to time I will be nauseous and I did get breast tenderness but overall it was the best one I have tried All Birth control methods and brands have these similar side effects and different women can experience them differently but for me this was definitely a winner
9219,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42874,9,One month I think Im starting a depression so tired hard time working out Stopping it
9220,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42874,7,Awful birth control Caused me clinical anxiety and depression out of the blue and made me feel suicidal Ive tried many pills and never experienced such mental trauma
9221,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42873,6,Ive been on this birth control for a year and I have to say that its very practical for my body I used to get brutal cramps and long periods No matter what type of birth control I had debilitating cramps Lolo has caused my cramps to stop and my period is consistent and lasts days Only downside is I did get some acne but the acne may be just due to something else since Ive dealt with breakouts prior to trying lolo Also my boobs grew a lot which Im happy about This medication is not for everyone if you experience adverse effects stop taking it immediately as it does not agree with every woman
9222,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42870,0,Ive been taking this for about years now when my gyno switched me from Junel I noticed irritability and mood swings when I first started but thought I got over it after a while Short periods and effective However I just stopped taking it last week and I noticed Im assuming after my hormones have started to regulate again that my irritability and anxiety is little to none When taking the pill pretty anything could irritate me and after about a week of being off the pill even I noticed a drastic change in my behavior I feel much more level headed Ive also always had very clear skin but not since I started taking this so hopefully it will go away soon I have also noticed decreased appetite since stopping
9223,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42861,6,Do not use this if you suffer from anxiety This made mine way worse Ive been suffering anxiety depression and bad mood swings since taking this I have had two periods each month with bad cramping
9224,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42858,4,Ive been on this pill for years now I actually like this one so much better than some of the others I took prior to it I have little to no period each month no mood swings overall Im very happy with it
9226,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42856,3,Ive been taking this birth control for about years now and I would say its been good for me The only negative thing I noticed is increased appetite and a decrease in sex drive I do think my boobs got bigger from it and I have some mild acne but who knows if its from the pill or not
9227,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42855,4,I have a tubal so I am taking this to supposedly to help with night sweats It is Day and my breasts are completely tender I have acne on my face chest neck and back I usually get a few blemishes when I have my period but nothing like this since I was pregnant years ago I am retaining water my ankles are swollen and I am gaining weight I have Been nauseous and my regular bowel movements have become irregular My stomach has some cramping as well I have been trying to figure out how long to take this before the side effects are supposed to go away I am thinking that I will take it until my first period and then dismiss it It is not worth all these extra side effects
9229,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42853,1,So after a bad reaction to Blisovi my doctor tried LoLo for me Turns out its basically the same as Blisovi in terms of active ingredients The first week on this I started getting small white bumps above my lips and my lips became very dry Then I got a rash all over my stomach and on my legs It turns out Im allergic to one of the main ingredients in this pill norethindrone Im only adding this information because if you have similar experiences with Blisovi or LoLo check out the similarities in terms of active ingredients Its worth checking out drugs that dont contain norethindrone if your experience is similar to mine such as Yaz or a Yaz generic Loryna Gianvi Rash is almost gone since I switched to Loryna
9230,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42851,3,Long before I took this I was really moody I did not like to be around anyone but now since I am taking this I am calm and I dont eat as much as I used to but the thing is I am not able to focus in school and I am failing most of my classes and its really weird but I like the pill its a whole lot better than the other birth control pills and patches that I have taken
9231,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42851,10,I do not recommend this birth control Ive been taking it for almost weeks and my body feels completely different This pill made me very nauseous bloated moody and tired It also made my periods closer together and my cramps more painful Definitely going off of it
9232,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42851,1,Took this almost yrs ago after my rd laporoscopy due to endometriosis It was AMAZING Didnt have a single side effect from it Took away all my cramps The only reason I stopped taking it before was my insurance no longer covered it and I could not afford the copay Started taking it again a little over a month ago Now my breasts are HUGE and are always tender And Ive been getting cramps up to weeks ahead of my period Even with the endometriosis cramps dont usually come til a few days before my period The only saving grace was that my period was only days long Im gonna try to continue taking them I love that my period was only days long but this time around out didnt help with my cramps at all
9233,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42846,3,My experience with Lo Loestrin has been great except for one thing acneI had never before have any skin issues not even in my teenage years But now I have a lot of bumps and acne specially on my chin and back Nothing seems to work to eliminate this problemHowever I love the fact that I do not have menstrual periods at all Therefore no cramps headaches nor bloating I actually do not notice any mood changes either Ive been taking it for months now and I am overall happy with itBut I have to say that I am pretty embarrassed and frustrated about my acneI am planning on seeing a dermatologist and see if it helps
9235,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42843,6,Bigger boobs clear skin no emotional disruption no ill side effects that Ive noticed whatsoever Absolutely a godsend
9236,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42838,7,I was prescribed Lo Loestrin Fe to regulate my hormones after surgery I experienced the scary side effects like pain numbness in arms and legs darkening of urine abdominal pain and forgetfulness Not to mention the spotting weight gain acne and contact lens problem I dont use the word hate often but I HATE this pill
9237,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42837,5,Ive been prescribed this birth control since my week checkup February th but I didnt start taking pills until March th After sexual intercourse but I wasnt taking them everyday like I should My period still came on a couple days early and was regular but I have cramps even after my period A couple of days ago April th I started taking the pills everyday and the cramping are starting to decrease but I have headaches and My stomach bubbled up like I had diarrhea amp I felt nauseous at one point
9238,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42836,6,I have been taking this BC for years now and have had a very good experience My periods are pretty much gone and when I do have them they are very short and light I have no gained any weight from this BC or noticed anything off mentally however I do feel very tired a lot but Im not sure this is due to the BC The only thing that I would say is my breast are tender all the time which doesnt really bother me
9240,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42833,10,Ive been taking this for a few months now No bad side effects just a lot of bleeding Ill have my period for a week then boom another one a week and a half later and this one is way heavier and crappier Ive basically bled for almost a month Its ruining my sex life
9241,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42832,5,I am starting my third pack of this pill I am conflicted regarding it because it has reduced my anxiety and levelled my emotions wonderfully but at the cost of having six day periods with only seven days of no period in between the next one Im having two periods a month and Im getting quite annoyed with having to buy tampons constantly The periods are not what I would consider breakthrough bleeding as they are not light and require extra absorbent tampons for the first few daysI believe I have increased hunger and water retention on this pill as well I have gone from a stable lbs to lbsI am so happy with how level and calm I am on itbut fourteen days of bleeding a month is a steep price to pay for it
9242,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42832,3,Im taking this medicine for the past months and I have to say its the worst I feel very very sad I started to get anxious and have meltdowns easily I have no energy to do absolutely anything not even cooking dinner or walk my dogs and I was an active person I tried to stay on the pill because I thought that my body will get used to but Im still having the same side effectsAlso a lot of stomach issues bloating constipation nauseas as well headaches at the right or left side of my head only The only improved side effect I had noticed overtime is that when I started to take this medicine I had a lot of acne and skin inflammation but now I see my skin much betterthis medicine has more cons than pros STAY AWAY
9243,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42832,3,Im and my gyno put me on this to help with my hormone imbalance I have a slightly high testosterone level Im almost months into taking it but within the first week lymph nodes in my face painfully swelled up under my skinThey eventually went down but that was only within a week of taking it later I had acne in places I have NEVER had it and cysts under my skinKeep in mind I have never had a problem with acne in my life of the time prior to this pill my skin was almost completely clearI had irregular bleeding in the middle of the pack after NOT getting it when I was supposed to during the sugar pills I checked the scale yesterday and I gained pounds so far and my mood swings are insane Going off this pill ASAP
9244,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42831,5,I am and have been taking this medication for months I have horrible acne now that I didnt have before on my face and my chest I had a week long period in the first month and havent had one since but I still cramp at times Ive been extremely moody and depressed which isnt going away or decreasing Also I cant lose weight because Im hungry all the time and always feel too miserable to exercise
9246,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42828,3,Ive only been on this pill for a week All I have to say is I dont like it This is my first birth control It gives me extreme headaches The headaches are all day too Not just for a few hours I have migraines anyway but this is just pushing it over Im hungry a lot and just mellow Ive gained lbs already I cry and dont feel good enough to do anything I get super tired I feel like my stomach is messed up all the time It gurgles and cramps Right under my left rib is the main part it hurts Its like I have gas but cant ever burp or fart And when I do it doesnt help anything I really dont like what its dong to me And it being my first BC it really throws the others under the bus
9247,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42822,5,I am years old and Ive been on this birth control for almost months At first I would get the typical spotting through the pill package and I had horrible breakouts around my chin I never got breakout maybe pimples before my period I waited it out for the months because my friends encouraged it They were right for the most part My acne did clear up and now my skin is just as clear as before if not better Yet I get breakthrough bleedingSTILL It scares me more than anything and for that I cant give this birth control a high rating Isnt the birth control suppose to assure you that you are not pregnant This birth control causes more stress than it does help
9249,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42817,3,I really like lolo I was prescribed because of my low tolerance for side effects I have been on for almost or months now and have experienced little to no side effects I was freaked out in the beginning because I had one super long heavy period after the first month of taking it and no period for months afterwards By reading the reviews I found some relief from my anxiety of being pregnant I am giving it an just because I have recently been experiencing night sweats but it could be just because I got my prescription filled at a new pharmacy Otherwise I havent experienced very many side effects as of RECENT In the beginning I expected the side effects Also giving a because it can be expensive if you dont have insurance
9250,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,9,40060,40,I have tried really almost every corticosteroid medication on the market including topical triamcinolone and oral prednisone However this product is by far the most effective because it immediately reduces the swelling and inflammations caused by my skin disorder and disinfects the affected area It also doesnt cause the weight gain and mood swings of prednisone so its considerably safer and milderThe only unfortunate parts of this medication are that it can be quite greasy causing mild discomfort and can cause stinging when applied especially if the wound is new I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with their dermatological problem
9253,Clobetasol,Lichen Sclerosus,10,39991,15,My obstetriciangynecologist cured the vaginal lichen sclerosis by surgically using extra skin Still I have to use the ointment x a week on the anal skin to keep the area from pain itching and bleeding On other days since it is not recommended to use too often I use raw shea butter with emphasis on quotrawquot
9255,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,39906,16,This has worked inside my ears very well Its not been effective for me on my scalp or back but works great for my ears
9256,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,39895,16,I was prescribed OluxE for Psorisis of the scalp I made an appointment with a dermatologist because I was embarrassed by the flakes and condition of my scalp Symptoms were cut in half after two days of use and gone in four I can wear black again It still itches a bit but the flakes are gone Couldnt be happier It is a topical steroid so Im going to stop using and keep some on hand for the occasional flare upSo impressed THANK YOU
9257,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,6,39891,116,I have had moderate and sometimes severe plaque and guttate psoriasis for years using clobetasol clobex for Clobex is the only thing that can eliminate my psoriasis almost completely It is a very effective drug but I feel I really should warn people of the devastating effects that can occur if the drug is applied continuously When using clobex or any other strong topical corticosteroid you are supposed to use it for no more than weeks then take a break I believe should be between and weeks I made the mistake of not doing that I used it continuously because I wanted to be clear Now my skin is paper thin Nearly every vein is visible and I break blood vessels constantly and I have stretch marks everywhere
9259,Clobetasol,Lichen Sclerosus,10,39884,20,Finally relief Just wish that I could use it everyday I have noticed though that even on my days off each month the itching is less than before
9260,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,39808,12,The only really effective remedy for my scalp psoriasis I used Scalpicin but it turned my white hair yellowish and I had to keep using it almost every day Olux for three days and my scalp is clear and not itchy for weeks
9261,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,39727,4,Great stuff Much better than taking prednisone
9263,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,39696,24,I was prescribed Clobetasol Propionate for severe poison ivy rash and this ointment stopped the itch and cleared the rash within a matter of days I now keep a tube on hand all summer long
9264,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,9,39692,15,Clobetasol Propionate topical solution USP manufactured by TARO I have occasional dermatitis of the scalp this clears it right up with only an application or two An average of maybe applications per month
9266,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,8,39604,14,I have been using clobetasol for about years It works straight away if I get any psoriasis on my face
9267,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,39567,18,After a very bad breakout from a strep infection this was the only thing that stopped the itch After using this twice a day for a week along with UV treatments I started seeing my psoriasis clear up And the spray is so much easier to apply
9268,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,39538,12,Awesome product According to my dermalogist I had a severe case of psoriasis on the hands feet knees and elbows a total of of my body area All cleared up except the front of the feet within weeks so down to in weeks The doctor had explained that it would take longer on the feet and Im ok with it I love the results the price however is another story I dont have insurance and one bottle of the spray is help
9270,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,39526,33,AMAZINGWithin days I could see a difference in my skinThe plaques were starting to fadethe redness and itchiness GONEIt has been exactly one week since I started using the spray and I no longer have psoriasis
9274,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,9,40997,30,Clobex is the only thing that worked Severe patches and redness went away in only days Its expensive and is a very strong medicine a little goes a long way
9275,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,40953,16,I have localized scleroderma Morphea I have patches all over my back very painful swollen itchy looks redpurplelish cant stand anything touching my skin My doctor prescribed clobetasol x day He said that the patches in my back were so swollen that I would not notice any changes for at least a month Well Ive only used Clobetasol for weeks and I can see a big diference my skin doesnt hurt itch its not swollen it does not look irritated it even looks healthy
9278,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,40803,11,Incredible medication I have no negative comments I recommend this cream
9279,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,40798,29,My dermatologist prescribed temovate Clobetason for me to use with rash caused by poison ivy I get poison ivy frequently and this is the only remedy I have ever found that really works You can see the results overnight The rash is completely gone usually in a week or less
9280,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,40798,12,My doctor prescribed Temovate Clobetasol for rash and itch caused from poison ivy exposure I got very quick results The morning after applying this cream the symptoms began to decrease In a day or two it was completely gone
9283,Clobetasol,Not Listed / Othe,10,40696,3,We have used this for poison ivy Its great Stops the itch and the spread
9284,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,40654,11,Ive had psoriasis since I was It has gotten worse and worse over the years and Ive used clobetasol since the start Im now Ive always thought my veins popping out was a normal thing but Im starting to think maybe my skin is thin Clobetasol is the only medication thats ever worked Ive tried so many things itd take me forever to name them all
9285,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,40618,10,Olux has been the only topical medication Ive used that has been able to control the psoriasis on my scalp Over the past few years my condition has significantly worsened However since beginning to use DermaSmoothe and Olux I have been able to maintain a very healthy scalp The DermaSmoothe is fantastic for removing the initial buildup from psoriasis while the Olux is a great for preventing its return I only have to use Olux about once every weeks or at the first sign of any symptoms Only downside is the high cost since we have a high insurance deductible However I personally find it to be worth the money
9286,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,3,40463,43,I used Clobex this summer for itching and dry flakes in my scalp I became sick with a bad cold and later turned to pneumonia I was sick all summer long with trouble breathing and wheezing I went to an ENT and a lung doctor None of us could figure out what was causing the lung problem After several months I was getting better with the breathing problems Last week I used Clobex again because the itching scalp came back Two days later I am having breathing problems I put and together read the side effects of Clobex and breathing problems and wheezing are the first side effects listed All that suffering because I did not read the medical bulletins earlier
9287,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,5,40448,25,I got this psoriasis when I was in my early s and I thought it was nothing because it started in my head Itching and redness followed but still I ignored it not until it got bigger then I went to my doctor to get checked up First he doesnt know what kind of condition I have He gave me a lot of things that made no effects on my skin Bottom line was he didnt made me feel better until I discovered Clobex I used the shampoo and spray in the same time but you need to be aware that over time any medications will not work You need to take a break otherwise you will be immune to it or even worse My skin cleared but after few months it came back so be careful using any medications
9289,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,8,40372,7,Ive always had dermatitis on my scalp and face but the rashes on my body started out as allergic dermatitis after it reacted to an antibiotic called Vancomycin But then even after all my antibiotics the rashes kept getting worse and worse I got a biopsy done and the results were that I had psoriasis form of dermatitis which is similar to psoriasis At first the dermatologist prescribed Clobex but it only worked on my arms I still use the Clobex shampoo for my scalp After that the dermatologist told me to try Olux Ive been using Olux for a couple of weeks now and my body is clearing up especially my back and thighs
9291,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,10,40175,22,This medication calmed down the inflamation in psoriasis I was so pleased with the results After about two weeks of twice daily use my skin appeared to be getting back to normal however I will be starting on Stelara because Humira was ineffective I can see that all the psoriasis medications are individualized to each person
9292,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10,40149,15,Works exceptionally well on body and scalp The only problem is it is outrageously expensive I had to go with the generic form
9293,Clobetasol,Lichen Sclerosus,5,40139,9,I have used it for three years was helping me some for awhile but now it seems to irritate me more
9296,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10,40093,23,Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis I was prescribed Clobex lotion for my condition that arises occasionally and causes itching and burning mostly on my arms Whenever I get a flareup I apply Clobex and get immediate relief
9297,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,5,40077,39,I have had psoriasis for years and have treated it with cortisone to control the inflammations and itching I discovered Clobex about a year ago and used it on my elbows and scalp It does a great job in eliminating the external signs of psoriasis when used for to weeks However after about a month the symptoms return I have used it a second and third time with the same results but I am hesitant to continue this process considering the warnings provided
9300,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42738,6,Been on Lo Loestrin for two years Birth Control and help with my fibroidsheavy periods The first months lighter periodscramps Had a month check up after this was due to complications from pregnancy fibroids were extremely large I was not able to carry to term Outcome after being on Lo fibroid growth decreased no more bloating or abdomen pressure The downside irregular periods brown discharge and mild cramps when not on cycle Once my sex life resumed after months of being celibate I realized my sex drive was completely gone No desire after multiple tries I stayed dry and I had no arousal whatsoever Using condoms made it worse My decision now get off Lo my fibroids minimal and I want to feel like a woman again
9301,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42738,5,In the first few months that I was on this drug I had a a few side effects I had some spotting between periods not much but some The real issues was that I was ridiculously fatigued all the time I constantly wanted to sleep and every nap I took would last hours The spotting went away after a month or two and the fatigue went away after about months The only side effect I have now is a lowered sex drive I used to get very heavy periods that lasted full days with bad cramps almost every day The very first period I had on this drug was already shortened by a day or two and now almost a year later I barely even bleed anymore I could do without the lowered sex drive but as a whole I have no complaints about my experience
9302,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42737,4,Been on this pill for over two years now I originally went on to control heavy periods acne and immobilizing cramps The first three months I didnt get a period at all even with taking the sugar pills This scared me but my doctor told me its perfectly healthy and I have since stopped taking the sugar pills all together Ive always struggled with my weight but I didnt have more than maybe a few pounds weight gain when I started taking it Ive recently become sexually active and think that the pill might be slightly interfering with my sex drive seeing as its not very high but dont know that as a fact Overall Im very happy with all this pill and plan to continue taking it
9303,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42737,5,I started taking lolo when I was due to acne and a cyst I had and I had the worst experience longer periods bloating and increased acne and nasty brown discharge with cramps more painful than any cramps Ive ever felt So I quit taking it then a few years later I started having sex and decided to get back on and my gyno gave me the same birth control even tho I told her how it affected my body but she insisted I am currently having the same side effects and periods a month and so much pain anxiety and mood swings and dryness during sex I do not recommend this birthcontrol I would give it a
9304,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42735,11,Im and sexually active and I love this pill Ive been on it for about a month and the only issue is that I have bad cramps but not as bad as what I used to have before this bc Im pounds and this pill works wonders for me No issues here at all Dont let all these scary reviews scare you Try it for yourself and see if it works Every body reacts to medicine differently
9305,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42734,2,I have had no problems with this birth control non whtsoever My doctor prescribed it for birth control heavy periods and cystic acne It has worked out perfectly for all of my conditions The acne disappeared within the first month of use and I have not have a period by choice since I started using it months ago My insurance covers all the cost It is just perfect The sad part is that I need to begin a new regiment of anti seizure medications and this birth control interacts with it so I will have to stop taking it It is really a bummer but hey you got to pick your battles
9311,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42724,6,I started off on Microgestin Fe and I was fine dealing with side effects such as minor anxiety headaches bloating mood swings increased appetite mind fog assuming it would go away and it was normal until week Then it got so bad I couldnt handle it or wait it out anymore I had a panic attack and anxiety so bad I immediately quit Right after I was fine My body went back to normal Then I started Lo Loestrin Fe and I STILL feel normal No bloating no anxiety no mood swings My boobs did get bigger and I have a bit more energy than normal I was worried all birth control would make me feel as the first one did but with doing research I found the perfect one for me
9313,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42718,1,This was the first pill I was prescribed I never became pregnant although towards the end I felt symptoms monthly After a year my periods became irregular My sex drive decreased severely and I became dried up My acne never changed I gained weight but I wont say it was cause of the pill
9314,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42717,4,My gyno recommended this pill bc of its low estrogen I have VERY heavy periods and a fibroid My symptoms every month are insane and I cant even imagine why she thought this garbage would help Apparently she hasnt read one freaken review on it I started the pill on the last day of my period then two weeks later I started my period again Its been days straight and on the th day the flood gates opened and I am now using a new super tampon every minutes This is what I was trying to get away from I have bled more on this pill than I did without I am stopping immediately This pill is crap avoid at all costs
9315,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42716,4,I have been on lo loestrin fe for about months now and I have not had the greatest experience with it First off I was getting periods a month one being in the middle of the second week and the other during the week I was supposed to and both periods were extremely painful and heavy I told my doctors of my troubles and she ensured me that it would probably get better and to give it a couple more months before switching It has gotten a little bit better but I ended up having to switch anyways because my insurance doesnt cover this medication since it is not generic Other than the periods a month I did not gain weight or breakout but it did take me forever to adjust so good luck to anyone who goes on this pill
9317,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42713,5,I was on generess before this which was a mint chewable Very strange I had zero side effects from that EXCEPT the dosage was so strong I had these sharp shooting pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack So I switched to lo loestrin I dont get my period anymore AT ALL No spotting nothing No more shooting pains My only complaint is that Ive noticed a serious decline in sex drive If they could somehow fix that this would get stars
9318,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42711,7,Overall I have had a pretty good kindoff mixed experience with Lo Loestrin The side effects werent too extreme Like others said Ive had random spotting here and there that gets annoying I have definitely noticed breast tenderness and swelling Ive always had bigger breasts lost some weight last year and was finally down to a smaller cup only to now be back to a somewhat bigger size Ive been a little more on the emotional side but nothing overly noticeable or crazy Havent lost my sex drive but sometimes experience vaginal dryness which had never been a problem in the past The biggest pro is a SUPER light period which is amazing and the reason Ive stayed on it Dont let bad reviews scare you away try it out for yourself
9319,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42711,1,If I could give this medicine a I would It made me breakout when my skin had been close perfect it caused me to be sick and have bowel problems It made my pcos worse I had mood swings and it killed my sex drive A weird thing was it made my taste buds swell too that was the worst thing
9320,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42710,6,I hate this birth control I start spotting a week into my period every month on it months now and have to wear a liner at all times Horrible mood swings no sex drive the dark brown spotting all month doesnt help and is barely covered by birth control Still would have had to pay out of pocket each month if I wanted to continue on it which I dont Will be switching back to Ocella as soon as I can which didnt have any of these side effects I got a month sample of Lo Loestrin Fe and will be throwing out the remaining months
9321,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42710,4,My old gyno recommended this pill so I took it I was on this pill for four months and took it religiously I became pregnant If I could give this pill then I would
9323,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42707,9,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PILL I was on orthotricylcin lo I liked it a lot because I had zero acne The only problem was that my periods lasted over a week amp could be painful I changed gynocologist when I moved to college She put me on Lo Loestrin Fe amp it was the worst year of my entire life My face look worse than it did in th grade I have ZERO sex drive I already have anxiety amp this pill made it a million times worse amp I about drove everyone as well as myself crazy with my mood swings amp attitude Wanna know the worst part I had two periods a month One on the week my actual period was supposed to start amp one on be second week in the pack I put up with that for an entire year thinking it would quotregulatequot It didnt BEWARE
9325,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42769,2,Im writing this at am when I should be sleep because Im on the last day of the pill and spotting has gotten worse Im in my mid s and have been on this pill for about months it works well I spot a little but typically havent had a full cycle I do have mood swings and lately some really bad cramping But overall the pill works well also I have notice I swear a lot more than ever in my life and I do get acne more often Hope this helps
9326,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42769,4,I thought that lo lo would be a good choice of birthcontrol for me but I regret taking it I had really bad migraines nausea leg cramps stomach pains painful acne and even though my boobs got bigger they were sore for weeks almost Last issue I had with this BC was sex drive I think that some people would consider this a good thing but not for me it increased my sex drive and for me I dont need it right now so it was not a bonus lol Period cramping also got worse for me
9327,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42767,12,Either Im really a psycho or it just so happens Im all the sudden super emotional since I started taking this about weeks ago Is anyone else experiencing this Ive also been breaking out really bad
9328,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42767,4,This pill is great for me Ive tried the shot nuva ring ortho tricyclen seasonique so many birth controls and each one caused spotting or bleeding every single day over about years unless I was not on a pill I also still had extremely heavy periods with them On this pill I spotted for about the first days then nothing My period was the lightest its been since high school Lighter than high school so Im very happy to finally find a pill that works I was just about to give up
9329,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42763,1,This is my first ever pill I used The first couple months were full of nausea headaches sadness and anxiety Around months in Ive been bleeding for days during the second week Then spotting for days during my last week This happened for a few months At first I thought it was still adjusting but now its a continuous cycle With the super low estrogen theres been a lack of lubrication during intercourse Ill be having burning sensations lasting for a max hrsOverall it was a bad and good pill It was bad to have the lack of lubrication and the continuous bleeding every two weeks It was good to have cleared my acne for the most part and to have intercourse without a condom
9332,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42759,4,DO NOT TAKE THIS BIRTH CONTROL My gosh this is the worst thing to ever happen to me Having clear skin my entire life I had never dealt with such harsh breakouts in my life I looked like a year old going through puberty Also not to mention I was in such severe lower abdominal and lower back pain I could hardly move I would not recommend this pill whatsoever Super moody as well
9333,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42759,6,I have taken every birth control know to man and this one was the only one I could tolerate for nausea and upset stomach Although after being on it for several months I have re occurring consistent UTIs at least one every two months Acne on my back I have NEVER had acne horrible mood swings significant hair loss lack of energy headaches suicide thoughts and horrible anxiety I was so conflicted and second guessed my side effects with this pill after getting off of it all of those symptoms were gone Ladies its NOT worth it
9334,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42758,5,Ive been on this pill for almost two years months It was originally prescribed to me to clear up my acne and I love it I have shorter periods and so far its been good with pregnancy prevention My only problem is that Ive missed two periods one April and one November and I have had some scares but hey not pregnant Never had any weird side effects
9335,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42754,6,An overall good BC pill It has helped tremendously with facial acne I have also noticed an increase in scalp hair growth while on this pill The only side effects I have experienced are low libido and absence of a cycle which may be a plus for some users Due to the aforementioned cycle absence I have stopped taking this pill for a few months at time to induce a monthly menstrual cycle I think the pros of this pill definitely outweigh the cons Good pill to try if you are having problems with heavy cycles andor acne
9337,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42752,1,I have been taking this BC for months now because I was becoming sexually active again and this pills completely kills that I have absolutely no sex drive to the point where even thinking about sex stresses me out Ive gained pounds I am always always tired I am overly emotional and can cry over anything Constant headaches and the nauseous is unbearable I didnt really know why I was feeling all of these things because it took about months to notice but these other reviews helped me connect the dots to the pills causing me so much trouble Everyone reacts differently but I dont recommend risking it
9340,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42748,7,Lo loestrin fe was the first and will be the only birth control pill that I tried The first week and a half was complexity fine and I was really happy that I wasnt experiencing any negative side effects Then midway through the second week of the pack I started bleeding At first I wasnt concerned because I knew that breakthrough bleeding was common and I figured in a few days it would disappear However the bleeding was extremely heavy and clumpy which is definitely not typical for me In addition my cramping was constant and EXTREMELY painful making it difficult for me to participate in everyday activities Not to mention that I have now been bleeding for going on days with no end in sight I am so disappointed with this pill
9341,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42747,3,Ive been on this birth control pill for almost a year now and its been pretty decent Ive had very few side effects and the best thing about it is that I dont get my period However my libido has decreased and Ive started experiencing mood swings which is not at all normal for me So Im planning on switching pills to alleviate those side effects hopefully
9342,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42747,1,I have been on this birth control since I was and I am now I began this bc because my periods were so bad For about or years I would have regular monthly periods only about days The last year or so I do not bleed anymore but feel the symptoms of a period I guess this is a good thing no period but Im in a serious relationship and sexually active and this keeps me on my toes When I got put on this pill I gained pounds Not really a complaint it was needed weight However in the last year or so I have noticed a change in my behavior and sex drive Im worried this bc has something to do with it But overall it has worked for me I have some anxiety and depression sometimes but what woman doesnt Cant really blame it
9344,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42746,3,I have been on this pill for a little over months and I thought it was great at first but after a week on it I started feeling nauseous everyday and so tired I also get random headaches and I thought it was from a cold but now Im sure its the pill I will be switching as soon as possible
9345,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42742,1,I started this just to see if it would help with my period and the cramps I had My face first started by breaking out really bad everywhere I also felt bloated the whole month I took it I stopped when I started my period and the cramps were worse than they have ever been before It was horrible I wouldnt recommend it to any year old
9346,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42742,5,I have been on Lo Loestrin Fe for one month exactly So far I love it I started my first pill on the first day of my period and no problems I bleed about days after my period was supposed to stop but I guess that is normal Other than that it is perfect
9348,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42739,7,I started this pill on the first day of my period and have almost finished a pack now I had a longer period followed by brown discharge for a week This pill makes me feel fatigued the whole time just like the worst I feel before getting my period My energy level has decreased significantly Secondly I noticed my sex drive is gone Last but not the least my hair is falling a lot Initially I was going to give it another month to see if the side effects will get better but now I decide to get off this pill after the first pack It changed how my body feels completely and I cant be this tired everyday
9350,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42576,8,I started LoLo about one month ago I switched from Nuvaring to the pill Everyone is different but for reference Im quot Im pretty healthy and wanted to see how this would work and now Ive had nausea for about weeks low sex drive low appetite My skin and weight have not changed at all Called my doc and she said my body is getting used to the meds Hoping this ends soon because its no fun
9352,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42571,3,Ive been on Lo Loestrin Fe for a year now and Ive been relatively happy Im and not sexually active but my doctor prescribed me the pill to help with my PCOS Since I wasnt looking for it for birth control purposes I was mainly focusing on acne the duration and pain of my periods and weight changes I experienced absolutely no weight change and my periods almost and when I did get my period they were painful but they were so infrequent so it wasnt a concern I noticed also that my acne got worse Fortunately I have not experienced any mood changes appetite changes migraines etc Overall I think as a first time birth control user its been an ok experience but if youre looking for acne solutions maybe try something else
9354,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42570,12,Im weeks into Lolo after Mirena IUD removal and due to irregular periods and ovarian cysts Not sure whats a mirena removal sideeffect Mirena crash vs lolo side effect But Ive had headaches and anxiety and really sad sad days Just blah Im going to update as time goes on to annotate any other proscons I have been nauseas the past few days too
9356,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42567,3,Ive been taking this for two years now and I love it I work crazy shifts at work that dont allow me to wake up and go to sleep at the same time EVER so when I end up taking it hours late I dont have to worry about it not being as effective Also apparently if you completely miss a dose its okay too I have yet to try this out but It seems awesome in theory The only real side effect it has caused me is completely losing my sexdrive I only have one the two days of the Iron pills But as I get older I find thats not really all that important to me anymore anyways I do take sleep aids everynight to combat the sleep loss however I am not sure if its the medicine that causes this or just other mental disorders I have
9357,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42566,5,Im almost done with my first pack of Lo Loestrin Fe and I am pretty happy with it I had minor spotting the second week and light spotting during the two white pills so far The only side effects Ive noticed so far are changes in appetite first two weeks I was super hungry and then the third week I hardly ate at all I had some nausea along with the changes in appetite but nothing too major I have a history with anxiety and the pill has slightly elevated it but it is manageable Id say anyone who is sensitive to high doses of estrogen should definitely try Lo Loestrin Fe
9358,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42563,5,I have been on lolo estro for months Prior to this pill I was on gianvi which is the generic of Yaz I had to switch because after years with gianvi I started to experience vaginal dryness and low libido Lo lo estro has been good no negative side effects like I had with gianvi I havent had a period in the time Ive been taking it which was worrisome at first but I guess its normal No weight gain or change in appetite As far as skinacne no trouble there Give it a try
9361,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42558,12,I have been on Lolo for just over a year now after I finished breastfeeding my son and have had no negative side effects The pill has not caused any weight gain or losses change in attitude or sex drive I havent had a period in about months now and it is slightly alarming that the pill is changing my cycle so much but as long as I can still have more children when I am ready and my period comes back once I go off of Lolo I consider this to be an excellent birth control pill
9362,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42557,30,Like most of you probably are doing I took it upon myself to look up some reviews as to how women feltrespondedlikeddisliked LoLo STOP RIGHT THERE I read nightmarish reviews after I took my first pill and was paranoid Id experience some of the quotsymptomsquot and quotside effectsquot others did The day after my first pill I felt sleepy and my body felt weak aside from that NOTHING My transition was seamless Granted everyones different but after feeling no difference I began to think maybe the things said here were all in their heads I have absolutely no complaints about LoLo My sex drive hasnt been affected in the slightest Im very VERY big on taking care of my face and skin and I havent had any acne pimples etc Go for it
9363,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42555,10,I have been on just about every pillneedle contraceptive out there and usually all the side affects take about a year to show up I was on depo needle for years and LOVED it but my doctor made a point of mentioning every months that I should go off of it Now thislovely little pill destroyed my sex drive within the first months only positive is that I grew a cup size over night Downfall gained pounds over months Constant bloating and took months for my period to regulate Another bad side affect is I no longer sleep longer than hours a night when I am known for sleeping like a log and night sweats are so bad I wake up soaking to the point I have to change my clothes and sheetsnever had that before in my life
9364,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42554,5,Im taking this medication to regulate my period I was scared after reading the side effects especially about the hair loss and the weight gain but I know everyone is different This is my nd month and Ive experienced loss of appetite stomach ache nauseavomitting the mostIve actually lost pounds which is awesome The neaseavomitting is only about once a week so its not that badI just am not hungry anymorewhich helps me make better choices in eating My first month I was hormonal however now I think my bodies gotten use to it so Im not as hormonal As far as my periodIt hasnt been long enough to tell if its regulated
9367,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42549,14,Ive been on this birth control for almost a year and a half I have probably tried different brands over the last years and this is by far the best No side effects for me at all and the best part I havent had a period the entire time Ive been on it Ill spot very lightly for days out of the month and thats it I recommend it to everyone I know
9368,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42548,10,Ive been on the pill for about a year and month now This is my first birth control and I got on it because my periods were horrible and extremely heavy and also because I entered a serious relationship I was fine up until the half year mark until I had spotting for days before getting my real period days late Now I still have breakthrough bleeding right after ovulation which always causes me to freak out Other than that the pill is fine I actually lost weight on this pill and I cant gain weight anything past My sex drive is sometimes affected it takes a while for me to get into the mood and my boyfriend is supportive of it Its just the darn spotting that irritates me
9369,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42544,3,I was prescribed Lo Loestrin by my ob to reset my ovaries since my hormones are all over the place and my period were very long cycle and irregular She recommend me to take it for two months I finished taking my first pack and I didnt get any severe side effects just breast feeling tender and swollen I also got spotting during my third weeks of taking it And I didnt get any withdraw bleeding during my two placebo pills Hoping Loestrin would regulate my hormones after I finish taking it for two months so I can try conceiving again
9370,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42544,5,I came off of Yasmin due to the blood clot risks Lolo is the third brand I have tried and is by far the best I commonly get headaches and it has been reduced after changing to this brand There have been no negative side effects I dont get any cramps or periods at all I may get spotting every couple months for days but thats it I would recommend this brand to anyone if they can afford it as it is not covered by all insurance and is slightly expensive
9371,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42542,10,I have been using this pill for months and during this time I gained over lbs and my anxiety and paranoia has caused irreparable damage to my relationship I must note I work out and have no changes in lifestyle that shouldve caused me to gain weight I am constantly sad on the verge of tears I am oversensitive and negative I am just not myself I gave the pill more than the month trial period because I dont want to keep switching hormones but I cannot keep this up any longer I am going to try the nuva ring For the record I was previously on Diane very happily for years with no side effects but my doctor took me off because it is apparently too high in hormones
9372,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42541,6,I am and have been on this BC for months now I took another brand with higher does before but it caused a lot of negative side effects including fainting night blood pressure and nausea My doctor recommended Lolo for managing my PCOS and it has been great First pack was like an adjusting period where cycle was irregular disgusting discharge etc Periods now come regularly No weight gain or loss Blood pressure remains the same Because it has lowest does among all other brands I have to take it everyday and at the same time or I will have light bleeding like one drop the next day Why go with a higher does when you can achieve the same effect with lower
9373,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42540,12,The medication was prescribed to help with very heavy unpredictable long periods associated with my being in perimenopause First couple months virtually no period to speak of but days of midcycle breakthrough bleedingnot spotting Enough to feel like a light period By third month no breakthrough bleeding or even a period This has been a huge relief for me Seems to have helped alleviate some mood swings and irritability also For users unhappy with this pill in the first few months I would encourage you to give it a bit of time I was not thrilled with it at first but am very happy with it now My Insurance doesnt cover it bummer but the drug company offers a discount card which I received from my nurse practitioner
9375,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42705,9,I took this pill for and a half years for my heavy periods I recently switched because my new insurance wont cover this one The first month I experienced little to no side effects but month two was horrible I had severe headaches dizziness constant spotting etc but I waited it out The symptoms all went away by the rd month From then until I got off it it was wonderful It made my periods really light and only lasted around days I used to have horrible cramps and nausea but on this pill I had no nausea and the cramps were very little I almost never had to take medicine for the pain I did experience some weight gain though lbs in years but I also didnt eat too healthily so Im also to blame Altogether Good experience
9380,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42694,4,I had a positive experience with Lo Loesterin Fe I had spotting within the first couple months but besides that no complaints However I didnt get my period as often as I used to
9381,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42691,8,I have been on Lolo for over years now I must say the beginning was awful I was told to stick it out months which most birth controls you should try to do so I spotted and got my period multiple times within the first months way more than normal After months it has been golden ever since No periods no scares no concerns I have had absolutely no problems I love this birth control I feel great on it and havent gained any weight or got acne from it If you are considering this birth control dont give up after a few weeks stick it out for a few months and then decide My friends have had the same experience and they love it and have been on other kinds but would never switch back
9382,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42685,6,I just want to know why this type of bc does not come in a generic form It is gt a month without insurance many insurance companies will not cover brand name medications and the prescribing company Allergan does not offer a generic form This would make it significantly cheaper As an RN I understand the health implications of estrogenhormone therapy ie blood clots cancer emotional instability weight gain etc This is truly the lowest form of bc out there mcg micrograms Most bc is prescribed in miligrams mg mcg Its like the prescribing companies want women to be at risk Sorry rant overIn terms of side effects and overall satisfaction I am happy other than the price tag
9385,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42679,6,I was on this for a year before having to switch due to switching insurance and the out of pocket cost When I first started this medication I did have pretty serious nausea that cleared up within two weeks after my body was able to adjust from the switch After that I never noticed any other side effects I did take this in combination with Topamax so weight gain was not an issue for me like others mentioned I also took this in a continuous method in order to prevent mood swings and this worked extremely well for me So that being said I cannot attest to how it affected my periods other than I did not have any spotting etc It worked extremely well for me and I did not experience any depression or any other negative side effects
9388,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42674,4,Side effects for the first few months Two unusually heavy periods and stretch marks on breasts After that though everything settled down to where now I dont even have periods Ive told my doctor and they said that was normal and fine Ive taken it for about three years now and havent had any issues The price tag is a bit much but I find it worth it
9390,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42670,6,Ive been on this for five months Dont just dont If you have any history of depression on BC run fast and far Im bloated I hate everyone Im tired no matter how much sleep I get my acne is terrible and my mind is muddled I wish I could just find a pill that doesnt make me so depressedI definitely was not like this before I used to be kind to most and happy to be aliveNow I wish everyone would leave me alone But hey Im not pregnant
9391,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42669,5,I went on this BC because I do not get regular periods usually just random light spotting I wanted something to regulate it I started it and days later got the worst period Ive ever experienced Lasted days I stopped the pill after days with heavy bleeding and severe abdominal cramps very clotty Lost my appetite and got acne in places Ive never had it before like my back and chest After that period ended I decided to give it another try Exact same experience as the first time as well as nausea vomiting dizziness lightheaded and constipation Stopping it immediately and going back to my doctor
9392,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42669,7,I started this pill after my son was born he is two and a half I had lost all my baby weight and then gaind pounds on this Also I had some Depression start and I wasnt sure if it was from my dad passing away But then I got severe mood swings and emotional states so bad it was giving me chest painsSo I stopped the pill and anything else vitamin wise I was taking for about months When I wanted to be back on birth control my new doctor put me on this again Well Im months in the depression and severe mood swings are all back WORSE than beforeso Im going with that it is the pill to the point where my husband wants me to immediately stop taking it he believes its the pill as well because its not like me to be like this
9394,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42663,2,Ive been on this bc for months The first months were okay a few more pimples than normal but no big deal Ive gained almost lbs the th month The periods are light but I have breakthrough bleeding in the middle of the pack and its always old blood like my flow is too light The worst thing for me is the cystic acne this pill has caused me My face breaks out in red bumps that hurt big hard cysts that Never seem to go away and Im in a constant state of break out It has caused cysts on my breasts underarms and stomache Granted I have pcos and had some before this has caused them to multiply everywhere Everything I use just makes it worse Have an appointment next week to switch back to mono linyah
9395,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42662,10,I LOVE THIS BIRTH CONTROLImproved my complexion No weight gainNO SIDE EFFECTSNo periodBEST BIRTH CONTROL IVE EVER USED
9397,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42656,10,I understand that this BC is not for everyone but I have noticed that a lot of the quotbad reviewsquot didnt give this pill a chance for longer than months My doc told me it would take at LEAST months to adjust to the pill and to wait it out about that long to see any side effects subside As far as my experience goes I have had a few very manageable side effectsThe first week or two I gained lbs in water weight had some minor mood swingscrying spells and decreased appetite but that all went away and returned to normal The only thing negative so far for me is that I have had spottingperiod in the middle of each pack which is VERY light as well as cramps for about days straight Hoping that part goes away soon
9398,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42655,3,Overall my experience has been pretty brutal My first month my period came a week early which I thought was normal since my period is usually irregular that period continued on and lasted days with extremely heavy flow and horrible cramps Ive had unbearable breast tenderness throughout my whole experience and my acne has only gotten worse after starting this pill and one of the main reasons for starting it was to clear acne Throughout my whole experience my period has been unpredictable and extremely irregular Without insurance this pill is expensive there are way better pills for your money and for less aswell I regret ever trying this pill
9399,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42653,4,This pill is awful This is the very first birth control pill Ive taken and I thought I would write a review to warn other people not to put this in their body I started the first pack on the first day of my period and my period has not stopped since then It usually lasts about days and is on a very regular day cycle This pill has also made me extremely bloated and tired all the time I recently switched to Mononessa the generic for Ortho Cyclen Im hoping the bleeding will stop since higher dosages normally mean less chances of breakthrough bleeding or spotting Id also like to warn ladies that this pill has a very high androgen index so its likely that you will experience hair loss Cant wait for it to be out of my system
9400,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42653,10,I am and switched from the Nuvaring to this I workout about xs a week and try to eat healthy but on Nuvaring I gained about lbs in mos lbs to lbs I decided to switch because I needed something with low hormone levels I love this BC I quickly stabilized back to normal weight and lost my appetite as well I was a little moody in the beginning but now I am mos in and feel normal with a normal sex drive I had some spotting in a month but that has stopped as well I was advised to take a daily womens vitamin along with a probiotic the combination helps to stabilize hormones This could play a part as to why I feel great too
9401,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42650,6,I had a horrible time with this birth control Originally went on it to get rid of my periods which it did but also managed to screw me over I quickly noticed my hair was thinner and it continued to fall out in huge clumps My doctors told me it had to be my diet and there was no way it was caused by my pill which I had coincidentally started right before I became very depressed to where I would not get out of bed I remember watching buses on the street and wishing one would hit me and kill me My labia became dry and flat and it hurt to touch it I gained weight in weird places and felt horrible about myself As soon as I went off this pill it all went away So trust yourself and get off this pill if you have weird side effects
9404,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42648,6,Why I am taking this mediciine Hormone Regulation Painful Periods Painful Ovulation I do have fibroids but I will consider removing them if they are still a problem after menopause I am years old single mother work full time eat healthy workout to days a week No weight gain or sore breasts I have been reading about on here Pros I think this BC is great Pain is gone periods are lighter I have used the patch and other pills beforeCons I had some slight nausea Take this with food at breakfast or lunch and take it WITHIN a consistent time of day everyday Be sure to drink your water all day and eat healthy wellbalanced mealsDid it work for me Yes I do not have pain anymore periods very light
9406,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42646,4,I have been on Lo Loestrin for about months now Before this one I was on Safryl I switched because Safryl was giving me horrible side effects I like Lo Loestrin however I dont love it because the spotting between periods has not stopped I havent gained weight if anything have lost some My face is clear and my sex drive is okay not like before but i havent lost it In my experience this pill has more positive than negatives I was also diagnosed with PCOS and Hashimotos Disease Birth control pills dont have the same effect on everyone My GYN had me complete a hormone test before prescribing me this pill He wanted to balance my hormones out with the pill and it looks like he did Im hoping the spotting goes away
9407,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42643,5,I have been on the Pill for a month now amp its the worst THE WORST Ladies do not get this Two days in a row Ive jumped up at am with the WORST lower abdominal cramps Ive also been bleeding since the th it is now the th My sister is a nurse amp INSISTED I stopped taking this She said this isnt the first time shes heard bad things about this specific brand Also said girls come into the hospital all the time because of this birth control with major problems My moods have been everywhere My sex drive has disappeared Just dont get this
9408,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42640,0,I hate this birth control I have terrible mood swings insanely increased appetite and Ive gained lbs My skin has also broken out like crazy Tried to let my body get used to it for a few months but the symptoms have only gotten worse I DO NOT recommend I only give it a because I did not get pregnant while on it
9409,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42640,8,I am IN LOVE with this pill It is expensive without insurance but its been worth it for me I havent had a period in almost years now I havent had any issues with temperament weight gain or loss acne etc I have a history of aural migraines so any birth control with estradiol in it is a little more dangerous which is essentially all of them but with this I have noticed a HUGE reduction in headaches and complications with my vision during them
9412,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42630,4,I only been taking this drug for two months When I had my period it was worst than before Didnt get my period the second month My major issue is my ragemood swings I am not the type of person to be angry on the daily Also I started with no ance I would get a pimple here and there The second month I started to see a few It does take more than a couples of months to help the acne I started to take this drug to not get pregnant and for my acne
9413,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42628,2,I had a miscarriage and went to my OBGYN and he prescribed me LoLo He didnt tell me how or when to use it so I tried to read up on it before I did My MC started on august and I got my ultrasound to check up on everything and they said I passed the baby so I started LoLo I bled for a month but towards the end of the month last week and a half it started turning brown like old blood I was taking the pill at exactly everyday and when I started my new pack I did good for two days then on my third day I was an hour late but still took it and the day after that I took it six minutes earlier But now Im on day and I took the pill at since day I havent had any SE but a couple days ago my back started to ache
9414,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42628,6,I have been on Lo Loestrin Fe for years which is more than awesome just make sure you take it at the same time everyday without stop As far as my sex life you have to be vigilantdate nights and times a week exercise I have four boys so I know about being exhausted You have to love yourself before you can love someone else Attitude is up to you It will go away but you must put up the effort to bring it back
9416,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42626,1,Only giving it a because it is protecting me from getting pregnant But the side effects are horrible Ive been on it for just month I already gained some weight my period never came for the month of September my mood swings are going crazy I always seem to cry for no damn reason which is ridiculous but today was my last pill and Im so happy for that time to start my old birth control pills
9417,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42625,11,Ive been on Lo Loestrin for about and my periods are either light or non exsistant which is great My cramps even lessened and I dont have to take anything for them anymore which is fantastic However Ive been bloated for months so much so that my clothes are tight and its embarrassing as I work out times a week and am very healthy My face breaks out all the time now with painful cyst like red dots that never form into a pimple and my face has always been clear My loved ones are complaining about my short fuse and major crankiness which isnt like me at all My sex drive is gone and Im in my early s it like happened over night Ill be switching to something immediately as I was hoping all this would go away
9418,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42624,7,I started this BC for severe bleeding and it was a horrible experience I am years old and this is the worst BC pill I have ever used I bled for days straight during my first period while on this pill It has also caused my face to break out horribly and awful mood swings It has also caused me to be severely bloated I would not recommend this to anyone
9419,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42622,5,Ive been on this for about months and have had a very positive experience except when I started taking it my bleeding continued for about a month I had some mild cramping which I didnt even have to take Advil for I got on this pill for endometriosis usually I have debilitating cramps and severe proctalgia fugax during my period and not have experienced any of that My only symptoms are breast tenderness for about the first month and Ive gained a couple of pounds at the most No acne Highly recommend
9421,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42621,8,I threw up constantly while using it the first months And I had constant mood swings amp hot flashes I also gained lbs
9423,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42620,3,I must say I really like this pill vs all the others Ive tried I was on minastrin before switching to this I gained lbs on the minastrin It also effected my mood terribly I was mad and angry all the time Ive been on lo loestrin for about months and I love it Ive already lost almost all the weight I gained and no mood swings I also dont have a period on this pill Thats a big bonus Not every person responds to the pill the same but Im so glad my OB have me this
9426,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42814,7,I started taking this pill around years ago and started to get extremely depressed My mom and I thought it was because of a boy I was seeing so I broke it off and also got off of the medicine thinking I wouldnt need it anymore About months ago I started on this same birth control again and have felt very emotionally overwhelmed and have not been myself at all I have made the decision to go off of this medicine for good this time and already seeing positive effects I do not at all recommend this product
9427,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42813,3,The best BC Ive tried Im taking it for one month and have minimal side effects My breasts slightly increased in size but no weight gain or acne Im taking it at night so I dont know if there are any headaches or nausea I dont have any during the day Love it
9428,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42812,6,I have been taking this for over a year with that being said I have had no period the entire time Ive been on it which is great The only biggest downside is my sex drive is completely gone sex is often very painful and without my natural lubrication it is hard for me to have sex for the few days after I have it This has been enough for me to want to switch my doctor told me is it common to become dry while taking low estrogen pills Im going to switch to a slightly higher pill in hopes of a higher sex drive
9429,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42811,8,AWFUL This birth control was the first my yr old daughter has been on After the first few days I noticed how irritable and moody she was I called the doctor she recommended to keep taking it and let her body adjust to it month taking this birth control She became very angry aggressive towards people and friends irritated all of the time short memory and memory loss irrational acts very depressed panic attacks and suicide attempt She thankfully is ok but very scary She doesnt even remember her snap decision to take her own life She just says she felt like everything was terrible and she didnt want to feel like that This is an extreme reaction I know but wanted to let it known what happened
9431,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42808,5,Gave this a rating because it did prevent pregnancy but having said that the side effects are not worth it No legitimate weight gain but water weight and bloating caused fluctuations daily of up to lbs up or down normally my weight is the same daily Night sweats due to low estrogen flat hair duller complexion total lack of sex drive and dry like the Sahara down there due to thickening of cervical mucus Definitely irritability and mood swings Stopped mid pack month one and feel much better after one day of this out of my system I was skeptical a pill could do all of the after reading the reviews but weeks in experiencing it myself they are all right Not worth trying to stick it out in case body adjusts in a few months
9434,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42799,4,I been on this BC pill for months going on months now I have mix feelings about it Its my first birth control pill and I didnt know what to expect but I read up on the side effects so far I have experience mood swings anxiety which I was already having issues with the pill made it worst when I do have episodes of it weight gain because I seem to crave sweets more often and lack of sex drive I also bleed ALOT my first two months into the pill like every two weeks and it lasted days and was very heavy but these last two months no period at all plus I havent been that sexually active I take the pill everyday at the same time amp I workout daily No serious breakouts from it but my breast have gotten bigger Which I love
9435,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42794,7,Rating it as a only because it kept me from getting pregnant and didnt make me moody or depressed like the NuvaRing did Lets just start off saying that I made the switch from the NuvaRing to LoLo because the doctor recommended it because of the lower dose of hormones The NuvaRing was great for my skin and regulating and shortening my periods but oh my god did it ever mess me up mentally I was tired all the time so moody and depressed made me feel suicidal and unhappy all the time so thats why I switched LoLo made my clear skin break out in cystic acne made me have little sex drive made me lose a tremendous amount of hair and totally messed up my periods and made me spot throughout the whole month I do not recommend LoLo
9437,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42789,5,This pill did not work for me After three days I started noticing severe mood swings mostly between irrational anger and despondency My perfectly clear skin also started to breakout I could never feel satiated not necessarily hungry but still snacking all the time unable to fall asleep and had horrible constipation I went off the pills and a week later still have most of the side effects although my insomnia has improved Definitely not for everyone hoping it will get out of my system soon
9438,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42788,30,Do not base your opinion off of these reviews It is important to remember birth control works differently for everyone I was absolutely terrified to go on any type of birth control pill because I find myself prone to side effects with these things and was already having bad anxiety Turns out this pill completely levelled me out I havent experienced any negative side effects at all except for the break through bleeding which is why I came on this site in the first place Besides that nothing Try it I feel as though my body actually really needed this since it seems as though its actually levelled out my anxiety
9439,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42788,8,This was my first BC I was on it for years My dr first prescribed so Id have a control my period and after a year and a half my periods started to only show up every months My periods were lighter when they were present I never had bad cramps I did lack serious sex drive and was dry as a desert after the year mark Acne never changed No appetite craze or weight gain
9440,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42785,9,Terrible birth control I do not recommend at all Everyone reacts differently but my experience with this pill gave me irreversible effects I had perfectly clear skin before taking this pill not one mark on my face but within the first month I got HUGE cysts all over the sides of my cheeks it killed my confidence It also made me extremely moody I would cry all the time Hopefully this doesnt happen to you but I just wrote this review as a warning
9441,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42779,7,I loved this birth control I had no negative side effects I took it for nine months and it took away my period completely which was great but was also scary because thats not natural and if you forget to take your pills on time you dont get a period to confirm youre not pregnant Unfortunately I now have to switch to another BC because my insurance no longer covers lo loestrin fe
9442,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42779,7,Omg Ive been taking it for less than a month and had enough of it already I turned me into a monster Im yelling at people crying all the time kicked out one of my clients from my office during our meeting Ive been having suicidal thoughts and been super depressed Also I have an uncontrollable appetite Ive been stuffing myself with white bread for days I dont eat white bread Im not supposed to But I just wake up in the morning and have these insane cravings for croissants Yesterday I had of them Surprisingly I havent gained any weight but my skin is breaking out due to my gluten and dairy allergies Its been a nightmare and I dont know what to do because Ive tried all kinds of BC and my body rejects everything
9443,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42779,4,I recently had a baby and went on my weeks pp check up My ob prescribed me these pills cause they were supposed to keep my milk supply at normal No complaints about that so farHowever I was lucky to experience every side effect mentioned by other ladies here tiredness cramping lower back pain my face broke out used to be super clear even during puberty I was unable to control my appetite lost all the baby weight in weeks after delivery and now started packing up these lbs again my belly went from flat to month pregnant within just weeks on these pills and of course a nonstop spotting was there tooI cannot switch to a higher estrogen level pills because of breastfeeding so I decided to switch to condoms for now
9444,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42778,5,The best BC pill around Ive only had one negative side effect total loss of sex drive I tried Blisovi after being on Lo loestrin for almost a year and had to immediately come off of it and went back to Lo lo My face has cleared up my cramps have gone away I hardly get a period no weight gain Definitely worth it
9446,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42774,5,This BC is not bad to be honest I mean this is the first one I have ever tried but I will be coming off completely in the next month I workout and eat right for the most part and I have gained lbs on this BC in less than months It is concerning and I would like to discontinue Also I have noticed less hair growth which I think is great but now for others I also noticed more migraines and more acne I have had more depressing thoughts and way more mood swings which I think is almost normal on BC However I really dont want to have tender breasts and significant weight gain and be a crazy person Different for everyone I suppose but not pregnant so thats a plusI also got my period twice a month on this and both bad
9447,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42773,10,Hi everyone I started taking lo Loestrin fe weeks ago I did have break through bleeding dont give up or get worried it will stop once your body gets use to it I really love This this pill I am not retaining water and I have no weight gain other pills make you gain weight and get hungry not this one I would recommend this highly
9449,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42620,8,First month was great Slightly more anxiety but thought it would surpass The pill got worse month by month More anxiety more depression Weight gain nauseavomiting extremely painful periods with crazy mood swings Cannot wait for this pack to be over so I can switch
9450,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42620,5,I am not one to write reviews about anything online but i thought Id share what happened to me while on this birth control I experienced very light to absolutely no periodswhich i was completely fine with I wanted to switch from Beyaz to something with a lower dose of hormones thinking that was a healthy choice for my body boy was I wrong I always had extremely clear skin but within the first months on this pill i started to experience severe cystic breakouts that were so painful and red I didnt want to leave my house and made me so self conscious I also experienced dizziness and anxiety that came out of the blue I cannot take the breakouts anymore so Im switching back to Beyaz tomorrow which I never had a problem with
9452,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42618,7,Great experience No side effects I still have a period but thats okay I highly recommend Dont let previous reviews detour you from giving it a try
9455,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42616,2,I am I have had endometrial ablation that has been very successful I have not had a period in years I have suffered with adult acne since I was in my early s I have tried everything I had a laporsocpy in for severe endometriosis Well a few months ago I started hurting pretty bad Random and not continous I went to obgyn and he put me on this Lo Loestrrine Le birth control pill He sad it will help with pain and acne Well pain has been much better but my face looks like connect the dot amd they are big and they hurt I called him last week and he has switched me to Ortho Tri Cyclin lo So we shall see
9457,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42614,6,I took this pill for about a year It was the first birth control pill I had ever taken My period stopped completely and my mood swings went away I did get some pimples but that could be due to anything I had to stop taking it because of the price but I recommend it
9458,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42611,6,My doctor put me on lo loestrin fe for my endometriosis It worked for the heavy bleeding and the pain I also gained some weight pounds in mths of using it which I dont mind because I was underweight to begin with I only have very light periods I have also noticed a change in mood I had terrible pms mood swings and depression and now thats all gone Im in a stable mood all month long However as soon as I started taking it my face broke out in cystic acne the worst ever Its getting worse every day and I cant keep taking this drug My face is covered in dark marks and painful volcano like zits Its also so oily I also grew two spiky long chin hairs
9459,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42611,5,Ive been on this pill for around weeks and so far so good I have a bit of bloatinggas pain and breast tenderness but other than that I am thrilled The cost is a bit high as there arent any generic versions of this exact pull out there but to me its been worth the cost
9460,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42610,2,This is the first birth control pill Ive ever been on and Im I got on the pill because I was having really painful periods and I had recently become sexually active Month was amazing barely any side effects at all I started it on day of my period and my period was way heavier than usual During the placebo period week I got a much lighter and manageable period So everything is well right WRONG I started pack and during week I start to get this awful cramping in my stomach like how I would days before my period Then the cramping gets X worse and I go from spotting a little brown blood to having a FULL BLOWN PAINFUL PERIOD Im supposed to go on Junel next month but I might just switch to a higher dose pill
9462,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42602,8,I have been taking this medication for about a week now and my main purpose for it was to regulate and lighten my periods as well as help with acne After days of taking it I kept waking up with really bad cramps and brown spotting which is really annoying I feel bloated all the time and I experience really bad gas pain I also have really bad headaches and felt nauseous everyday so far I really hope all this stuff starts to subside and starts working
9463,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42602,11,Im seeing so many negative reviews and I understand everyones bodies react differently but I have ZERO complaints about this pill Ive been on it for almost a year now was put on for heavypainful periods and acne and it solved all of my menstrual problems I have not had a period since starting this pill which has been great for me considering how bad they were prior my acne has cleared I havent had mood swingsweight gain etc I couldnt be happier
9467,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42600,3,I am and have been taking Lo Loestrin for months I did not use any form of contraceptive prior I started taking it because after my period turned into an unrecognizable beast to the point of unbearable Doctor said I was fine just getting olderStarted LOLO I did all the research and prepared myself for a horrible transition It took about weeks for my body to acclimate I experienced fatigue bloating headaches stomach aches and gained lbs The side effects didnt all happen the entire time and they werent severe so much as inconvenient But knowing poss side effects did help me stick it out SO GLAD I DID All side effects gone No add weight gain and period is back to NORMAL use coupon for discount
9468,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42591,8,Ive just completed my first pack and for me so far so good Theres always so may negatives that I thought Id do a positive I was on the Mirena for months the worst for me I essentially bledspotted for those months gained weight amp had severe back acne Im surprised I held out that long Had Mirena removed along w a polyp and bc of high BP Im on lolo No nausea headaches bloating mood swings at all Only quotissuequot is some minor spotting for about days Im pretty sure this is bc I didnt know when my actual cycle was with Mirena so I just started lolo the day after my polyp removal Im guessing my body is just trying to figure itself out Im hopeful the spotting will stop and Ill be back to quotnormalquot soon
9469,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42589,13,My doctor prescribed me Lo Loestrin when I was to treat my heavy irregular periods and cramps that would cause me to stay home from schoolother obligations for days at a time It worked perfectly for me for the years that I used it My periods lightened and became extremely regular and it worked as pregnancy prevention later as well I didnt experience any abnormal weight gain and it didnt affect my acne whatsoever neither lightened it nor made it heavier I would definitely recommend LLF
9470,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42586,8,Had almost every side effect Gained weight very moody my face and back broke out bad which I usually never have very tender breast frequent headaches tired Was just NOT a good experience after months I couldnt take it anymore Scared to try a different one now since how bad of an experience this was
9472,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42579,19,Excellent Do not be afraid of the reviews Everyone is different Im tried others but this is by far the best No weight gain less mood swings overall fantastic Biggest challenge is taking the pill at the same time everyday
9474,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42538,4,Im and this is my first birth control to have My doctor basically pressured me that this selective medicine was the right choice for me I have been taking this pill for about one week prior to being off my menstrual cycle in the midst of taking these pills I rapidly began another menstrual cycle or what some call quotbreak through bleedingquot Ive also became very emotionally to the point where I would call my mother and cry And lastly my doctor advised me it would ease my cramps which was a lie it actually made the pain worst I didnt even finish my first week before I changed to another BC
9476,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42536,25,I feel like because there arent many positive posts on here I should share one I got on this pill because of reoccurring ovarian cysts and also to relieve some menstrual pain during periods Im on the third month and I have had no negative side effects The only thing was I had black disgusting discharge for about a week at the beginning but it stopped However I noticed that if I dont take the pill at the same time every day or relatively close to the same time I begin having that discharge again However I have not experienced any mood swings weight gain or any other negative side effects Every pill affects every woman differently so please dont get freaked out by negative reviews like I did actually dont even read them
9478,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42534,1,I started taking this pill weeks ago when i started my period After starting it my period disappeared Well weeks later my period returned severely I had severe cramps unlike anything i have ever had and im I called my doctor she said it was normal to be like this for the first months on the pill I have now been bleeding for days and the severe cramps continued up until i went off the pill myself Besides the cramps i was extremely moody and depressed Be careful on this pill
9479,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42530,4,I was on the Depo shot the first months were great Loved it well I went in to get my second shot and they gave it to me in the stomach I bled for three months STRAIGHTI lgot contact dermatitis in my vaginal opening and soreness from the tampons I wasnt dry just irritated down there Well I couldnt take it anymore and my hormones were crazy My boyfriend and I started dating in the mix of all this Everything was fine for the first two months So while I was on the depo my GYNO put me on a progesterone tablet to stop the bleeding which worked I ran out of those and started bleeding again She put me in LOLO worse mistake of my life the bleeding has stopped but I have been awful Mean dryness and irritation months In Im done
9480,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42530,7,Im not sure how to rate it as this is my first birth control amp I have nothing to compare it toSo far Ive been on it for a month amp a half amp havent experienced anything lifechanging My skin doesnt get nearly as much breakout before my period which has been niceI havent gained any significant weight amp my breasts havent gone up in size thank godI did however experience a day long period when I started taking this bc It wasnt painful just annoying I no longer experience quotspottingquot but rather I get a thick dark reddishbrown discharge at random which is also annoying As for mood changes it has been mostly elated rather than down which has been incredible
9481,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42530,7,Loved this birth control Had to switch pills due to a change in my health insurance plan In the mean time I have tried Yaz Cryselle and have had unpleasant side effects with both pills I had no negative side effects on Lo Loestrin Fe Clear skin no periods positive mood and no weight gain
9482,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42530,7,I am years old and I took them for months and in that time I never got my period I gave it some time to see if my period would come down and nothing I even took pregnancy test to make sure I wasnt pregnant About months into the pill I started getting anxiety and very depressed thats when my husband realized that it might be the pills that have my hormones all out of whack amp had me feeling like this so I stopped them I had never experienced depression before and everything I had done in the past started to bother me I have lost a significant amount of weight amp even though I stopped the pills a month ago they triggered my depression and now Im even seeking a phycologist help I rather be pregnant than so server my depressed
9484,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42529,7,I gave it a two star because while it was the worst birth control ever I didnt get pregnant I guess it did its jobThe side effects are simply not worth itWithin the first week I was breaking out more than I did when I was going through puberty and not just the small pimples Im talking painful cystic acne My cramps were amplified x I had the worst pms and the tenderness of my breasts was almost unbearable I couldnt even sleep comfortably I thought it would go away once my body adjusted NOI got off of it and notice all my symptoms had vanishedI started using my old birth control again which I stopped using because it caused me to bloat a lot but I would rather bloat than feel what I felt on Lo loestrin
9485,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42527,4,This birthcontrol is terrible I am years old was given this since I was diagnosed with PCOS I took it for weeks and stopped The nd week I was bleeding bad cramping and clotting as wellI just assumed it was my body getting used to it after that I got bad bloating to the point that my bladder had pressure on it and I felt the full urgency feeling but did not have a UTI I had horrible depression and anxiety as well i am not a anxious or depressed person It drove me NUTS I stopped taking it and it took days to get out my system and have me feel back to normal I have some zits now from it as well but thats better than all that other crazy stuff
9486,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42527,8,I wish I never took this pill Im not a pill popping kind of person But I had to think about my future with my boyfriend and decided just to try one pill out This was the lowest dose so I figured it would be fine Definitely not I havent been eating or motivated as much as I usually am Im an emotional person but this pill turned me into a monster I have never been so sad in my entire life I had thoughts of harming myself and was constantly causing arguments with my boyfriend who Ive been with for w year and a half and weve never had these problems It has given me horrible head aches and anxiety I would never suggest this to anyone
9487,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42525,1,Lolo seemed to work fine for me for the first couple months I was a bit more emotional than usual but wrote it off as stress and it is hard to tell if anything was caused by the pill It is important to note that I was pretty inactive at the time aside from some walking However upon beginning a new workout regime I began to experience horrible cramping similar to period cramping and breakthrough bleeding This was halfway through my third pill pack I believe something about the heavy exercise prompted it as it does with my period In an unrelated incident I hurt my knee pretty badly and have taken a few days off working out The cramps remain and are horrible I wonder if something else is wrong with me I want this to end
9489,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42521,2,I started taking Lo Loestrin Fe as a form of birth control Within the first week I had cramps tender breasts and break through bleeding By the time the second week came I realized that I started getting a little more emotional crying at things I normally wouldnt getting offended over little reasons etc In week I woke up so nauseous that I almost threw up for days straight By the time I was halfway through my second pack I was a complete lunatic Screaming at my boyfriend over the stupidest things not thinking reasonably about ANYTHING crying for no reason at all I stopped taking this pill and within days felt COMPLETELY better I am now on a different pill and do not have this problem I dont recommend lolo
9490,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42520,6,I have been on Lolo Estrin FE for about a year and a half now This is my first BC pill After taking it for the first time I basically had what felt like severe PMS for a week or so accompanied by cramps general moodiness and spotting After that it seemed to even out and things got better My main complaint is that I seem to be much moodier than Ive ever been in the past during my period becoming depressed and I have almost no sex drive I have had major breast tenderness in the first few months of taking it feels like my boobs were getting bigger and just achy Ive gained a little weight lb but nothing unusual But I also cant seem to lose it either I bike everyday for at least an hour and am generally a healthy eater
9491,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42514,6,I was on this pill for over months and it has been the worst experience When I first started taking it it was fine but months into it I started gaining weight And gained up to pounds My breasts went from a b to almost a d cup and hurt all the time I was super angry and depressed all the time It got to the point where I did not want to get out of bed and go on with my normal routine I lost many friendships due to being depressed I also did not go to school for over weeks I would never recommend this pill to anyone I should of not taken it when I saw the reviews the first time I just switched to a different pill and already lost pounds in weeks
9494,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42513,3,I was on this pill for just three weeks and noticed a major increase in anxiety and depression I was miserable until I realized it wss from this pill I stopped it immediately and shortly began feeling so much better If you have a history of anxiety do not take this pill
9495,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42512,3,I hate BC I have tried them all I stayed off of them for several years and became tired with condoms and finally gave in Well I gained lbs and did everything to lose it I had the sweetest sexiest bf and he broke up with me after months on the pill which I took for him because I became a crazy emotional mess I fought with anyone and everyone I was unmotivated and severely depressed to the extreme It is not worth it Just use condoms or refrain from sex You have a better chance of a long term relationship with no sex at all than becoming the crazy monster this pill makes you
9497,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42508,2,The first few months I took Lo Lo Fe seemed to go well A few mood swings and headaches but I figured my body needed time to get used to it Fast forward months and I still have headaches every day mood swings issues with labido stomach cramps fatigue feeling sad and down all the time and I have gained pounds No matter how much I work out or how good I eat my weight goes up every time I step on the scale I finally decided to quit taking it All the issues arent good for me
9501,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42465,7,This birth control pill caused me to have multiple blood clots in my lungs Very dangerous ladies beware
9504,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42461,15,WORST BIRTH CONTROL EVERI was taking this pill for a little over a year and yea I gained about lbs and had breakouts but the real issues were that it made me extremely irritable emotional as well as depressed my sex drive became nonexistent and I was having severe dryness plus yeast infections So I guess yes it completely worked as an effective birth control because I just didnt want to have sex plus what boyfriend would want to have sex with their emotionally crazy girlfriend who is dry or having a yeast infectionHonestly Ive been off of it for months but I remember even after the first week off my body was normalizing and I felt radiant STAY AWAY FROM THIS PILL Youve been warned
9506,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42461,4,This is by far the best pill I have ever tried and let me tell you Ive tried almost everything out there in the past six years Alesse was the only one that almost worked for me and I was on it for two years but I never really got over the nausea and the mood swings With Lo Lo I have not experienced any mood swings no weight gain no nausea no tenderness or pain Nothing I even managed to take it continuously not to get my period which I havent been able to do with any other pill I would always end up getting my period sometimes in the middle of my cycle Id always get breakthrough bleeding This one just works perfectly for me Im at four months of use and I dont plan on changing it anytime soon
9511,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42458,7,I really like this pill The only major lasting side effect was weight gain and I did put on quite a few pounds within a couple months but its nothing too worrisome I also have never gotten my period will on this pill and it has been about a year now since I have first taken it I have talked to my physician and it is normal All I get is a bit of brownish substances when Im on the sugar pills My acne has cleared up wonderfully I have such great skin and have gotten many compliments on it The downside is my skin has dried up quite a bit but moisturizer helps Overall I really love this brand of birth control but because I want to follow a more natural path for my menstrual cycle I will be swapping to a different brand
9513,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42458,3,I started taking this birth control months ago and it has been the WORST experience for me The crazy mood swings that I developed while on this medication made a huge impact on the way I treated my boyfriend and my family I broke up with my boyfriend twice over ridiculous reasons because my emotions were so crazy Also my acne on my face has never been worse I never break out when NOT on birth control and all of the sudden while on this I have severe acne I didnt even finish my last week of my nd month I told my boyfriend I would rather use condoms andor not have sex right now then feel like this I havent had a pill in days my face is already clear and my mood seems to be leveling out I would NOT recommend
9515,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42458,3,Ive been on this pill for nearly a year now and for the past three months I have been having weird bleeding When it first started I bleed for days before getting my same day heavy period I have break through bleeding all the time which is really worrying Even though Im not ovulatin I still track my period and it freaks me out Ive lost like pounds and I cant gain wait Other than these issued its ok Has anyone else experienced break through bleeding a year later
9516,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42455,0,Im yrs old I started taking lo loestrin fe about a year ago As soon as I started taking the pill I felt fine My weight was not effected and my acne actually cleared up Overall I was happy about the pill Anywho I stopped the pill for about a month because my script went up and a ton of other inconveniences came up I immediately began taking the pill the following month but I noticed my hair is falling out Im sure this is due to stopping the pill I already have thin hair so this is freaking me out Its coming out in chunks and I shed a lot throughout the daySince my skin is prone to cystic acne thats whats appearing on my face and back Im not sure what to do Change BC or stay on this and let my body adjust
9517,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42454,1,I really like this BC overall I have PMDD and my anxiety has decreased dramatically along with my panic attacks and other events that were associated with the PMDD However the only downside is that my sex drive has decreased quite a bit I have noticed a slight increase in ingrown hairs on my face as well but my doctor told me both side effects were not uncommon I have had to consider this against taking my BC as I am married however I have decided to continue on because it overall makes me feel better and is very effective
9519,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42453,1,I have been taking this medication for about years It has been my first and only BC so far Changes ive noticed after taking it I cry very easily At the drop of a hat LOL Also big thing is that my period completely STOPPED as opposed to having day heavyish periods before Sure ive had breakthrough bleeding and spotting but thats because in the past I have not been thorough taking it If I do stop taking it my period comes pretty soon after Beside that I havent noticed anything else I do get tired easily but that could definitely be associated with other things
9520,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42452,1,My yr old daughter started this to help her with severe periods and to help regulate them she is not sexual active The first months were ok She did not get a period which was a little bothersome but normal she has since had period She started her rd month of pills was about way through when it became very apparent there was something off about her Bursting into tears over nothing not sleeping very very moody totally not herself She actually didnt understand why she was feeling the way she was she said thats whats most bothersome there is nothing wrong and yet I feel awful She had to stop taking them she tried to do the every nd day to slower wean her but we had to just stop
9523,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42451,0,Before lolo I was on aleese and it was terrible for my skin Before I changed birth controls I noticed my discharge was brown my doctor said this was normal but it slowly got heavier and now that Ive started loloa little over a week ago I have bad cramps and Ive been bleeding the entire time on lolo Also when I get up Im very dizzy and easily exhausted Im not sure if it has changed my skin yet
9524,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42506,13,I have been taking Lo Loestrin Fe for over A year now its the best birth control Ive ever taken I use to have heavy cycles the worst cramps and would have to take off work because of being nausea and sick once a month I would wear ultra tampon with the biggest pads u could find My iron was low because of how much blood I would lose a month Since my doctor prescribed this pill I have maintain my weight I no longer take iron tablets and my periods are very light It still comes on but sometimes it skips a month and the next month it may stay on two weeks Long as you maintain a healthy diet it works out fine Give this a try and see if it works for you
9525,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42505,2,I was put in this pill to help with heavy bleeding well Im in my first month I bled every single day from the first to the last pill the cramping is unbearable it feels like contractions I called my doctors office and I was told to continue taking them and give it months but I dont know if I want to do that Im miserable another thing I noticed is my breast are bigger I know doctors say its a myth but no its a reality I never had this issue with any other pill Its weird because these pills are very low in hormones I just hope they dont continue getting bigger
9527,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42500,5,Took almost months of this pill First month went fine Almost no side effects felt less hungry during first month nd month felt nauseous at times slight headaches Bleeding was very light lasted maybe day or rd month started having stomach pains and lower back spasms Couldnt find other cause of spasms I had no injury etc Until I found a rare side effect of this med could be spasm Stopped taking pill midway of the rd month couple days agohavent felt a spasm since Back to square one
9529,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42500,2,I am just finishing up my rd pack aka finishing my rd month and I havent ever felt depressed like this ever before Sure the first months I got some mood swings and i was very emotional but now my anxiety is being triggered and I have no appetite Al I want to do is stay home and sleep I feel sad and uninterested in anything Will be switching soon and hopefully I can go back to happy me Didnt experience any weight gain and it did not help with my acne
9530,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42497,5,So far I have been taking this pill for three weeks The first week I was just spotting The nd amp rd week my period has been extremely heavy with huge blood clots and very bad abdominal pain Going to see my GYN again Still have had my period now for days Very uncomfortable
9534,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42490,4,Spotty and longweird periods at first Now have regulated and seem to be on schedule my last period was truly two light days Yay I used to completely soak through a super plus tampon in hours before starting this pill and now I can wear light tampons without a backup pad Ive noticed some breast tenderness and I do feel that I tend be more sensitive emotionally or feel like crying more easily than before I am not normally very emotional However its nothing to a significant level Totally manageable emotions for me and only last a couple days at a time Seems to be working as far as no babies go No affected libido no weight gain no skin issues no nausea etc
9535,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42490,7,Ive been on this pill for about a month and a half now and I have had the WORST experience This is my first time on the pill because I had awful period pains I was on my period for weeks straight on this pill I have become an emotional irritable mess Ive yelled at my boyfriend for the dumbest things and cry at literally EVERYTHING This pill has made me crazy moody and psycho And even my sister and boyfriend have noticed a change in my personality Also my skin has never been this worse Ive gotten clumps of cystic acne all along my chin neck and cheeks It is SO bad I am planning on stopping because it is doing nothing for me I would NOT recommend
9536,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42488,10,I was on this pill for four months A week after I started it I noticed my hair was significantly thinner than normal The hair loss kept getting worse over the next few months which is terrifying I can assure you I quickly fell into a black hole of depression which I had never had problems with before I also had no libido and horrible dryness to the point that it hurt to even touch my labia I also gained weight in weird places and had the quotpregnant woman bodyquot I quit the pill two weeks ago and its like a black cloud has been lifted off me Im crying reading these reviews because its such a relief to know Im not crazy If youre on this pill just watch out for the side effects and know its not you its the pill
9537,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42485,5,I wouldnt recommend this BC It made me feel like I was in my first trimester of pregnancy againnauseated exhausted aversion to food etc On top of that towards the end of the first month I ended up with major depression from this pill Not to mention the spotting I really wanted to give my body the full months to adjust to this pill but I couldnt do it I hope people have better luck than me but if you have the same experience Id say get off Lolo ASAP
9538,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42485,8,While this was an effective contraceptive the negative side effects were beyond unbearable Within the first week I experienced the most horrible cystic acne break out of my life The progesterin in this pill is androgen based which is found to increase acne Additionally my mood swings were wild and I found myself feeling incredibly depressed I would cry for literally no reason This birth control ruined my skin I switched to a different BC and since then my skin and mood have improved exponentially
9540,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42480,2,I started taking Lo Loestrin when I was in high school for painful periods years ago and it was great My periods got so much lighter and I loved it I did get nauseous occasionally and sometimes had breakthrough bleeding but nothing too crazy I could live with it All of the sudden in the past year and even moreso in the past few months I have had decreased libido and mood swings The libido issue is really taking a toll on my relationship so ive decided to switch I do still recommend this pill though I overall had a good experience with it especially for my awful periods
9541,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42476,2,So Im going to begin with my first birth control Beyaz I was taking it for about months until I realized it made me BAT SHIT CRAZY Other than than I had NO weight gain at all and I felt like my normal self My doctor switched me to Loestrin so that it would make my mood quotbetterquot and it did Ill give it that Until one day I noticed I was feeling a little pudgy It was about mid October so I stepped on the scale to see I WAS RIGHT I gained pounds in months from and when I got off of it it completely jacked up my already irregular cycle So here I am months later waiting to have another period and still not able to lose the weight I just recently began seeing a doctor about these issues
9544,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42472,3,Well I was going to write a full out review but apparently theres not even room for that here So Ill make it short I am Ive been taking this for months In the beginning all was well then it made me sick to my stomach everyday I kept taking this in hopes that it would subside It did For the past two months this BC has turned me into the moodiest person Ive ever been in my life Im rude and Ive never been this way I would NOT recommend this to anyone Its ruining my year relationship I can no longer proceed with this medication DO NOT take
9546,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42470,2,I used this pill for less than full months The st month I had headaches breast tenderness and nausea The nd month I spotted for days straight I even had cramps I also had nausea and felt really hungry The rd and th month were the best Short periods almost no cramps I also had a little acne The th month I started to spot pills in and I havent stopped since Its been days I switched pills days ago and Im still spotting because of LoLo Its not a terrible pill but I dont recommend it Spotting continuously is really not fun and expensive Im hopeful my new birth control will get the spotting to stop soon
9547,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42470,8,Ive been on this pill for about months and I didnt experience any weight gain My only issue with this pill is that I get very emotional during the third week of the pill Doctors recommend taking a Bcomplex vitamin at the same time I didnt know this at first but once I started doing this I noticed a positive change but still had that mood swing in the third week I would just get a little obsessive and cry easily Just remember that each pill works differently for everyone So a pill that makes one person gain weight might make another lose weight
9548,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42468,4,My doc gave me the sample pack today he told me out of all the contraception pills this one has very little estrogen which causes the unwanted effects Ive been having since getting my iud almost a year ago Im looking forward to starting it and getting my iud removed in weeks For the girls complaining about pound weight gain I dont recommend getting the mirena as in the past year Ive gained over pounds O
9549,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42450,2,Im and this is my first BC pill I can be nervous about taking new meds but decided to give this a try I like this pill The only major side effects Ive noticed are some breakthrough bleeding which wasnt severe or a big deal for me and sore boobs Slightly reduced sex drive I like this pill cause its a low dose and I honestly dont feel very different from when I wasnt on it Everyone is different but Would recommend trying it
9552,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42448,2,My biggest issue on this pill was the mood swings and irritability I was ALWAYS on edge and felt angry for no reason to the point that I questioned why me and my fianceacute were even getting married if I was so annoyed with him being around all the time Within days of being off this birth control pill I feel x better Im genuinely happy and like myself again I had severe cramping right before my period gut wrenching pain My period were light and only lasted days I had a little bit of water retention but didnt notice much weight gain I personally would never ever use this brand again to be honest me and my fianceacute are just using condoms for now and I feel so good not being on the pill at all
9553,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42447,4,Lolo has been awesome I used to have day periods before I went on my first pill On Lolo I have almost none and when they do happen occasionally and as predicted they last days I heard it can increase frequency of headaches and I have had a couple more here and there but Id say thats probably just me not drinking enough waterNo weight gain no acne issues Cant recommend it enough
9554,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42446,1,When I initially started Lo Loestrin FE I felt really weirdemotional That lasted for about months and Ive been completely fine ever since My breast felt very tender in the beginning and my acne cleared up and my nails became very stronghealthy as well I think my body got used to the pill because I do experience more breakouts now I also experienced a little bit of spotting in the beginning but havent had a period for years Overall Ive been very happy with this pill
9555,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42446,2,Im not sure why this is rated so badly I love this birth control Ive had no problems with my mood and I have been on it for about a year months after taking it I stopped getting my period I looked it up and it says that this pill does tend to make your period much lighter and shorter I had a pretty light period to begin with so this could be the cause Anyway no problems with this pill at all
9556,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42445,4,I have been on OCPS Apri Aviane and Lo Loestrin FeI was not able to tolerate Apri and Aviane My side effects included depression and general feeling of sickness headache and extreme nausea Change in mood hypersensitivity Increase in breast sizebut no breast sensitivity No skin breakout or acneThe women in my family suffer from depression anxiety and are not able to tolerate OCPs very well After consulting with my Gyne she recommended Lo Loestrin Fe Ive only been on Lo Loestrin Fe for days So far Ive had a great experience The only minor effect but tolerable are night sweats I take the pill pm slight increase in anxiety slight stomach upset Gyne gave me a sample so Im unsure of price w insurance
9557,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42444,0,Just started my th pack and honestly I wish I didnt On my th pack I started to experience break through bleeding brown discharge for about days It would then clear up I would be good to go for another week and then again brown discharge It happened times on my last pack So Im on my th pack now The discharge cleared up last Tuesday its now Monday and its happening again SO UNHAPPY WITH THIS I have went through a pack of tampons in month NOT IMPRESSEDIm also experiencing mood swings as well One week Im good to go happy as can be next week Im angry and sad So Im going to my doctors tomorrow to try something else This break through bleeding is really starting to suck not only for me but my bf too
9558,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42444,2,This birth control is terrible Ever since starting this birth control Ive been moody miserable and depressed and cry at every single thing Not to mention I have perfect skin before taking this amp it is now terrible filled with blemishes
9559,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42444,1,I found this by literally searching on google why am I feeling depressed and crying everyday I started the pill weeks ago and cant say how miserable it has made me feel
9560,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42440,2,I have been on this pill for months and it is the first birth control pill that I have ever been on I cant even describe how horrible my experience was with this pill I have had mood swings ever day starting early in the morning after I take it and lasting until I go to sleep I have been so incredibly irritated even the slightest thing will cause me to become angry or upset The amount of tears I have cried could fill a pond I know that everyone has a different experience with their birth control pill but this has been the worst experience in my life My psychologicist has me diagnosed with severe depression I feel bad for anyone else who has taken this pill and has had the same reaction I am starting a different next month
9561,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42440,2,While on this birth control Ive had major mood swings to the point where the people in my house walk on egg shells around me I feel extremely annoyed and angry all the time I also have been super spacey like Im daydreaming all day I cant concentrate on anything Not sure if its the birth control though I cant wait to switch birth controls I finally made it to the dr to get a new one prescribed
9562,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42439,2,I began taking this in August months ago I have been such a happier person and not having cramps from my use to be periods is awesome that only problem I have it that I am extremely bloated weeks of the month and its started to really bother me with summer around the corner Plus I dont like feeling bloated most the time
9564,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42437,3,Ive been on this pill for about a month and the past weeks have been good but the last week ive been bleeding lightly and everytime i urinate there have been blood clots for the past four days
9565,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42436,13,Ive been on LoLo since July months and I only have positive things to say about this pill I began this rx because I wanted something super low dosage and to help mediate the horrendous pain associated with my periods Well I havent had a period since August which is so wonderful for me No weight gain no break outs but I have noticed lately that each month about a week before my inactive pills Ill experience some major breast tenderness and soreness Am I alone in feeling that
9566,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42434,3,I started this prescription on Dec By January I had a blood clot that started in my calf I do not recommend this pill for use
9568,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42433,3,Made me get my period every weeks and I would take it every night at the same time It made my period cramps and back pain worse
9570,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42431,1,I reaally wanted to like this Bc as Ive been off for a few years as depo made my bones thin but its only the th day and I my breasts are so sore have to wear a bra all the time and Im a tiny gal Im used to being moody the day before my menses but Ive been moody for the whole week on this and my period has gone on for way more Im going back to what worked eating healthy exercise and condoms
9573,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42429,7,I love this I take this pill and was so scared of being on birth control due to side effects of weight gain and mood swings but Ive had absolutely no symptoms at all with this pill Definitely recommend since it has given me no negative side effects at all As long as it stays effective I will continue to use Loestrin so glad I found a reliable birth control
9574,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42398,6,I never write reviews but figured this might help someone out I HATED Lo loestrin fe It made me super depressed and I gained pounds on it Not to mention I bled for two weeks straight during the second month of taking it After I got off this pill I felt so much better This pill really was awful and messed with me more than a higher dose estrogen pill would never recommend this
9575,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42398,2,I began taking this pill in August I have since gained pounds that I can not get rid of and for the past two months Ive had two periods a month Needless to say I called my doctor and asked to change This pill was the worst Ive ever taken
9578,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42396,1,Ive been on different birth control pills includes lo loestrin I am years old around pounds and quot My OBGYN prescribed this pill months ago with the hopes of alleviating my heavy bleeding and fatigue Now all womens bodies react differently to these pills This review is based on how my body reacted to lo loestrin PROs no periods just light bleeding at times energy pregnancy prevention CONs anxiety aggrevation weight gain I felt like I was eating for two strange chest pain on the left small break outs My OBGYN accidently prescribed me back on my old BC accidently meaning to prescibe me on Lolo I was glad she made that mistake because I did not like the way this pill made me feel
9579,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42395,2,I LOVE this pill Some people might be scared by no period but I wasnt I never got my period while I was on it and I never had any mood swings or weight gain I did however after years of taking started to stay dry during intercourse But I got off the pill and my lubrication turned back to normal months after being off Other than that I highly suggest this pill
9580,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42390,15,I tried a lowdose generic for a few months and it made me feel crazy I switched to name brand Lo Loestrin months ago and so far I love it Ive heard from several pharmacists that the ingredients are better quality when you do name brand No breakthrough bleeding period is very light when I take the placebo week and so far no weight gain I have a bit of bloating but nothing I cant control by staying hydrated and somewhat active The best part is that my sex drive has been THROUGH THE ROOF Like better than it was before starting the birth control I love itMy only complaint is that it doesnt seem to help my ovarian cysts too much Im really hoping that I dont have to switch againBut overall I love this bc
9582,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42390,5,Im only giving lolo a because its quotlow hormonequot and I feel ok about taking it but oh my god my experience has been terrible My doctor ended up giving me a years supply do to certain circumstances so I figured I had to just keep taking it and hope it gets better but ever since I started its just been the worst Ive been on it for about to months now and I still get days of break through bleeding in between actual period days Pretty sure its made me gain a fair bit of weight Im the heaviest Ive ever been Im constantly nauseous there are times more often now where I have no appetite everything I eat hurts my stomach and will cause diarrhea Im going off of it because I cant remember the last time I actually felt OK
9583,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42389,4,This BC pill is not for me I have bled everyday since starting this pill and have had anxiety attacks which I have never experienced before
9584,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42389,9,Truly exceptional pill Ive been on it for almost a year At first I had a little breakthrough bleeding buts thats the only adverse side effect Ive encountered My boobs went from an A to a C I have no cramping really light periods that last days and Ive had no weight gain Would recommend to anyone
9585,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42387,2,At first this was a really good experience I have been on different generic birth controls previously starting when I was for regulating my period Im now and when I started Lo Lo it only took a month to regulate and my periods only lasted days I had little negative change in mood swings and sex drive was average But after a few months I started getting terrible vaginal dryness making sex uncomfortable And after EVERY period then on I got a mild yeast infection I was getting one every single month after only experiencing one before in my whole life I knew it was the LO Lo My gyno said it was probably not the Bc but I switched and after months on the new stuff I was no longer getting yeast infections Wouldnt recommend
9586,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42385,4,Took LoLo FE for months for heavy bleeding from a fibroid amp it was my first BC ever at Never missed a pill The st month placebo left me w the heaviest flooding from a period I had ever experienced Bled through super tampons amp overnight pads in about an hour but I wanted to give the pills months so I continued The heavy flooding lots of big clots lasting ish days periods continued every month then in the middle of the rd month I had breakthrough bleeding weeks before my period that never stopped By the middle of my th pack Id had enough since it was just making my periods worse No other bad sideeffects but havent seen any other reviews like this Switched to a POP last month going better so far
9587,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42385,3,Please note this is the only birth control pill I have taken I started this pill due to periods that lasted two weeks out of the month and resulted in terrible migraines and anemia Due to the fact that I started this pill at years of age Im not sure if it has impacted my mood Though when I took a year break my hormones were completely off balanced which is what led to me to return to the pill After a year of use this pill made my periods nonexistent I was told not to worry about this since its a normal thing for women on this pill to experience if theyre in a lower weight range I gained perhaps lbs on this pill but that also couldve just been from growing Ive been on it for years
9588,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42384,7,Loved this birth control Didnt have mood swings or gain weight Also didnt have a period except for an exceptionally light one every months or so which was great in my opinion Only reason I had to stop was because my stupid work switched insurance companies and the new one didnt cover this
9589,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42384,4,I started taking this birth control and on the th day I had a anxiety attack something I have never had or experienced in my life However I was under a lot of stress so that could of been the reason to Since you start this pill on the first day of your period my bleeding lasted days Once I got into the second month on the rd row only weeks later I got another period that also lasted about days In my third pack i got my period days later and Ive been bleeding for days straight the bleeding just never stopped I ended up having to contact my gyno to switch to another pill Also had acne which was new to me Only good thing was no weight gain
9590,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42383,4,I give it a instead of a only because I didnt get pregnant I was on this pill for months I had my period for days of every month I was on it My boobs were significantly bigger and I put on about lbs I was moody bloated and irritable Wouldnt recommend
9591,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42382,6,Having tried different pills plus Implanon implant I can finally say I found a pill that works for me Its changed my life Sounds dramatic but its true before no matter which pill I was experiencing excruciating cramps back aches mood swings and very heavy bleeding for at least days Lo Lo Estrin Fe has changed all that I dont have a period at all which doesnt worry me Im happy not to go through that pain every month Now I have a few small signals that I would normally be having my period slight back ache slightly more emotional Overall Im really happy with it I think its down to the dosage level the very low amount of estrogen works really well for me years and counting
9592,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42382,2,This pill has been awesome in regulating my moods and periods My periods are only days long and I have stopped having to take my prescribed pain medication when bleeding Period is about X lighter than it used to be Ive been having really vivid and cool dreams since I started taking this pill so thats pretty nice as well Bonus my boobs have grown so much and are so much perkier and round now
9593,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42380,4,Be careful when you take this The first time I popped a blue pill my tongue felt itchy and tingled I thought nothing of it Gradually I had noticed that my reproductive organs were acting up but I thought it would just go away It got to the point where they were so sore I couldnt use tampons without being in constant pain Not to mention I had a strange clear discharge that would soak through the tampon leaking through my pants and staining the chair at work That was fun My gyno didnt know what it was which was comforting months into it and with the mentality that everything would just go away with continued use I broke into hives everywhere on my body inside my ears all over my tongue everywhere you can think of
9596,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42378,4,Im taking these pills for almost months and I have spotting almost nonstop Other than that no side effects I will stop taking LoLo if my spotting will not stop by the end of second pack
9598,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42376,9,This pill changed my life I suffered from such bad cramps before that I would be throwing up nonstop for hours I now barely have to take advil when I get my period my periods only last days too I do not break out no mood swings also I did gain a slight amount of weight but nothing too big Love it Going on year now of being on LoLo
9599,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42429,4,Ive been taking this birth control for weeks and Im realizing I shouldnt have switched but my doctor recommended I changed because Ive been on alysena for years But now on lolo Ive had crazy acne and just got my period a week early and its the most painful cramps Ive ever had I wounldnt recommend this to anyone
9600,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42428,10,I have had the WORST luck with birth control over the years and had to completely go off the pill for almost years because of my extreme anxiety I was experiencing I finally gave lolo a shot and it has been the first pill Ive had zero side effects from except some breast tenderness I would highly recommend this pill for anyone who is extremely sensitive to hormones like myself I have however been on for over months and have not had a period but have been told this is totally fine and not to worry so kind of an added bonus Definitely worth a try
9601,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42427,9,I just finished my first pack and I love it so far Normally I can tell the exact moment when I get my period because it is so painful Its gotten so bad that Ive been close to vomiting from the pain before I have experienced no spotting no reduced sex drive or weight gain so far and the pain is gone I love it
9605,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42421,0,I was on several different BCs from ages and other than bloating and weight gain I dont recall ever having a bad experience I eventually stopped taking it altogether however As of recently age I began taking Lo Loestrin Fe I have never experienced something so horrible from BC in my life I have bled so badly ever since I started it and have experienced the worst and most continual cramps I have tried to push through it in hopes the pain would at least stop but it has just gotten worse I havent experienced mood swings or weight gain as of yet but would take either of those over the type of pain I am experiencing For the record I am petite build and lbs should body size have any merit on experience
9606,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42421,4,Every birth control is going to effect every woman differently I really like Lolo Ive been on it for months now and it is my first type of pill I have taken I used to have an IUD WHICH I DO NOT RECOMMEND In the first few months of taking it I was constantly bloated and I gained about pounds Other than that I love it I used to have a very heavy period that would last days and now with Lolo my period is days long My bleeding is barely anything and my cramps are barely there I love it Highly recommend it
9607,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42421,8,Do not take this pill I am in the hospital because I have a blood clot in my lung The doctor says its from this pill They do list blood clots as one of the side effects
9608,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42421,4,I started lo loestrin in July and found my self becoming very stressed out and depressed all the time I also felt easily angered so I decided to stop taking it My period pains came back and I decided to retry it in December Since then Ive gained pounds and bloat super easy Even when I only eat small meals I also have been getting strong persistent cramps every night Im looking to switch to a different birth control
9609,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42419,3,I LOVE this birth control Ive been on it for roughly months Ive had two experiences with it The first time I had to get off of it because it made me very moody so I switched to different kinds then about a year later I was out back on Lolo again and its been great Ive not had an symptoms besides breast tenderness and headaches occasionally As soon as I got on it my periods went away which worried me at first but my healthcare provider told me I was fine After taking it about months I had very very light bleeding for like two days and then it was done and I havent bled since Its been great for my body and Ive been happy havent faced any mood swings
9611,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42418,2,So far so good Was on depo but it made my anxiety worse and I gained a lot of weight Been on lolo for a month now and no bad side effects except a little irregular spotting Love it
9614,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42413,2,I had two drastically different experiences with this BC The first time was to regulate my periods because I was bleeding for days a month for several months straight Within months it did the job Flash forward years with very normal periods and I got on Lolo for birth control My normal periods went back to bleeding days a month I thought my body just needed to get used to it but after months I had enough It made me so moody that I cried nearly everyday It was my husband who actually suggested I stop taking it because it was affecting our relationship so much Im not sure how or why this experience was so different from the first but its made me scared to try any kind of hormonal birth control again
9615,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42413,2,I hate this BC I already suffered from depression but I feel this made me worse I started tracking my moods and on the rd week of pills I get super aggressive and easily angered Then days before the end of the pill I get extremely anxious Then fall into deep depression that my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse I need to get off of these and I wonder if I can just stop taking it or if I need to wean myself off I dont rec this pill at all
9616,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42413,1,Ive been on LoLo for months now and its been great up until recently At first I loved it because my periods were lighter no cramping no weight gain There were a couple moments of nausea and sore boobs within in the first couple months but thats pretty normal Last month I noticed some breakthrough bleeding which was annoying but not a huge deal This month has been absolute hell I got my period about days before I started my placebos then a week into my new pack I started another period again To top it off about days after that period endedI started bleeding again Needless to say Ill be making an appointment to switch this birth control
9618,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42405,8,I started this birth control in January shortly after I had my son and kept taking it for almost monthsI was loosing hair the entire time but I blamed it on the fact I just had a baby so I kept waiting for it to stop and it didnt Besides that everything was fine up until the th month taking itmy period became irregular I had sex drive and vaginal dryness which was terribleI also gained some weight on this pillover all it didnt work for me but thats not to say it wont work for anyone else
9620,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42403,9,I switched to lolo after being on generic loestrin for about months My body is high estrogen to begin with so I needed something with less hormones Generic gave me terrible anxiety depression mood swings weight gain and hormonal acne After switching to lolo within weeks I had lost lbs had glowing skin and overall felt amazing Every womens body reacts to BC differently so my advice is if you feel awful it definitely couldnt hurt to try something new right Lolo was amazing for me but some people have terrible experiences
9621,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42403,5,My doctor prescribed me to try this pill as my first time in birth control Initially I spotted for a good two weeks and when I did get my period it lasted few days and was into the next month of pills already Side affects Ive noticed though is I have not felt good and as I already suffer from anxiety and depression this made it a million times worse I dont necessarily recommend this pill but thats just from my results of taking it the last two months
9624,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42375,4,This was my first experience with birth control and I hate it This pill made my periods even more irregular than they were prior to taking this pill Ive been on this pill for almost months and not once has my period came on time It is so stressful because I honestly never know when my period is going to come I gained pounds and I have crazy weird dreams overnight
9625,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42374,9,Ive been on this BC for less than a month I love it Im quot lbs and years old I workout days a week and have a normal diet nothing radical Noticed no weight gain with this pill no mood swings no headaches this has improved my skin and is effective in preventing pregnancy just be sure to set an alarm amp take it at the same time each day I take mine at pm before I go to bed If youre hesitating Dont Give this a shot and stick with it youll be happy you did Cheers
9626,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42371,20,Ive been on this pill for years Prior to this pill I had the Implanon in my arm that worked well but I was unsatisfied with occasional irregular bleeding MOST doctors like mine will tell you that there is nothing quotunhealthyquot with not having periods google it and thats what I wanted without getting my tubes tied I skipped the inactive pills and have been doing so since beginning to take it Two years later I couldnt be happier I experienced NO weight gain NO breakouts NO mood swings NO cramps but I never had bad cramps anyway The only way I can even tell Im taking it is because I havent had a period which has been AWESOME Dont let negative reviews scare you away It depends on the person
9627,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42370,1,I was on LoLo for almost months to help with my endometriosis and monthly cramping It caused breast enlargementtenderness anxiety mood swings and spotting for days every month with slight cramping in the middle of the pack Going on my rd month I ended up having heavier bleeding and severe cramping that could not be tamed by NSAIDS Convinced that these were just not the BC pills for me I quit taking the pill after days of bleeding and then bled for an additional days days later I started bleeding again and didnt stop for days I am convinced that these pills just didnt have enough estrogen for my body type
9628,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42368,4,I took this for serious cramps I loved the pill because it made my boobs bigger I gained weight but eventually it went down after the course of months My skin cleared up for about a month then all of a sudden Ive been breaking out for frequently This did NOT help with my cramps at all in fact it probably made it worse My period used to be very heavy had to use super plus tampons but when taking the pill I needed the regular tampon for about days I also only got my period once in the course of the months
9630,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42363,15,This pill overall is not good its been about months that I have been taking this pill and it seems like its a everyday struggle to get out of bed I am finishing these pills after this pack this pill has caused me to hate myself everyone around me and even effect my relationship with my boyfriend Not only am I depressed but my mood swings are not even explainable they are that bad Not having a period is not healthy and feeling like this is not either Probably one of the few people who has lasted past the month period with these pills but I never believed that it was the pills causing me this awful depression but it was never this bad my advice stay away from these pills If you want to stay sane anyway
9632,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42359,11,I was on this birth control for three months I gained over ten pounds and went from a C cup to a DD This pill was absolutely terrible for me I lowered my sex drive and my emotions were so all over the place I considered seeing a therapist Seems like a lot of side effects for such a low dose of hormones Not worth it at all
9633,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42358,7,Worse pills ever Took it for months and never got my period Im not pregnant I always feel sick and exhausted after a long day a lot of headaches and dizziness No sex drive Dont try it
9634,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42358,3,I took lolo for two days It made me feel deeply saddened over things I wouldnt usually be affected by and very easily aggravated However my acne started to look clearer hours after taking it I couldnt take it any longer because of how it made me feel Without birth control I am very moody and prone to irritability and bad moods I wouldnt recommend it for women with my mood type Ive had the best moods with the third and fourth gen bc yaz and nuvaring so it is a shame they are riskier for clots I am and have had a child for reference I find my hormones have changed after giving birth years ago
9635,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42358,9,I hate this pill and I wish I never wouldve tried it I had a cyst on one of my ovaries that ruptured and it caused me to have a period for a month or two straight so my doctor put me on this pill I have gained weight my chin is constantly broken out I had absolutely no sex drive and worst of all my emotions are crazy Its taken a toll on my relationship I cry about the dumbest things I was never like this before I took those pills I quit taking it before I finished the first month because I got to the point to where I hated myself and everyone around me I havent taken it in months and I still have days where I feel miserable and my sex drive has not gotten better yet at all I do not recommend this pill at all It has ruined me
9636,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42358,2,This is the first time I have ever taken birth control This pill has caused my stomach to become very sensitive Almost everything I eat causes horrible stomachache Not only that but do experience bleeding between my periods Im not done my month sample but I will be switching after the months are done
9637,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42354,4,Overall I like this pill It took a few months for my body to get used to it The first months I had random spotting and a period right in the middle of the pack I did gain about lbs but i also havent been eating as well or running as much so that is to be expected My breasts were tender for a few months but thats gone away recently And my periodscramps have gone from unbearable to almost nonexistent so much better The only major major side effect Ive seen is my sex drive go way down and some mood swings But I would rather have these effects than an unwanted pregnancy Give it a shot for at least months before you give up on this ladies It will get better and be worth it in the end
9638,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42353,3,My experience with Lolo was fairly good overall with the exception of one main issue I did not experience any weight gain or irregular break outs and maintained the same sex drive My skin was relatively clear my cramps almost completely disappeared they were very severe before and my period lasted days Im changing to a different pill only because I have started getting my period twice a month My period will sometimes come halfway through the month then again while taking the placebo pills Other times it comes halfway through one month then doesnt come again until the end of the next month Ive enjoyed the lack of unpleasant symptoms but irregularity is a huge pain
9640,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42348,2,This is almost my second month on this pill I am so this is the first bc pill Ive ever taken The doctor suggested it because I did have painful cramps that were regular she said that should disappear However I bled days on the pill the first month Pretty emotional roller coaster nauseas Besides that I havent had any signs of weight gain or acne etc I was terrified at some of the reviews but I havent became pregnant Hopefully I will have a lighter cycle sooner or later so the bleeding could stop If not will try to switch to a different pill
9641,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42346,2,The first three months were horrible I got cyst like acne I had mood swings and I had my period for to weeks at a time Once I got to the th th and th month the acne cleared the mood swings have dramatically decreased i just get teary at sappy things end of month and Ive actually skipped periods My boyfriend encouraged me to stick it through and Im happy I did
9642,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42345,4,Took this pill for about two months then stopped immediately as I saw hives and started losing patches of my hair Im and now Im super self conscious Heading to the Dr tomorrow
9643,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42344,5,I am not a fan of this pill Its the first bc pill I ever took to help with irregular periods and pre menstral migraines Although it did help my migraines a LITTLE my period was worse than it was before and my emotions were going crazy One minute I was laughing the next I was bawling over nothing I was also woken up daily if I turned over in my sleep because my breasts were so sore I took this pill about or months but would not recommend it
9644,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42344,23,The very first day I started on this pill I went looking for reviews To be completely honest I have no idea why I did this because it just scared the crap out of me and made me believe I was going to have some crazy side effects or symptoms I believe most of us go out of our way to write a review when a product is negative therefore we see all the bad From my personal experience this pill was AHMAZING Firstly I was terrified of weight gain I already struggle to keep my weight low and suffer from a slow metabolism I have to workout and eat healthily regularly I have gained no weight Ive had a regular period No break outs and no long lasting spotting No sex drive issues No mood swings I have been completely unaffected y
9645,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42343,4,Absolutely hate it Im on it right now I had the month sample pack from the doctor I went back after the first month because I was bleeding nonstop and wanted to get off of it he convinced me to finish the months to see if it got better IT HASNT terrible cramps bleeding all the time my face broke out and I have like sex drive
9646,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42342,3,I have been trying to lose weight and have not been able too while on it and also sex drive has gone down a lot but other than that no side effects and works well
9647,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42341,2,It was terrible I can relate to so many of these women I tried lo lo for months because I had a hard time with beyaz and I started bleeding and did not stop for months It literally felt like I was getting my period for months straight I became anemic and exhausted all the time I dont know why it had that affect on me Still trying to find a good birth control
9648,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42339,6,I hate this pill I originally switched to LoLo after I noticed that the generic for Notrel Dasetta was giving me slight mood swings Ive been on this pill for months and I am switching back to Dasetta after this week since they do not make Notrel anymore This pill has caused anxiety major mood swings and even mild depression I dont feel like myself at all and have never suffered from depressionmajor mood swings before this pill My husband has even said Ive been acting differently and not like myself I think the biggest issue is that my body goes through the PMS symptoms the last week of the package but my period never arrives and messes up my hormones Hopefully going back to the Dasetta will be better
9649,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42339,5,This was the second BC pill Ive ever been put on and my experience has been amazing once I let my body adjust to the pill At first I experience an almost three week period However now I dont really even get any period and I am asymptomatic I had horrid cramps and really bad PMS PMDD and its all gone now Im so happy
9650,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42338,4,UpdateI am in my third month now taking this BC pill I have only pills remainingI developed acne on my chin during the second month on this pill but it has since gone awayI still have not had a period since September th yet I am now spotting dailyI no longer have any desire for intimacy my sex drive has completely diminishedI have become extremely moody less tolerant and easily angeredI will not be renewing this prescription but will research other products Any advice would be greatly appreciated
9651,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42338,8,Ive been on this birth control one year now and it has been a up and down journey sometimes I would not have a cycle and then I would have a horrible one If youre looking for something to prevent pregnancy this is the one for you I never became pregnant
9652,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42333,7,This was the first birth control I was ever put on due to a scare I hadOverall this was a very good medication however I had one major issue My period would arrive unexpectedly sometimes lasting only a day It began to arrive every other week My doctor wanted me to switch right awayAcne I did break out in the very beginning but after one or two weeks my skin cleared up and stayed beautifulWeight gain noneHeadachesMigraines noneMood swings lightPregnant noOverall I wouldve liked this birth control very much if it didnt destroy my cycle
9653,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42332,4,I got some free samles of Lolo from my womens clinic so I decided to try it I normally take Alesse and have been on a few other different brands in my lifetime A few days after I started taking Lolo I started to bleed I chalked this off as being spotting that some people experience which I have never had before The bleeding did not stop it got worse and my vagina started to become painful and itchy I bled throughout the entirety of the month I was taking Lolo and when I finished my pack of pills I did not continue on another month Within days of stopping taking them I FINALLY stopped bleeding and the discomfort down there went away
9655,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42331,5,I have tried every birth control pill out thereI was reluctant to try loloGlad I did however Its the ONLY pill that didnt give me side effects and I could take in the morning Slight breakthrough bleeding every now and then for the first two months but other than that its the best one yet
9656,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42330,5,I was given packs of Lolo for free from my womens clinic so I decided to try it I normally take Alesse and have been on a few other different brands in my lifetime A few days after I started taking Lolo I started to bleed I chalked this off as being spotting that some people experience which I have never had before The bleeding did not stop it got worse and my vagina started to become painful and itchy I bled throughout the entirety of the month I was taking Lolo and when I finished my pack of pills I did not continue on another month Within days of stopping taking them I FINALLY stopped bleeding and the discomfort down there went away I guess it worked effectively since I was completely unable to have sex while on it
9657,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42330,10,Im Ive been on this pill for about months now and its been terrible I got on this pill because I wouldnt get a period for about or months and when I finally got my period it was super heavy and cramps were unbearable I now get a period every month and they are light last days but I still get intense cramping I also have dark brown spotting every month probably a week after my period and that lasts another week But this month I have been spotting none stop and waking up with cramps everyday Ever since I started it I have also had the worst mood swings crying at everything been pushing my boyfriend away and its been effecting our relationship badly sex drive and severe depression and making my anxiety worse
9660,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42328,8,I love it I went on these for irregular periods bad cramps and to prevent pregnancy My body took a couple months to adjust to it and there was spotting for a couple weeks at a time and breaking out but these are only temporary side effects and around pack or everything was great No periods no babies hardly any pimples no cramps and I didnt gain weight My sex drive is great and energy is as it has always been and my mood is normal as it was before My suggestion to you all is let your body adjust for a few months and only consider the reviews of people who have taken Lo Loestrin Fe for months or more after the side effects have subsided Best of luck
9661,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42323,3,I absolutely hate this pill I started taking this as a treatment for my endometriosis aka cripling cramps and painful sex The first month was horrendous as my period was twice as heavy and twice as long And my cramps were totally intensified So much that it made me cry I was also off the wall emotional and crazy My gyno obviously said to give it months to let it set in So I decided to keep going Its the end of my rd month and Ive literally had periods this month with my current one bringing on just as bad cramps as I experienced without the pill This has done nothing to lessen my cramps and has made me and my menstrual cycle a total mess Also complete loss of libido
9662,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42322,8,This pill is ok in my opinion I didnt gain any weight and it didnt change my acne I have naturally pretty clear skin BUT this made my emotions a complete roller coaster At one point during the day I was on top of the world and the next I was on the verge on crying The biggest problem with this bc is my sex drive Sex is not good anymore and I never had any issues before I started taking this
9664,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42320,10,Ive been taking Lo Loestrin Fe since March of Its now November of and I feel pretty good about it overall I take it at the same exact time every day without failAfter the first two months my period completely stopped During the first months I had almost no sex drive It wasnt until my body got used to the medication that my moods started to stabilize and my sex drive went back to normal I get more emotional and irrational around the end of each pack but thats the only lasting effect this birth control seems to have on meI would recommend Lo Loestrin Fe
9665,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42317,7,I just started taking this pill to stop menstrual migraines Well all I can say I want to get off Im a day bleeder and its been days and Im still bleeding heavy Ive had more headaches and migraines than usual I want to stop but Im going to give it more month hoping that this will all subside Fingers crossed
9666,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42317,7,I have been taking this BC for almost years now I am about and pounds I was put on these pills because I would have a really heavy and painful period so not having my period is really awesome However once I started taking these pills my bra cup size shot up Granted I was when I started taking the pills but I was about a B cup then I was a DD cup within a year Also the first three years I never experienced ANY acne Except for the occasional pimple during exams or when I ate badly I never broke out Now my face breaks out all over and heals about a week before my next period then the cycle starts all over again These were great for a couple years but maybe its time for something new
9668,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42314,14,Initially I read many of these reviews and became horrified at some of the side effects people were listing seemed totally not worth it Dont be turned off or scared by these select few I would recommend this to anyone Being on this bc has not affected or altered my body in any way whatsoever No personalitymood swings of any kind no weight gainbodily changes no acne no migraines or backpain no loss in sex drive etc If anything theres been an increase in my sex drive and Iuve noticed small bumps I may have had on my face clearing easily My pre period symptoms before and during my long and heavy periods were awful Days off school and work since I was nausea fever severe cramping night sweats headaches backpain etc all this is now completely gone Light and short period right at the end of the pack I didnut even notice itus a dream come true No pregnancy despite regular unprotected sex and lighter periods Hopefully it continues to be just as wonderful give it a go people
9669,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42314,7,I have been on daily birth control for about years Recently my doctor told me that Ocella my previous BC was known to cause blood clots in women like me under and she recommended switching She put me on Lo Loestrin Fe about three months ago Ive now had a headache for almost weeks straight most days are so bad that I have to take Excedrin or Ibuprofen Im anxious most of the time not sleeping well and now its gotten to the point where my coworkers and family are noticing So I went to my primary care physician worried that I was depressed and he said I need to get off of this BC and try something new In general Im just really disappointed Ive read a lot of reviews that people do well on Lo Lo but not me
9670,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42311,12,The only good thing that came from being on this pill was that it prevented pregnancy Unfortunately the side effects forced me off it In the beginning there was cystic acne face chestback mild weight gainbloating and mild mood swings I gave it some time my body just needed to adjust After four months the acne cleared up but the mood swings worsened and depression kicked in It only got worse from there Just before stopping this pill at nine months I felt like a completely different person crying over every little thing everything irritated me little sex drive constantly depressed These side effects were having a huge negative impact on my life totally not worth it to me
9671,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42310,9,Im and Ive been on this birth control for about a year and its been nothing short from fantastic The low dose is great I get no noticeable side effects like I did on some of the higher dose generics which were pretty bad I also love not getting periods Ill maybe have one day of light bleeding every once and awhile Highly recommend Lo lo is awesome
9672,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42306,9,I love this birth control Ive just finished my fourth month and I no longer have periods After month one around the time of the two brown inactive pills I only had very light spotting but only one small panty liner for one day was enough Ever since Ive taken this I havent had any cramps or backaches I now have wonderfully clear skin and my boobs actually became a cup size smaller I havent noticed any weight gain and overall there havent been any negative side effects for me I love this prescription its perfect for everything I need it for
9673,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42306,6,Ive decided to stop taking this pill because I have noticed it has effected my personality and how I feel in general Ive became withdrawn sensitive and just sad after about weeks on this pill I noticed a decrease in my sex drive as well Physically I have had no side effects but the psychological side effects mentioned dont seem worth it to me so Im going to try ortho tricyclen lo My sisters take that one and are very happy with it If that doesnt work Im going to switch to a nonhormonal method of birth control
9674,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42279,7,Ive been On it for about almost two months My period was days and it was very light and I didnt have bad cramps Bad part is my period was gone bout a week and I started bleeding again and Im still bleeding over a week now No sex life
9675,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42278,3,Im and on the nd month of this pill and I love it I was taking Minastrin last year and it was horrible Ive had no side effects from lo lo except bigger boobs My period has come on time for the past months and its light although I still have cramping but maybe thatll go away Does its job
9676,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42277,2,I started taking this pill and at first it was okay but its the third week and I get so dizzy and Im so depressed and my headaches are horrible Its supposed to be low hormone but I honestly cant tell Im going off of this pill today
9677,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42275,4,I have been on this BC for almost month In the time since I started it I have gained weight have had headaches every day acne on my face and chest have never had an issue before and my sex drive has literally become nonexistent I am not happy with this pill and will be going off of it and back to condoms Not worth it for me to have these side effects
9678,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42275,7,NOT a fan Ive only been using Lolo for about a month now and Im ready to stop Before using Lolo Ive already had an eating disorder depression and anxiety and now after using it every single one of them is times worse Ive gained a bit of weight already while still eating very little which when having an eating disorder is more frustrating than you will ever know Also in the last few days Ive have zero motivation to do anything Ive been constantly tired and Ive been sadmoodyemotional and crying a lot more I just had my third breakdown in days which is uncommon for me as I normally dont cry very oftenAND Im getting acne on my face chest and back which I havent had a problem with in over years Not happy
9679,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42274,3,Im quot lbs yrold on BC since I was Originally on Yaz then BeYaz but realized after stopping BC all together that it was causing me to have ongoing nausea tiredness and fluid retention issues so Dr mentioned I might have estrogen sensitivity I didnt experience any side effects in the first month of taking this BC at all my mood was better period was light and I was able to lose almost lbs was at lbs following the same diet amp exercise plan I had been on while on BeYaz However by the second month I began experiencing horrible stomach cramps to the point where I was unable to move and would eventually throw up from the pain Once I stopped taking this BC stomach pains disappeared
9680,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42272,3,This pill gave me very strange side effects For one the first few weeks I had a headache every single day I had no sex drive and my period last days
9681,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42270,6,I was worried about going on birth control but I have been on this for half a year now I have had NO side effects weight gain mood swings breakouts and didnt feel different at all I have a little spotting about once a month Definitely happy with this pill
9682,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42270,2,Im on this birth control about months I gained about lbs already and my weight keep growing My diet is still healthy and low on carbs my physical activity is normal I didnt experience significant increase of appetite but I suspect it affects metabolism My previous pill was ok I managed to lose some weight due to lower appetite but this one apparently not the same I also had some unexpected minor bleeding in the middle of a cycle My skin got slightly better and no mood swings but uncontrollable weight grow is scary
9683,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42269,2,Terrible experience Pills caused me to have anxiety at work but worst of all I had pain and pressure on my chest This medication is known for causing pulmonary embolism so as soon as I started feeling the pain on my chest area I immediately stopped taking it I asked my OB about my symptoms and he pretty much told me that this medication wouldnt cause pulmonary embolism even though it is known to do such a thing I listened to my body and everything went away soon after quitting
9684,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42269,6,I have been on Lo Loestrin for almost months and was extremely nervous since the last birth control I had been on did not work at all Lo Loestrin has been absolutely great for me I weigh and am years old I have experienced NO mood swings heavy bleeding head aches nausea or vomitting I would definitely recommend anyone to give this birth control a shot
9686,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42263,2,Ive been on this medication for about months I know they say it takes a while to kick in but I have been having a lot of breakthrough bleeding Then when the end of the month comes I barely have a period I also gained pounds and have been working out and eating like I always have I was on trisprintec for years and it worked great until I started getting headaches and breaking out I then switched to orthotricyline low and I was spitting I changed to this and I do not like it at all Everyones body works differently but I just want to find something that works for me
9687,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42262,4,I was on this pill for about a year I worked completely fine for me Although I did have bloating and at first had major mood swings and would often get depressed Wanted to try something new and I honestly I like Lo Loestrin Fe over any other birth control
9688,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42261,6,I love the LoLoestrin FE It is the best BC Ive ever tried No periods no mood swings migraines are gone day periods are gone The only thing I dont like is the slight weight gain But its worth it to me to feel so much better
9689,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42261,6,This birth control worked effectively to act as a birth control BUT The side effects suck so bad Ive been on this birth control for years probably closer to now and Ive been having breakthrough bleeding for nearly the whole time Ive been on it after year Imagine this getting double periods every month or periods that last for like half the month Thats what Ive been going through for well over a year I didnt want to switch over because I thought it would stop and my body was already used to this medication but finally I couldnt take it anymore I would get EXTREMELY moody and depressed during the multiple periods Imagine being angry and tired and sore half the month every month for over a year Im now
9691,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42259,4,I needed help with my painful period thats Ive had almost all my life and my doctor recommended me a low dosage pill which happened to be this one I was constantly having breakthrough bleeding that would last weeks gained weight like crazy and really depressed I had to get off it I wouldnt recommend this to anyone
9693,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42258,12,I was never able to take quotthe pillquot due to side effects of nausea headaches and other issues I am years old and my gynecologist said to try this one and see and I knew right when I started it that I was not having any issues at all I do not feel sick or have any headaches I do not have problem with my a sex drive and my weight is the same I have been on it for about years now I am very happy that this one came out and for me it has been great I know everyone reacts differently
9694,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42257,7,Horrible experience Im only on my nd month as I have promised my Dr id keep trying it I have had major depressionanxiety since Ive started this pill My sensitivity has shot way up as so has my weight Still have cramping which is why I started this pill in the first place I have barely touched my boyfriend since taking this pill I went from having sex almost every day to having sex drive To the point where my boyfriend questioned my fidelity I stop taking it today Id rather put up with the bad periodscramps than go through this
9697,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42255,19,Negative side effects Weight gain Im very petite amp I workout at least times a week I track my activity using a Fitbit amp while taking this BC my activity was actually higher than the previous month That being said I still gained about pounds My appetite increased but not enough to justify this weight gain By my calculations I should have been losing weight due to higher activity levels Additionally the eight gain only occurred around my mid section amp felt bloated and uncomfortable Mood Swings I rarely cry and when I do its for good reason With this BC I wanted to cry over everything Acne My skin was clear before taking this amp now I have cystic acne all over my forehead and cheeks
9699,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42305,8,I am writing to share my experience The pill worked great for me in the period and mood sense but I developed a chronic cough The doctors kept telling me it was unrelated and I began taking all kinds of allergy meds which did little to help Then inhalers which helped but caused other issues This went on for years I now am off the pill and the cough has stopped I cant believe no one else has ever had this problem
9700,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42303,8,Ive been on this pill for a year now Im really happy with it I tried a few other pills before marvalon seasonale which made me super emotional The only pill that used to work for me was Diane Once I read about some bad studies on Diane it was time to switch and my Dr recommended LOLO The first two months I had my period normalheavy Ever since I dont get my period The good thing for me is that I still get a bit of bloatingweight gain and a teensy bit emotional around when I would get my period This way I can kind of tell my body is still in a cycle without all the hassle of a period as weird as that seems I know these things arent monthround so theyre pretty easy to put up with No major weight gain otherwise
9701,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42303,9,I was on Lo Loestrin Fe for months I took this medication because I had extremely painful periods I was practically bedridden for days every month While the medication did help my pain go away I bled A LOT My period itself was days longer than usual and I spotted for a week and a half before having another fullsize period It was ridiculous My doctor kept telling me quotSpotting is normal Spotting will go away It should stop soonquot But Im telling you it was a lot of blood I could constantly feel myself bleeding and it often times came out in clots Not worth it in the end for me
9702,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42301,1,I have no problems with the medicine I have been using it approximately months Only note nausea and upset stomach the first month of starting but already passed that and a bit blurry sightCompared with other drugs such as Lupron it is very good and no increased weight
9703,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42299,5,Love this BC I had tried a few when i was younger that made me gain weight and very emotional I stopped taking BC after that for years Well my periods were so bad that i knew i needed to try BC again to see if that would help I LOVE THIS the first few months while my body was adjusting i was lightly bleed for a few weeks at a time nothing more than a panty liner it was annoying but i did figure that my body was just adjusting Now i have been on the pill for months i get a light period panty liner only for days and thats it I have no side effects i think i lost some weight because it helps my emotional PMS so i dont eat as much right before my period I dont have emotional side effects I FEEL better overall i am so happy
9704,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42298,14,I want this review to influence anyone whos considering birth control to STEER CLEAR I am very upset amp frustrated but I will try to refrain from using profanities hopefully to make the point more effective I have suffered from heavy painful periods ever since I started it when I was I am now seventeen I dealt with being sick days a month After conducting some research amp asking around many people advised birth control was the way to go I finally gathered up the courage amp collected my nerves amp went to the doctor for a solution At sixteen a magic pill that made everything about your period better seemed like a pretty sweet deal to me I didnt even hesitate to grab the trial sample from my doctors hand I was excited to be rid of what was a seemingly huge issue at the time The first month was absolute hell I cried at the drop of a hat the entire month I got extremely depressed amp anxious I bled basically the whole second amp third month I read that it was all normal I was fed up but there was still that small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel promising painless light short periods I stuck it out five whole months In this short time I have experienced a plethora of awful side effects I have acne now which rarely occurred in the past This is not your run of the mill acne They are all over my chin amp forehead They are rooted so deep you cant squeeze them hard enough to save your life They take a month to go awaydry up just to reoccur in little time I have lost a lot of my hair I now have a bald spot I guess its more of a receding hairline Please know that I am SEVENTEEN Ive dealt with excess anxiety way beyond what is normal crazy mood swings constant bleeding headaches that would last for a WEEK amp the list goes on The biggest thing for me is that I am having short term memory issues I am positive that this is another lovely side effect that can be attributed to this pillHad I known that these things could happen I never would have started taking this medication This Dr had failed to inform me of all of these things I was naive amp I was sixteen All she told me was that my quotbreasts amp stomach may hurtquot while I am adjusting That is bullshit I do not trust quotmedical professionalsquot anymore Please do not take this medication or any other birth control medications Do your own research amp dont just take your doctors word
9705,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42297,3,Ive been in this BC since late Aug I sadly had to have with a medical abortion months in due to health problems I started another BC days after my procedure but I wanted to switch back to my old BC lo lo when I finished the st pack of the other BC Ive had periods and the only BC related side affect has been tender breasts which has only started recently I was nervous I may be pregnant again I am still recovering from the damage and severe weight loss caused by the pregnancy but she reassured me it is normal to not have periods She said during the procedure they scraped my uterus lining clean so I started with no lining amp the BC didnt have to break anything down I have been emotional but Im happy w the progress
9706,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42296,10,Im years old and Ive been taking LoLo for about years now It was the first birth control pill I ever tried and Ive had such a good experience with it For reference I am quot and a healthy weight without significant medicalpsych history During the first month or two of starting the pill my only side effect was breakthrough bleeding which subsided I havent had any weight changes or mood changes while on this medication My favorite part about LoLo is that its lowdose and that my periods are VERY light sometimes I will go a couple of months without even having one that might not be ideal for some people but I personally like it Try it out
9707,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42293,12,So its been three months on this birth control and Im insanely happy I read a lot of reviews and I was afraid of the side effects but so far I havent noticed anything off The first month was awful because I was bleeding every day I almost decided to stop taking it but my doctor assured me everything would sort out after the first month and she was right My periods are almost non existent no cramps or bloating either My skin is looking better than ever I havent gained any weight in fact Im down pounds from when I started Weight gain was my biggest fear but I have been eating healthy and hardly doing any workouts with no problems So I would definitely recommend this method of birth control
9708,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42292,8,I have been on LOLO canadian version for just over a month now I personally have had side effects on this pill but nothing extreme and I feel pretty good Heres a list of my side effects week by weekWeek dry eyes dull cramps vivid dreams feeling tiredWeek Small dark spotting irritable acne large appetite tiredWeek large appetite acne emotional dark spottingWeek dark spotting tired dull cramps appetite normalDid not get my period on the placebo pills Spotting was no big deal at all No weight gain No bloating No horrendous cramps that I usually get So far during the second pack I am feeling pretty good I think this pill is worth a try and you need to give your body time to adjust
9709,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42290,5,I have tried probably over birth control pills since I have a health condition that makes it a bit harder for me to be on higher dose bcps I was on Errin for months and was bleeding nonstop so my doctor changed me to Lo Loestrin Fe I have been on it for exactly month and I wish I would have never touched this medicine In month I have gained lbs I am extremely emotional I broke down crying watching a cooking show for goodness sake constant heart burn bad headaches every other day cant sleep I am thirsty constantlythe list goes on To me the side effects are not worth it
9710,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42289,5,I took this pill for almost month Ive tried other BCs but never had more bad side effects than I do on this pill I was extremely nauseous light headed dizzy unmotivated VERY tired irritable I would black out daily I started breaking out never had acne before also it messed w my vision When trying to focus on something like reading or writing my eyes would strobe in and out of vision and shake uncontrollably it would last about seconds and come about every minutes I am years old and used to weigh about after starting this pill I lost pounds which left me feeling weak and looking terrible Headaches are bad too Ive never had health issues but this really messed me up I do NOT recommend
9711,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42288,8,So far so good Began taking this in April First days I had my period but towards the end it was brownish discharge Missed my period in May had it in June for days extremely light and havent had it since Ive been on many BCs from pills to Depo and by far this has been the best for me No anxiety or depression exacerbation which was a big worry since I already have them didnt want this to make it worse Still have my sex drive which the hubby was worried about Only other symptoms Ive had are sore breasts hunger and even though no period I still have PMS before my sugar pills
9712,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42288,9,So far no complaints I just started month of being on this pill The first month was strange A lot of breakthrough bleeding but it wasnt terrible Month two was a lot better Sex drive is about the same if not BETTER My periods are so light and almost none existent I havent noticed any type of weight gain with this pill My mood hasnt changed much occasionally Ill be emotional but it happens Everyone is different and this may not be for everyone For me this pill works and i love it
9713,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42288,5,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER this BC gave me SEVERE depression and made me the saddest i have ever been in my life definitely is not worth it for me i have stopped taking this pill it made me so overly sensitive to where i cry over the smallest things and it hard to not cry in public i cried every day after two weeks of taking this pill
9714,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42286,8,I am years old and have been on this pill for about a year and a half I rarely have periods my last one was about months ago and when I do have a period it is super light and only lasts about days I havent experienced any cramping mood swings intermittent bleeding etc while on the pill The biggest downside is definitely the effect on my sex driveit is nonexistent since switching to this pill
9715,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42286,3,I originally went on this pill because I had bad acne and my doctor suggested LoLo because of my age This is the only birth control Ive taken On my first two months my periods were a little off because it still needed to kick in but after that I had very light periods and only slight cramping and my skin did clear up a little Im near the end of my th package now but this week Ive been extremely emotional crying for no reason but it seems that everyone else is having that side effect too Overall I think its a pretty good pill
9716,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42286,1,Im a year old healthy woman I just gave birth a little over a month ago I decided to give this birth control a shot since every other birth control Ive tried was too strong and caused me to have migraines Well SILLY me for doing so Ive literally taken only five pills so far and I feel like a complete psycho Ive had terrible mood swings cry at the drop of a pen overly sensitive Ive CRAMPED every single day and have had brown spotting like my periods coming since I started the pill and loss of appetite I didnt even feel like this while pregnant at all This is the worst birth control Ive personally ever had and Will not be taking anymore pills for my own sanity lol I do though hope it works for everyone else
9717,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42283,10,I am years old and have been on Lo Loestrin Fe for about years now My Dr suggested to put me on this bc because the other birth control I was on was giving me severe mood swings The thing I love about this bc is that I dont have my period AT ALL not even once The downside to this bc is that at the end of my pack I start to have a few days of mood swings depression anxiety and I get overly sensitive about stuff Also I gained a bunch of weight from taking this pill before taking the pill I was lbs and now I am about lbs and im quot The other good side to the pill is that it stopped the cramping immediately I wanna go off the pill but I am scared of the side effects of coming off it
9719,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42283,3,I was prescribed this medication last Monday Immediately I was experiencing side effect I noticed that my sex drive decreased tremendously In addition I would nausea throughout the day Within the first few days I was spotting lightly then by day I was HEAVILY bleeding It required me to wear a tampon My breast were super tender I couldnt wear regular bras no longer so I switched to sport bras By week two I was experiencing acnemy skin has always been clear due to my regular skin routine and vitamins The worst side effect of all I had depression I was noticing I was upset for the smallest things from my kids misbehaving to my boyfriend stating a fact about something
9721,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42280,1,After starting the pill my breasts got really sore and my periods were no where for months After that my breasts got notably bigger almost a cup but after taking it for around months my periods are still irregular which is really annoying I had hoped that taking lo loestrin would help with my cramps and back pain but they are the same as before For months my cycle would be days then days and they would still be full day periods I havent noticed any other side effects No complaints
9722,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42279,7,Love this BC I dont experience any side effects like migraines or weight gain or anxiety Also I no longer get my periods Been on this BC for years so far
9727,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42246,10,I am years old and I was put on this birth control because I have extremely heavy periods Im going on my rd month of this birth control and Ive had very little negative side effects I lost weight and am continuing to lose weight Ive lost about pounds right now on this Ive had a decreased appetite and Ive noticed Im full sooner I didnt have any mood swings or nausea My acne cleared up majorly and my face is completely clear now I had moderate cystic acne and now its completely gone The only negative side effect for me is Ive had breakthrough bleeding for about days so my gyno wants to switch me I cant say anything about the effectiveness as a birth control as Im not sexually active I recommend
9728,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42246,3,Im not really sure how I feel about this pill yet I started it two Thursdays ago the first day of my period and my period immediately went away Last Thursday I got my period again this time full on with cramps and everything So far today is day so Ill wait more days before calling the gynie I havent had any mood swings or depression but Im on this to NOT have a period and so far its not doing what I really wanted it to do
9729,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42244,5,I went on this BC because I loved the loestrin FE which is apparently no longer available and I thought this would be similar It IS NOT at all similar I feel completely different on this pill and Ive given it months My side effects include constant cramps and abdominal pain complete loss of sex drive diaherra and depression I began to push my boyfriend away and am still very very attracted to him yet I have no sex drive This pill has completely changed me and it took me months to realize it My periods were light but if I missed one day of taking the pill I would start spotting Beware and watch for how your body reacts to this pill
9730,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42244,4,I was on this for almost years It worked great my periods were really heavy and I had a lot of cramping but when I started taking this I had little to no period and no cramping But this past year Ive realized it has made me very moody It and some other factors broke up my engagement because I was so moody and just a nightmare to be around sometimes It made me bipolar I stopped taking it a month ago and my boyfriend says he can notice a difference in my mood Now Im back to heavy periods and lots of cramping It feels like I have to choose between my relationship and my BC My insurance paid for some of this but I still had to pay a month But I would call my Dr and they would give me a discount card and samples
9731,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42243,3,I really like this birth control I was on depo which was awful so I changed to lo loestrin fe its been months now I have had a huge appetite increase I want to eat everything I was and now I am Ive become a big cry baby but as long as I dont have a child I am good I know every birth control has some side affects so I dont mind Ill stick with this one
9732,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42243,4,I switched to Lo Loestrin about a year ago I didnt start to realize until after I was off of birth control for months and started again what this BC did to me I gained weight in only specific area like lower stomach and chest blew up immediately after my first pack Mind you my diet or exercise did not change but my body did I also was bloated for weeks at a time before and after my inactive pills Over all Lo Loestrin did its job for me but I am on a search for a BC thats more healthy for my body
9733,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42242,8,I was on Lo Loestrin Fe for years Overall good experience Not pregnant and never have been while on this medication I took it every morning around the same time weekends within hours of my usual time I did not consistently have a period each month which is normal for this medication Sometimes I had the usual cramps and mood swings around the time I was suppose to have my period but no bleeding Had breast tenderness I did not gain weight No issues with acne but I have a very strong regime for that due to the type of skin I have I would recommend to women starting birth control for the first time I needed a higher dosage of estrogen due to breakthrough bleeding twice so now I am on Junel no complaints so far
9734,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42242,6,I am years old and on my third pack possibly fourth I cant remember for sure of this birth control The first two months were great I didnt notice any side effects and my period was normal This past month though Ive started to notice a lot of nausea and some headaches Most recently my depression and anxiety have increased tenfold and gone through the roof I cant stop crying over everything and Im a mess all the time Its time to stop this BC because its just making my life a living Hell
9735,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42241,2,Started the pills and was excited because I needed help with regularity and cramps I ended up getting hormonal cysts that were so painful One was almost as big as a dime on my chin and we had to push it out yuck My lips on my face also swelled up Funny but not really I was switched onto another pill mainly because of the lips swelling
9737,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42239,3,As soon as I started this birth control I became very nauseous and bloated I also became extremely hormonal and began flirting with every guy I saw I got a lot of side effects as well stinging eyes extra sensitive skin mood swings soreness etc As far as periods gothis still gave me a period and I ended up having brown spotting gross back pain and cramps It also lasted longer than my regular one usually would This BC pill will not help with your acne as it tends to give you MORE hormones than less I know youve probably heard that your dermatologist say you should give a pill months but in my experience it should start working immediately just my advice
9739,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42238,1,Im years old and Ive been on Lolo for over a year now The first few months were great very little cramping and light bleeding periods only lasted about days But in the past few months k have noticed my periods have been scarce and extremely light I havent had a normal period since January Part of this is due to the fact that I had brain surgery at the end of January but by now I should be having normal periods My period is about a month late now I am not pregnant either
9740,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42238,4,I love it I had irregular periods that lasted up to days and my gynecologist put me on this pill And I noticed a difference right away My periods were back to normal I had no side effects whatsoever when taking this pill The main reason I love this pill because no more periods I barely have spotting I love it Lol
9741,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42238,5,Ive been on this pill for over a month now Im on my second week of my second package During the first month of taking this pill I kept spotting for about weeks until my actual period came And the blood would sometimes be dark brown too so I was definitely worried and called my doctor but she said its my body getting used to the pills since its the first bc Ive ever taken Im btw Also in the beginning of taking the pill I had very bad acne breakout but towards the end of the month my acne began to clear up Right now I have almost no acne and just tiny blemishes Pretty amazing to me since Ive always had acne problems As for the spotting I no longer am getting it so thats good So Im gonna stick around for this pill
9743,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42235,3,This is the best oral contraceptive Ive been on thus far In the past years I have been on tricyclen lo Alesse for years and Diane This is the first contraceptive where I have felt like myself No side effects no breakthrough bleeding as long as I take it the same time everyday and only two day periods This is such a miracle to the oc industry I recommend it to every female I know You cant go wrong with the lowest side effects on the market Although Alesse is a house hold name it has some of the highest side effects on the market and I never quite felt like myself on it
9744,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42235,1,Tried this out because I wanted a lower dose birth control pill I was on it for months and I got two periods a month PLUS breakthrough bleeding worsened acne that only went away on the break as well as bad mood swings I would cry every few days for no reason Im switching to Diane for my cystic acne which loestrin fe made worse The only positive was that Lolo controlled my primary dysmenorrhea
9746,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42233,13,I have been on this pill for years Side effects experienced lasted about months and then everything went back to normal This included going from a C cup to D cup Eventually went back down to C Did NOT experience weight gain in other areas except chest Breakouts pretty bad in first months but calmed down after my body got used to it Id recommend doing facials during this beginning period to calm the skin I still get occasional breakouts but nothing like the nightmare stories reading on the reviews Id suggest sticking through it for at least months before you throw in the towel Your body is going to react to new hormones entering your body I get my period sometimes not at all and sometimes days
9747,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42233,3,My experience with this BC started out well but quickly took a horrible turn I had been on it a few years ago and experienced moods swings so I stopped taking it I started again about months ago While I had no period crapping or acneit caused me to be more anxious than I ever had been I have barely slept in days I feel extremely depressed and have a negative outlook on life This BC ruined me nausea leg pain anxiety and depression Please be careful if you have a history of anxiety or depression taking this The mood swings just arent worth it Losing my sex drive and have been pulling away from my boyfriend I would definitely not recommend this BC to anyone even someone I hated lol
9749,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42230,5,I have only been on this pill for week and I feel as if Im not even on bc at all I feel no change which is welcome after dealing with ortho tri cyclen lo for several years With that pill if I missed a pill or started later than a week after the last set of pills it made me feel like crap This pill I havent felt anything since starting it And thats awesome
9753,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42225,2,Worst Acne Breakouts I started this birth control a month ago and my face started breaking out the first week At first I didnt really think it was the birth control until weeks later when the acne got even worse I contacted my doctor and havent used the birth control for over a week now and my face is still breaking out Hopefully my face will begin to clear up in a couple of weeks once the birth control is completely out of my system
9755,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42219,3,Took only one month to figure out this medication is the worst Poor body image issues depression worsened bloatinginstant weight gain feeling horrible cystic acne that Retin A could not even treat horrid BC pill
9756,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42215,11,This is the only birth control Ive been on and Im sticking to it because it works really great for me The first three months or so I had no sex drive but it passed so it wasnt a permanent side effect Its been at least seven months now and I get hardly any cramps whereas before I used to get them so bad that Id fall on the floor in pain Hardly any period lasts about three days and I can use liners for two days regular sized pad for one day whereas before I had a really awful heavy seveneight day period I also have really clear skin now too Ill get maybe two tiny pimples in total nearing my period and thats it Its fantastic And of course its also done its job as a birth control pill
9757,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42214,3,Im and i started this pill exactly a month ago Im about to start my nd pack this evening I bled all month long and with the last pills I didnt even spot or cramp So I am a little concerned I am definitely going to take a test before I start this new pack but other than the bleeding that has now stopped I have notice my skin is MUCH better I used to break out on my face chest and back and now its barely noticeable I reluctantly got on the pill because of very painful ovairian cysts I do feel pain here and there but NOTHING like I had before When I was I got on the nuvaring and was on that awful thing for years I got off it and lost pounds and Im a petite person But other then the spotting I love it
9758,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42213,0,this was the first form of birth control pill that I have ever taken and it was horrible I had constant bleeding my period was a mess I had constant mood swings and it would be extremely hard for me to get wet during sex I would also get really dry at times while having sex with my partner This drug is ask terribly over priced my insurance was no longer coveri it and I had to pay out of my pocket for one month After months of being on the drug I asked my doctor if I could change to another one and ever since then this new birth control has been amazing
9759,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42213,3,I started this pill when my son was months old he is now months old About months ago I stopped taking the pill and months later I started it again I had never had any problems with the pill before this but after stoppingstarting the pill my hair started falling out I have been to my OBGYN about it who has taken me off of the pill to my primary care physician and to a dermatologist All doctors say there really isnt anything they can do about the hair loss Its been about months of hair loss and I am to the point my husband last night noticed my hair line is receding and Ive lost about of my hair I am devastated embarrassed and scared I have read devastating hair loss can happen with this pill
9760,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42212,4,I took this pill for two months The first month was amazing No spotting my period was only two days on the exact date it was supposed to be on When the second month started it was horrible Mood swings uncontrollable bleeding cystic acne no sex drive I stopped taking the pill after two weeks into the second month Acne cleared up bleeding stopped I wouldnt recommend this pill
9761,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42210,5,Ive been on this pill for three months now and I like it a lot This is my first time ever being on bc and Im so I was looking for something simple and easy to handle and this pill was definitely good for me I didnt get my period the first month and the only side effects I get are sore boobs cramping during the same time every month and minor mood swings The only negative aspect that I didnt like was that I had spotting in between periods on the third pack the one Im on now which made me nervous since I didnt get that the first two months Other than that I would highly recommend it
9764,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42207,5,Ive been on this medication for about months now I really love it The first period i had on this pill was pretty rough Like crazy heavy with lots of clotstissue But that was a one time thing Then I would spot for two weeks at a time and that got annoying But Now my periods are very light and last only a few days but still with same period symptoms So far no weight gain at all but my breasts have gotten huge I was an A cup and now Im a C My skin is also very clear I dont really have any complaints
9766,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42203,4,I was on Lo Loestrin Fe for months during that time my hair started falling off dramaticallyI didnt get pregnant so it served its purpose but I had to stop taking it because I was literally going bald I noticed hair loss is not noted as a side effect but its been month since i stopped taking Lo Loestrin Fe and my hair has been growing back and it hasnt been falling off anymore
9767,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42203,2,Ive been using this bc for a year now The first month I was on it I didnt notice a change at all but the second month was torture I had my period for weeks straight mood swings headaches dizziness etc I was told to just wait it out until the rd month ended to see how it went so I did The rd month was much better and by the th month my periods only lasted days with very light bleeding The reason I got on this was for really heavy bleeding so this pill was a blessing Everything has pretty much been good since then No acne and I didnt experience any weight gain until the th month but thats because Im not really eating correctly I still experience mood swings and I have a lack of energy but overall its great
9768,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42202,4,I went on Lolo primarily for extreme period pain and it works great Ive tried lots of different kinds of birth control and Im the happiest with Lolo because the side effects are barely there I had nauseau for the first days only and I havent gained lots of weight like on other ones but I have gained a cup size I had a bit of spotting the first month and had to use liners but that went away Ive had really minor mood swings definitely not as bad as Marvelon I cried over everything Overall Im really pleased with this pill
9770,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42195,4,This is the only birth control Ive ever been on and Ive been on this pill for almost months and it is so great No periods no cramps very little acne at the very end and beginning of packs but that is about the only negative thing I got an antibiotic shot today and I guess this medicine doesnt mix with that shot because Ive felt sick ever since I took my pill tonight So beware when youre on antibiotics and taking this pill its a little icky feeling Other wise I recommend this to everyone who is just starting on birth control
9771,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42193,11,I was on this for about years At first I had periods they stopped within months which my doctor said was completely normal and Ill agree I was a little moody at times around when my period should have come But other than that I actually lost weight on this pill I did exercise every now and then I got off this pill because I was really concerned with not having a period I got on Sprintec and HATED it I gained pounds Im a very petite person so this was totally noticeable I love Lo Loestrin I will never try another birth control If youre looking for something just to manage your period with no side effects this is the one AND I got it for free every month talk about amazing
9774,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42192,6,Ive been taking lo loestrin fe for about two years now I havent had any horror stories with it but I am switching For the positive side I never get my period and I havent gainedlost weight On the negative side I constantly have unbearable headaches and I have absolutely no sex drive
9775,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42188,2,My dr decided to switch me to this bc just to try a different kind because I had a headache every period Well took this pill for days I felt awful I woke up feeling hungover every morning headaches dizziness Almost fainted at work So I called my Dr and switched right back to my previous bc And its been over months since this and Ive lost a lot of hair and I mean a lot
9776,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42188,1,Ive been on lolo for months now Its finally time I give my review The first months I had very light periods then after I just didnt have any periods As we speak my breasts started to be tender This is the first time in months Also I get yeast infection like every month I am super dry down there even with foreplay My sex drive is gone through the window I do not have anymore mood swings so thats a plus Im taking an appointment to change my bc I tried jasmin alesse IUD copper marvelon the patch So yeah Ive been around and tried them all Maybe it just wasnt for me
9778,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42182,11,I got this medicine in early January it is now almost July I LOVE IT I am a migraine sufferer and have seizures it was super hard to get me a birth control that I like Ive tried other types I wasnt allowed to have certain types due to the seizures so they were limited I didnt hear about Lo Loestrin Fe until I made my first appointment with an GYN Now that Im on it no sore boobs no moodiness no weight gain no acne I got my period for the first time today which is why I was researching if that happened to anybody else but its really light and seems like nothing to worry about So I would definitely recommend for anybody like me
9779,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42180,2,Ive been on Lo Loestrin Fe for treatment of Endometriosis and Adenomyosis for going on months and I have to say that I am very happy with this pill After the nightmare experience with my last pill Seasonique severe depression constant bleeding upset stomach zero libido this pill is a Godsend The first month was admittedly rough as it normally is when switching birth control pills I had massive mood swings and week of spotting But since then it has been smooth sailing The only issue I have is low libido Im guessing Id probably have that problem with any hormonal pill so Im making the best of it But Lo Loestrin Fe helps keep me pain free and has the added bonus of no bleeding A so far
9780,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,42179,2,My experience on this BC has been horrible I bleed very heavily before I get on placebo pills Horrible cramping hot flashes mood swings I got on this pill to make my periods lighter but this pill made them x worst Definatley switching
9781,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42178,4,Ive been on Lo Loestrin Fe for months now for birth control and heavy periods It first took a little bit to regulate and so the second month my period was two weeks long but it was extremely light I went from bleeding for days straight through tampons and pads every few hours to being able to wear a pantiliner and change it mid day without worrying about bleeding through My periods only last days now and I have little cramping I have experienced mood swings the first week I start a new month of medication and my boobs have increased in size and one is slightly larger than the other I have had some cramping throughout the month and missed my period the th month I was scared I was pregnant but other women have experienced the same issue Ive had few issues
9783,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42169,0,Best I ever had
9784,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42168,12,I was prescribed this birth control bc of my ovary cyst Ive had unprotected sex after the birth control amp Ive not gotten my period Im actually a week late Not really worried bc I took a pregnancy test at the hospital days before my period was due amp it came out negative A lot of reviews says they never got their period so that gives me hope Besides that my breast have grew amp are very sore amp I have bad acne On top of that Ive been eating A LOT I havent spotted but have had unusual brown discharge Symptoms are really weird
9785,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42161,14,I have never been on birth control before Ive only hear about terrifying stories from my friends on how birth control makes them fat and get pimples So I was a little afraid to get on the pill but I knew I needed it I explained to my doctor my worries so she then prescribed me Lo loestrin Fe I have been on this pill for months now and the only side affect I have experienced is being short tempered Other than that this pill is amazing My face is clear of blemishes I dont get my period and if I do it only last for days and hardly anything comes out This is coming from someone who couldnt go on with everyday activities when I used to get my period This pill is great and Id definitely recommend it
9786,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42160,60,Former BC pill hater here Other brands gave me massive mood swings On Yaz and Apri I was basically Jason Voorhees Swore Id never take BC again but now in my s irregular periods and recurrent ovarian cysts forced my hand Bottom line I LOVE this pill Cons Sensitive breasts Pros Greatly improved mood I feel like Im always having a good day NO mood swings Minimal cramps light periods fuller breasts skin is great cant stay away from my husband and condoms are out of here Doesnt get better than thisIf youre on the fence or sensitive to hormones like me this may be your good stuff Im glad I didnt listen to anyone else and just tried it for myself
9788,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42157,15,Ive been taking this bc for a few years now Other pills made me really sick so I was excited to find a pill that worked My boobs got ginormous one more than the other haha but that goes away after a while When I started I would always get my period in the middle of the pack I tried stopping the pills and restarting to get the period at the right time but nope it stayed in the middle I do have to say it was really really light and maybe two days max No cramping whatsoever I was such a happy camper bc without bc Id feel like I was gonna pass out from the pain So after a year or so my periods completely stopped That was alarming at first and I kept taking tests too make sure I wasnt pregnant I dont worry any more
9789,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42156,8,Been on this for months First month I had a little neausea and I got my period twice in the first weeks each time lasting about days After that it went straight to a normal cycle I went from soaking through pads a day on my heaviest days to just some brown discharge No weight gain but Im having a little harder time taking weight off maybe in mh head Sex drive is down a little but its a small price to pay to not act like a crazy woman Even my husband says he cant believe the difference in my moods In a good way My face cleared up and minimal period Working wonders for me
9790,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42153,4,The only thing I have to complain about is that Ive had breakthrough bleeding since the very first month which my doctor told me is a sign that I need a higher hormone count which is why shes switching me to the generic version of Minastrin Fe Junel Fe to see if it helps What I did like about Lo Loestrin Fe is that it eventually turned my periods from mediumheavy days to about fairly light days
9792,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42150,6,I totally hate this Birth Control I have had so many symptomsside effects First I had extreme stiffness in my neck Then extreme bloating in my lower stomach I am constantly constipated and my stool is extremely hard I have extreme shortness of breath that comes and goes I went from having a normal cycle for days to maybe having a day cycle To me I feel like that is not good and feel like my body is not getting the cleanse it needs My boobs are HUGE and painful My husband cant even touch on them without me getting extremely irritated I am constantly tired and we have no sex life anymore I have no sex drive And now I have been bleeding for over a week and now even on my th week I am done with this
9793,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42149,10,I just started my third pack of Lo Loestrin Fe and so far I like this pill I have been having a menstrual cycle since age so I am ecstatic to have not seen a cycle in two monthsThere has been no spotting at all During my first packthere was very light spotting my second week and then nothing The down side thus far is that my libido has dropped and I dont orgasm as easily Also I find that my body is extra tender to touch especially my breasts
9794,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42148,3,I have been on it bc for months now it seems like this Brown discharge never goes away I get my period on time but its longer than the regular days Not sure if I should switch birth control or just keep taking it Help
9795,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42147,7,This is only my second month on Lolo but so far so good Usually by this time on other birth controls I have had debilitating migraines and cramps Where as on Lolo I have had one headache and one five minute cramping session both on the same day Definitely experienced a few mood swings and the tender boobs though to the point of my bra even hurting them which sucked but only lasted about a week Usually have a one or two day periods with mediumish flow and no cramps so only on Lolo to prevent little mes The only downside I see with it is that my period did not show up at all this month Needless to say I was scared until consulting Google and reading some other gals experiences Overall impressed with Lolo though
9796,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42145,16,This is my first BC For about the next months I had irregular periods with spotting here and there This month I totally skipped my period as of right now Im days late Took a test and it came back negative so I can attest to the missed period thing dont be too stressed whenif it happens if you take your pills correctly First couple months I cried a lot and had terribly sore boobs They also grew from a B to a D though so Im not mad NO nausea at allA few migrainesIm not pregnant and we use withdrawal and never use condoms so this pill is extremely effective and gives me that extra assurance for the lowest estrogen count Im a fan because of the scary missed period thing
9797,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42143,4,Ive been taking this pill for almost a month and this is the first birth control Ive ever taken My periods always came the same time for about days once a month but now that Im on this pill Ive had my period for almost days and still heavy bleeding not to mention I shouldnt be starting my actual peroid for another week or two But I do have to say my face is really clear though I usually dont break out that bad anyways Also havent noticed any weight gain yet My sex drive is still very high but I cant do anything about it when Im continuously bleeding all the time
9798,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,42141,3,So Ive been on Lo LoesteinFe since Nov now and Ive been liking it so far I was afraid to breakout since I always had very clear skin all of my life The good thing is my skin is still very clear and I havent gained a drastic amount of weight even though I dont eat right most of the time so thats good But I recommend to exercise and eat right while your on it The only downside is that Ive been feeling mood swings and depressed while still on this pill and Ive only felt this change just this month Because Im normally very upbeat and stress free But other then that I recommend it for not worrying about breaking out or gaining much weight
9799,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42140,3,My experience with this birth control was HORRIBLE It was the first one Ive ever taken My periods were every weeks for four days light rarely ever cramped and never really moody I got on the birth control for birth control thats it I told my doctor that and she prescribed this My moods were insane The slightest thing would set me off and Id go through about moods in min My periods were no longer normal I bled for two weeks every two weeks for the first months I called my doctors office every couple weeks but they continued to tell me keep taking it At about month my period regulated then by month I wasnt even having periods The crazy moods never stopped and the cramps were horrible I recently switched bc
9800,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42136,10,I like the pill for the light and short periods and for the obvious not getting me pregnant I have a slight problem For the past few months Ive been getting a period every two weeks Its annoying and I am thinking it has to do with the low dose Anyone else have this problem or is it just me ps Ive been on the pill for about months
9801,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42135,4,I have been on this for weeks now and no side effects thus far except for possible bloatingcant really tell if it is related yet I was previously on NuvaRing which gave me a yeast infection and on Ortho TriCyclenOrtho TriCyclen Lo many years ago and experienced morning nausea and severe mood swings constantly Thus loving it so far
9804,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42130,2,First birth control pill Ive tried The first month I had spotting and a normal period The second month I had light spotting and an extremely light day period This medication made me depressed and tired I am now two weeks into Beyaz
9805,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42128,2,Ive been taking Lo estrin fe for about months now I must be on the th or th pack by now Needed something for birth control and acne that would not cause me to gain weight like ortho tri cyclen lo did My gynecologist recommended the lowest dose of estrogen hoping it would help I have not gained any more weight since my terrible experience with ortho tri cyclen lo but my acne hasnt improved at all so Im beginning accutane and staying on lo estrin fe to combat that problem I was hoping that the pill would increase my breast size but alas it did not
9806,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42128,26,Lolo is the first birth control thats been right me I tried Seasonale and Marvelon and spotted non stop gained lbs in a year and experienced acne which Im lucky to rarely have Lolo cleared my skin I never spotted after taking it I am very good at taking it at exactly the same time everyday My periods are days and very light This month I didnt even have a period this is normal with Lolo Ive taken the lb off havent had an breakouts or mood swings either Lolo was recommended by my Dr as my periods were heavy long and painful Not anymore Highly recommended to anyone else with those issues
9807,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42116,17,I have been on this pill for months The first month my period was normal for me quite heavy the second month my period was very light and ever since I have not had a period I still notice bloating and slight weight gain before my period but no other side effects Although the pill itself is quite expensive it is worth it because I no longer have to buy hygiene products since I dont have a period
9808,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42116,10,I started Lo Loestrin Fe weeks ago and so far have had a great expierence on it no weight gainIve actually lost lbs and if anything my moods are alot better no nausea no headaches Overall this pill is good so far I was put on this due to very heavy bleeding every month and clots the size of plums coming out every min from me I had a DNC to try and correct bleeding before I started the pill and that worked for months then went right back to the same thing bleeding like crazy for weeks with clots About days into the pill my bleeding has completly stopped no cramps no clots I worry about the weight gain so hopefully I will not gain Overall I think this pill is doing its job and I would recommend
9809,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42114,8,I began taking this pill in December and stopped taking it after I finished my third pack My breasts were continuously very tender throughout the entire time The first month I did not have a period and I had two light periods per month after that however I did not have any cramping I also had slight weight gain and ance and extreme hair loss
9810,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42114,12,Ive been on this pill for about years and havent had any problems Periods are so light and last about days as long as you take the pills when youre suppose to I havent had any side effects that I have noticed This pill is perfect
9811,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42114,13,When I first starting taking Lo Loestrin Fe it was the first birth control pill I had taken so I was expecting to become a little moody which had subsided after about two weeks but besides that I was completely fine The first month on the pill I had a little breakthrough bleeding very little brown discharge only for a couple of days and this too had subsided after the first month Ever since then I have had no period no weight gain no cramps no breakthrough bleeding no spotting no nothing
9812,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42113,6,After over year without birth control I tried lo lo estrin at the insistence of my OB I tried it for months waiting for the bleeding and spotting to stop despite making sure every day I took the pill at the exact same time Besides the nonstop spotting I also found my libido affected I stopped wanting and enjoying sex I finally went back to the pill I had previously used and am back to normal periods and enjoying sex
9813,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42111,5,I am super sensitive to most birth control but this pill is perfect I have been on this pill for a year and I will continue I still experience some PMS a few acne spots on my jawline and Im extra moody hungry but I havent had a period the entire time No weight gain either
9814,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,42107,9,Ive been on this pill for about two months now and Ive experienced weight gain extreme mood changes and irregular periods which may be because I just began taking it So far its done its job but the side effects taking a toll on my body are no longer tolerable for me personally
9815,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,42104,9,Worst bc pill ever Ive been on a few different pills and ive never had a bad reaction until i took this one I was getting my period twice a month and had awful mood swings
9817,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42101,15,Been taking for months During the first month I had extremely sensitive breasts even clothing touching against me was sore Other than that my experience has been positive a little random mid month bleeding but no side effects such as headaches weight gain mood changes etc I plan to stay on it
9818,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42100,5,Im just about to start my rd month on lolo and so far its been greatThe first weeks was pretty rough as I experienced severe nausea every time I took the pill To be fair this was also the first time Ive taken a hormonal contraceptive in about years I experience about days of very light spotting the week before my period is due and my periods are pretty much nonexistent Spotting for about days I started taking this birth control to relieve debilitating menstrual cramps and since starting on this pill I havent had ANY pain AT ALL It has been life changing My sex drive and skin have both improved my breasts have grown about a cup size and my weight hasnt changed
9819,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42098,14,No side effects other than no periods
9820,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42098,7,The first few months were fine No serious side effects Obviously I did not get pregnant so it was effective in that way The side effects after maybe months or so were terrible Bleeding for weeks out of the month weight gain about pounds irritable I dealed with it because I had the mindset quotits better this than getting pregnant so earlyquot After about a year and three months Im bleeding for weeks out of the month Im switching to Loestrin More estrogen for me
9822,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42097,10,There is a reason this is the highestrated oral contraceptive on drugscom It is the best It has no equivalent This is the safest type of progestin type in terms of blood clots the pill is highly androgenic so sorry for those with a preexisting tendency towards acne this pill may not be the best for you but for the rest of us it means your sex drive will likely stay intact It has the least amount of estrogen which again means its the safest pill out there After a few months your period will be so short and so light No pill is perfect Being on the pill means fewer gains in muscle mass at the gym But this is the closest pill to perfect you will find You honestly cant do any better so dont waste your time trying
9823,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42092,13,Been on Lo Loestrin Fe for months now The first month I had spotting for weeks and was quite emotional cant specifically relate that to the birth control though could have been caused by other factors The second and third month I didnt get my period at all After that my breasts grew and I got regular periods that usually last days and are very light Love this birth control and Ive had no problems
9825,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42084,1,Ive been on this birth control going on months now ampamp I highly recommend Im very allergic to birth control but this one is by far the best Ive taken I find I tend to eat a lot more than normal but thats on some days Some days you dont wanna eat at all Im going on my th pack and I havent started a period yet but there is a side affect of no periods I dont have any mood changes No breakouts Some cramps But its the price Thank god for insurance It would cost me monthly Other than that its a great pill
9827,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42078,0,I have been on the pill for six years now and never experienced any problems up until I switched to this one I have been on it for about two years and the first six months were great I never had periods no acne slight moodiness but that seemed pretty normal And for the last year and half I have had horrible acne I have been very moody and irregularity in my periods I loved it at first but its like it suddenly took a nasty turn But every womans anatomy is different and I recommend asking a professional about different types of birth control
9829,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42076,15,Ive been on this medicine for almost weeks now It has made me have spotting but I havent really experienced anything else I havent had much of an appetite though but hey Im not complaining
9831,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,42072,2,This medicine didnt make me gain weight or give me terrible mood swings however it gave me awful dryness quotdown therequot This started approximately two an a half months in during the pack where things got regular and I got my period on schedule There was literally nothing at all being produced down there and sex was impossible The times I tried I ended up with abrasions and irritation for days afterward even with lubricant and became afraid to even do it which defeats the purpose of birth control The periods were very light and painless but it totally ruined my sex life
9832,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42071,7,I have been on this pills about months I had bad migraines on the placebo weeks for the first months on the pill and some moodiness but after that it has been great My periods are increasingly light short and cramps are way less severe I get fewer migraines and my skin is clearer
9833,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42071,0,I have been Taking this birth control for a few months now and dont think its that bad I stopped having period every month which is both a good and bad thing I have acne but dont mind taking this because it has not made it any worse I have not experienced any negative side effects I felt nauseous at times when I first began taking the pill but that was all I would recommend
9834,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42067,31,Best birth control Ive ever taken No weight gain no periods due to low hormone Doc said that was normal However why am I paying nearly for this pill I have insurance tooI want to continue using this pill because my body is taking it really well but Im going broke
9836,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42060,1,I love it I was having serious mood swings and long periods with other birth control Since Ive switched no mood swings and no period I do have a bit of acne nothing serious though I feel very normal I do not know about the weight gain as I just had a baby I havent been able to work out like I used to and I do not weigh myself but I fit into all my clothes like normal
9837,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42058,17,Doing great on this pill My moods are even keel notice moodiness near the days when you take iron but they are mild compared to the wild mood swings I experienced when I was not on the pill and I dont get any periods anymore ever My doctor said this is fine and that this can sometimes be an effect of this low dose pill great effect I have not experienced any weight gain or loss with this pill which is key Also my skin seems clearer Try it out Only downside to me so far is the cost about But seems like small price to pay for no wild mood swings and no periods
9840,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42047,50,I have been taking this for weeks now and have had a light period the whole time Everyone else is saying the opposite so Im wondering why my results are different Maybe I just need to give it more time for my body to get use to it
9843,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42042,10,Ive only been on it for two months but so far I love it My period lasts days and its super light It does make me feel a little nauseous every now and then but nothing too bad Other then that its perfect I still feel like myself and my skin is super clear I highly recommend this birth control its awesome
9844,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,42038,17,Ive been on this pill for about a month and I love it No mood swings and same sex drive The only noticable difference is my breasts They are so tender They feel as if I have a pound clip hanging on my nipples I do get nauseous through out the day but its bearable My weight is the same Sometimes I have an appetite other times I dont Overall this is a great birth control
9845,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42032,24,A little skeptical moved from minipill after a scare one month to this one So far I havent gotten a real period but rather several short brownish spotting Which fits me perfectly Love it
9846,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42031,29,Lo Loestrin Fe is by far the best birth control I have ever tried I cannot tell you how many different contraceptives I have tried and they have all made me miserable Ive had absolutely no side effects on Lo Loestrin Fe My skin is clear my periods last maybe a day and its super light Absolutely no cramps or nausea My weight fluctuates on its own so I wouldnt blame the pill for that lol
9848,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,42016,16,Have been on it for about a month and no spotting Its obviously effective because Im not pregnant but the only problems I have are weight gain Im eating like a horse and the worst acne Ive probably ever had in my life Im going to wait it out and see what happens but hoping it goes away Was on Sprintec and it made me throw up every day had to get off and so far those are the only downfalls of this one
9850,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42010,18,The best part of taking Lo Loestrin Fe is that I can still have an orgasm All the other birth control Ive ever tried Ive hated because of that and stronger side affects This pill has worked great for me
9851,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,42010,37,I wish my doctor would have told me that one side effect if you can call it that is NO PERIOD Ive been panicking thinking Im pregnant and after reading all the comments this is totally normal Ive been on it for months now and I love it Now that I know Im not pregnant I still get cramps and bloating a few break outs but no other side effects A bit pricy amp for three month supply Hoping my new insurance will cover some of it though
9852,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,42010,18,Ive been using this birth control for nearly two years now and I really like it The first month was full of painfully swollen breasts and a lot of emotions suddenly crying while eating but after that short period I havent had any other side effects My periods are short and often skipped This is certainly the best solution that Ive tried
9853,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,42007,29,I switched to this pill after using Sprintec for years and had instant weight gain I gained pounds in the first three months No noticeable changes in mood sex drive or acne My skin stayed very clear I also stopped having a period completely and although it was wonderful I could not get used to it The pregnancy panics along with the weight gain forced me to stop taking these pills
9856,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41992,17,I started taking this birth control around months ago and I had once a period twice in a month and after that I havent had a period I went to the doctor and he did a pregnancy test and it came back negative I dont have a problem with not having my period but I mean you always get that scary feeling when you dont get your period I do get migraines but that have been getting better and I personaltly lost weight Other than that Im ok with this pill
9857,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41989,16,I was on this for over two years and loved it It made my skin look great my periods were a breeze if I got one for prevention it was fabulous The only reason I was switched off of it is because my insurance changed and no longer covered this as its mo it was a little pricey Ive since switched and Ive tried two different pills and theyre horrible One gave me horrible acne the other migraine headaches so horrible if I didnt lay down I felt faint Im actually going back to my Dr and will ask to be put back on this again
9859,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41981,12,I have not had a negative experience with this pill Now the reason this pill was prescribed to me was due to the low amount of estrogen it contained I have horrible side effects when I take pills or birth control in general that has a lot of estrogen in it If you are taking this for acne it is not going to help you It is not meant to help treat acne My periods have been much lighter and last month I didnt have a period On the website it also states it is not uncommon to miss a period with this birth control I am not complaining that I dont have one I have not seen weight gain or mood swings either It is working perfectly for me Probably the best birth control I have been on honestly No side effects
9862,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41964,22,Well after reading the reviews Im not so worried about the fact that I havent had my period for months Ive definitely been freaking out and took pregnancy tests in the past months even though Ive only had sex twice I just had to be sure lol It would have been nice if my doctor would have mentioned that this was one of the side effects instead of me finding it out on my own after months of a normal cycle She put me on this pill because I was experiencing daily discharge with the generic Tricyclen That has ceased to be a problem since starting this particular kind of pill I have not had any negative side effects other than not having my period sure its no picnic but it gives me peace of mind every month
9863,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41962,14,I had great experience over years No extreme side effects no weight gain no acne just AWESOME
9865,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41959,8,Ive been on Lo Loestrin FE for over a year now and Im happy with the birth control I didnt gain any weight I didnt have any negative side effects Its expensive out of pocket but now my insurance covers it so thats a plus
9866,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,41959,20,I started Lo Loestrin Fe because I was having some irregularities with my period and also to prevent pregnancies This pill was awful First of all I already suffer from acne which is slowly improving However this made my acne really bad and I began to develop cystic acne I began to get constant awful migraines and I dont have a history of migraines I was also getting moody The pill affects everyone differently But this pill did not work for me After suffering a whole month with migraines and cystic acne I stopped once my pack was done I considered trying to stick it out but decided it wasnt worth it
9867,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41947,33,I got on the pill in May I got my period that month but havent gotten one since Ive taken pregnancy tests every month and they all come out negative
9868,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,41933,23,Ive had a light period ever since I started taking this pill I on my rd month My Dr told me it would get better but it has not Maybe the amount of hormone is too low Im not happy with it
9870,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41914,13,Im nearing the end of my th month on this pill It was the first birth control Ive been on Prior to taking this pill I always had acne problems My first month on Lo Loestrin Fe was absolutely horrible acnewise I even developed a large cyst on my forehead yikes It went away in a few weeks Id say after the first months my acne was back to normal and now its beginning to get better I see a lot of girls talking about how horrible it makes their acne but my dermatologist said give it months and see Try and wait it out it will probably get better I had no side effects aside from the acne periods last month but Im assuming my body is still getting used to it
9871,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41912,46,years old Was prescribed Lo Loestrin Fe for heavy frequent bleeding OB told me it might even suppress periods First cycle had light discharge for days Second cycle nothing no period Crossing fingers
9872,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41907,39,I have have been taking Lo Loestrin for months now and only had one short light period which scares me because I am not used to not having a period I havent has any side effects with the birth control Im yrs old and about lbs I gain weight very easily with other birth control pills but havent with Lo Loestrin I love the pill other than not having a period for months Im not sure if thats normal or not definitely have to speak to the doctor Lo Loestrin works real well preventing pregnancy thats the reason I am sticking with it and plus it doesnt have all these extra hormones like other birth controls
9873,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41906,19,Ive been taking this medication for about a year and a half now I began taking it because other birth controls made me moody and the obvious fact that Im not ready to be pregnant yet This medication definitely makes you nauseous I feel nauseous nearly every day I havent had a period since the first two months that I started the pill Normally I wouldnt complain about a lack of periods but other side effects Ive had include frequent Im talking back to back to back yeast infections and TMI vaginal dryness Intercourse can be very painful Im switching off of this medication as I have tried everything to no avail Being on birth control seems pointless if I cant even have sex
9876,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41793,19,I have been on different birth controls from the shot to different pills and have always had bad side effects I have been on Lo Loestrin Fe for a month now and I love it My hormones are balanced out no mood swings no depression no weight gain nothing I think Im actually losing weight and I feel great The only down fall is I have been spotting a little bit and my breasts are tender my mood is a little off the week before my period Other than that no complaints If you have has trouble with birth control like me I advise you to try this I have gotten severe depression weight gain and everything else from other birth controls If you get a green card from plan parenthood this pill is free
9877,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41784,30,Honestly I LOVE this birth control I am very sensitive to birth control and this is the first one that has helped me First off for anyone who doesnt have insurance GO TO THE WEBSITE There is a discount card there that you can sign up for that works for scripts My monthly script is now First off my periods were AWFUL I had cramps so bad This has increased my breast size by a cup cleared up my acne havent gained any weight I am a very healthy eater although my periods are light maybe lasting days my cramps are very mild if any Aleve liquid gels are the best Be sure you take this at the SAME TIME everyday Stay safe and healthy
9879,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41772,18,Lo Loestrin Fe works really well for me I went on this birth control because I had a very irregular period and terrible cramps Sometimes I would skip months and sometimes Id get it twice in one month Id have to use a heating pad and even that didnt help very much It was a mess Ive been on Lo Loestrin Fe for almost two years now No period to speak of and no cramps I had a very light period for the first few months I started until it eventually disappeared completely I have no bad symptoms No acne or mood swings My only complaint is that my sex drive is DEAD when I used to have quite the active libido which is the only reason Im thinking of switching birth controls
9881,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41768,32,I have currently been on the pill for over a year After my daughter I tried the Depo shot it made my periods stop and worked for a few months But I became emotional and gained weight For the last year or more I have been using the Lo LoEstrin Pill which is amazing The positive thing about the pill is I have lost weight my face has barely any to no breakouts and best of all NO period The negative thing about the pill is I do feel more tired then usual I am also going to school for nursing work hours take care of the lawnhouse and have a year old it could be my activity Only is covered by my insurance which leaves me paying My sex drive is balanced I have not seen much change Highly recommend this birth control
9883,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41758,12,Pro little to no period I didnt have one at all after month four no weight gain I am very active though no mood swingsCon Acne headaches not migraines little to no sex drive The sex drive issue is why Im trying a different birth control I love my husband and want to enjoy married life
9884,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41751,11,Best ever I was going to give up on birth control pills until I tried this one amazing
9886,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41740,120,First off youre probably reading reviews because youre looking to go on this pill or youve just recently been prescribed this pill I was just like you a few months ago and the paranoid person that I am didnt like the reviews I was seeing but I decided to go ahead and try it I love this pill I have no side effects and if anything it made my period better its shorter comes right on time when the pill changes color minor cramps no mood swings I have nothing negative to say about the pill at all just take it every single day at the same time I think its really important to know that a lot of the people who write on here write because they have had a bad experience with a pill and wanted to warn others about it
9887,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41738,15,Ive been on this pill for about years I originally started taking it to relieve my horrible periods not to avoid pregnancy I normally have really horrible periods that last days with heavy bleeding immobilizing cramping and sometimes nausea Thank God for this pill The first months I would have periods every weeks and with every month they got lighter and lighter until my period disappeared completely I will occasionally spot but it will only last a day or two I have NO cramps such a life saver I have taken other birth control pills and none of them worked this well for meAs far as side effects I have absolutely NO sex drive and bad acne I used to have a really clear face
9888,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41737,10,Have been on Lo Loestrin Fe for mo At first I experienced light bleeding and headaches After a few months on it I have not had a period in months and no other side effects Not having a period does make me somewhat weary but will be visiting gyno this week for yearly check up
9889,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41736,20,I loved this birth control It has been the only birth control Ive been on The only complaint I have is that my breasts were hard as a rock the first month I had no acne or weight gain and my moods are stable My periods are about days compared to being days
9890,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41733,5,Ive been using Lo Loestrin Fe for almost months now I began using them after I gave birth They are truly effective I dont suffer from spotting or periods and I dont have to worry about getting pregnant My doctor did mention with drinking this your stopping your period if you have periods you are probably taking it wrong Its normal to spot a little on the last week of the pack
9891,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41733,17,It works but stressful experience This pill made me skip my period for days Which resulted in a lot of anxiety and pregnancy tests It also took over a full month of quitting the medicine before I got my cycle to come back
9892,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,41732,4,I was on the shot my first in December of next was due in March Barely had a period but when I did it would last days straight then I switched to the pill and since Ive taken it Ive had a period non stop Before any birth control my period would last days I stopped taking birth control all together it caused back pain cramps headaches It was supposed to help cysts but Id rather go through that pain then with this
9893,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41731,9,While I feel like every single person reacts differently to different birth controls Id still like to show that for me in particular Lo Loestrin Fe worked absolutely beautifully The first few months were a little rough as expected for a first time birth control user The only hard part in these two months was that my periods were very heavy and longer than usual about days as opposed to the normal After my quottransition monthsquot Ive completely stopped getting periods or any bleeding for the past months now and it has been great I have no mood swings acne weight gain headaches nausea etc This being said everyone reacts differently Personally Im in love with everything except for the price mo which is why I have to switch
9894,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,41727,20,I have been taking Lo Loestrin Fe for months now I started this pill after having the Mirena for years and having little to no period a month For the first month on this pill I had a normal period but the nd and rd month I have been having extremely heavy bleeding and blot clots So far my periods are coming about every days On For days Off for days I feel terrible I feel tired having diarrhea and headaches My cramps are in my back and constant And I am not sure if the pill is to blame but I have been getting anxious amp nervous a lot for no reason lately I made up my mind to stop taking the pill and make a doc appointment Hope this helps others
9895,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41712,9,I bought this months before I got married and had very little side effects I have been married years and I havent gotten pregnant yet I think the only annoyance is that my period comes every other month and that I get some spotting off and on throughout the month My periods are shorter and there is less bleeding which is a nice thing I havent taken any other birth control but Im thinking of switching to a cervical cap a year before we want to have kids so I can get my hormones regulating correctly again
9896,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41711,16,I have been on Lo Loestrin Fe for years Prior to taking this pill I suffered from horrible periods that would last up to weeks go away for a week then return They were incredibly heavy with severe clotting After trying numerous other birth control pills Lo Loestrin was the only one that stopped the bleeding altogether For the first time in my life I have no bleeding other than occasional spotting every couple of months I also lost pounds going from to All of that has been extremely positive except it gave me horrible acne which I have never had ever I now use a RetinA which helps but I still have very large pores where before I had beautiful porcelain skin My hair has also thinned dramatically
9897,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,41696,54,I started this pill to alleviate migraines and prevent pregnancy Overall my experience with this pill has been wonderful from day one I dont have any breakouts no migraines no weight gain and I havent gotten my period once in the seven months Ive been on it The downside Im overly emotional I will cry over a commercial now And Im paranoid all the time of being pregnant
9899,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41904,31,I never had a bad experience with this pill I freaked out when I first started taking it because I didnt have a period But I fell in love with it I dont have periods I dont get any weight gain or mood swings I have been on this pill for about years now It does take a bit for your both do get use to a pill So dont hate it It will take a month to a few I havent had any problems with it
9902,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,41902,15,While this birth control did its job by being a good contraceptive I have a lot of symptoms with itI gained lbs in the first months had so much acne and just felt like complete crap I couldnt do it anymore after the th month so I stopped taking itEveryone is different but it is definitely not for me
9903,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41897,16,Im getting ready to finish up my second pack at the end of this week I have to say after the first month I really debated to quit taking it I had HORRIBLE side effects Constant headaches muscle aches and spasms and my period was HORRIFIC Then again this was the first real period Ive had in years It came on my nd week and lasted throughout the rest of my pack and it was HEAVY Like boxes of super tampons heavy I was breaking out cramps were TERRIBLE irritable and felt like I had no energy BUT I found out I was also extremely deficient in Vitamin D and I needed more potassium Now that Im taking my multivitamins Ive found that my side effects have really subsided My period is LIGHT and my sex drive has increased
9904,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41887,13,Im a week from completing my nd pack of this birth control and so far so good My first two weeks I experienced slight nausea nothing to stop my day I did have recurrent headaches during that period as well however theyve diminished in occurrence My first period was extremely light I only saw pale streaks upon wiping nothing transferred to my liner I have experienced a leap in my appetite so Ive had to take more care in my eating habits Overall Id recommend this pill to others My effects have been minimal and I still feel like myself
9905,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,41884,25,This is my first month of using this birth control I havent had a period yet Im broke out in bad acne having mood swings and depression which I dont like I stay angry at everybody Im on my last week of the pill Ill never take this pill again
9906,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,41869,20,Some background I am have never been on birth control and have regular periods Im on my th pack of Lo Loestrin Fe and so far am pretty pleased with it other than a few annoying things I did experience some spotting in the very beginning and when I started my th pack I got my period weeks early which was surprising since Im so used to having a regular period I also seem to get a mild yeast infection around the time of my period which as you can imagine is awful I dont really want to stop taking this pill because my skin has cleared up and I havent gained any weight Just dealing with the yeast with probioticsyogurt and hopefully itll all balance out If not Im just going to stop taking it
9907,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,41866,16,Ive been on this pill for about months now and I am really considering changing it I have a really weird period side effect where it changes the color of my period amp it makes it come early or late amp it always makes me scared that Im pregnant Plus I can never loose weight being on this pill Lastly the pill makes me very moody as well I am going to talk to my doctor about it at the end of the month
9908,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41866,8,I took Lo Loestrin Fe for months It was the first contraceptive I had taken but my body had a hard time getting used to it I broke out in mild hives I had muscle aches nausea mood swings the first week After that things pretty well smoothed out slowly I didnt break through bleed didnt gain weight acne cleared up maybe periods the whole time I took it It definitely helped with cramps and pain which is why I began taking it Though it worked good after about months of taking it I began getting migraines and feeling tired all the time and cramping a little more so Im switching off it but it was good for me for a while I really liked it
9910,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41862,13,Overall this is a great pill I love that I am not putting nearly as many hormones into my body as other brands However there are some side effects that Ive experiencedThe first month was miserable for me I had terrible mood swings as my body adjusted to the hormones However after the first month my mood and acne regulated Like many other people who reviewed here I did experience periods almost constant every other week for the first months on the pill but my cramps were nonexistent With each month my period lightened and I havent had a period minus spotting for months nowOverall this pill is great but if you like a regular period to reassure yourself try a different pill My advice wait it out
9912,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41857,24,This is the first birth control I have been on and after hearing all the birth control horror stories that friendsfamily had Im happy to say that my experience with this pill so far has been a good one The first month or two I did experience some acne and occasional nausea as well as going from a B to C cup a welcome change However none of the symptoms have been any worse than symptoms of a period My period lightened soon after beginning the pill packs and I stopped getting my period alltogether about months after starting the pills which my Obgyn told me early on was to be expected My insurance also completely covers this pill so thats definitely a plus
9913,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41852,14,This pill worked very well for me I have been taking it for over years for my horrible menstrual cramps and I love it I am a very petite pound year old girl and this has not caused any side effects for me at all I had no weight gain although I went from a B cup to a C cup but that I didnt mind Overall very good birth control definitely would recommend it
9914,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,41847,9,I have only been on this pill for a week however I already want to switch I had acne problems before this pill and I thought by going on this I could kill to birds with one stone clear up my acne and prevent pregnancy But I cannot wait for this pack to be over so I can switch Within the first day my acne got x worse and its only been a week but its worse than its ever been in the last year I dont even want to look in the mirror I havent noticed any other side effects yet but I wont be surprised if theres more negative ones to come
9915,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,41837,19,My first three months on this pill were like a DREAM I switched to it from Orsythia which I had been taking for years because I was having painful periods and my sex drive was gone This pill completely stopped my period with NO spotting or anything and never any cramps No acne no mood changes My breasts even grew I was so happy Now I am on month and it is hell Im having migraines and nausea all day and bad mood swings I am stopping this pill and going back to my OB
9916,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41837,22,So the first time I was on the pill I was put on Beyaz Beyaz made me gain about Ibs It made me crazy with mood swings I got off of it within months After that I would go back and forth on whether to get back on birth control So about a month and a half ago I decided to go to the doctor for a check up I told my doctor about my experience with Beyaz He told me that he had the perfect birth control for me Lo Loestrin Fe I was scared to take it but it was worth a shot If anything this birth control has made my weight stick I have had NO mood swings No weight gain The only symptoms Ive had was going from a C cup to a D cup and breast tenderness near my period which is overall normal for me This is the best birth control by far
9917,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41831,12,Ive been on this birth control for over a year and overall I had a really positive experience with it I didnt experience any mood swings had little to mild acne around my period never experienced any pregnancy scares and had no nausea headaches or weight gain The only problem I experienced with it and ultimately had to switch birth control because of it was the fact that I would throw up for hours whenever I consumed ANY amount of alcohol To make sure it was the birth control I stopped taking it and after or so months I was able to drink again without any problems Though I feel this is very rare situation overall I believe this birth control was great
9920,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41815,27,Ive been on this pill over years now and I love it This summer and last summer I had some random cystic acne though I am not sure it is related to the pill because other times my skin is perfectly clear No weight change Only problem is I havent had a period in the years Ive taken this not even spotting My doctor says not to worry about it but I am considering switching because of it
9922,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41811,5,I just switched to this from Loestrin and I am happy I did Loestrin had me crazy moody bad acne and melasma on my face Once I switched to Lo Loestrin Fe no more crazy mood acne is pretty much gone Just a few here and there but thats normal for me Period is pretty normal with only spotting on the last week As for the Melasma It stopped spreading but I am now seeing a dermatologist to fix it My only downside with Lo Loestrin Fe is that I have noticed my hair falling out a little bit more than usual but I hope it is one thing that will subside as I keep taking it Price wise it is reasonable My insurance doesnt cover so Im suppose to pay but with my coupon card I only pay Overall I am happy with Lo Loestrin Fe
9923,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41807,20,Ive just hit the year mark on taking this and I have to say its been a positive experience Before taking this I hadnt had a period for over months During my first month on the exact day it was supposed to start I finally got my period Since then my periods have only gotten lighter and lighter Now I spot for maybe days a month on the whitebrown colored pills The only other times I spot are if Im careless about taking it at the same time every day I have noticed a decrease in migraines I didnt get them that often but still slight increase in breast size no weight change and not really any change in acne The only downside is that Im a little more emotional about silly things I wouldnt normally be
9925,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41673,12,The first month was the worst I had a lot if mood swings and very tender breasts After that the side effects have been very minimal I no longer have my period but around the time I used to get my period every month I get light cramps I also get very tender breasts during this time but they have gotten bigger since taking the birth control The only major complaint I have is that Ive had a major decrease in sex drive as well as being very tired in the morning I switched to this birth control because I got very sick every morning I like this one much better
9926,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41670,8,This birth control is good for me but I did have MAJOR side effects I had almost constant bleeding for about months and nausea for the first month After that though everything is smooth sailing The only other complaint I would have is breast tenderness
9927,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41668,18,I have been on this pill for over a year and I love it I used to be on the Nuvaring and it was the absolute worst experience I was constantly cryingarguingdepressed without any reason I also gained a lot of weight on the ring I have not gained any weight in Lo Loestrin Fe except for in my breasts I also have not had any mood swings in comparison to the ones I had before on the ring My periods when I do get them which is rare now last for days and are super light A downfall is that since Lo Loestrin Fe is so new it is still pricey without insurance coverage But it is great and after using it Im hesitant to switch to anything else
9930,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41663,16,Ive been trying to find the right birth control for me for about years now and this is by far my favorite Ive been on it for three months and its helped me a lot with my cramps I barely even have any and when I do they are very manageable I didnt gain any weight and I didnt have any breakouts I did have some mood swings in the first month but by the second month I didnt have any I did have a little breakthrough bleeding the first month but that only lasted about two days I just finished my third pack and I have to say its amazing I didnt have any cramps and I also didnt have a period YAY Its a keeper
9931,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,41661,15,I have been on this bc for months and its been the worst months of my life I had pretty clear skin before taking this but now its awful I have tons of small pimples all over my forehead and chin and big pimples on my back It has also left bad scars on my face As far as weight goes I havent gained any weight Ive lost weight if anything I am switching at the end of my pack because I just cant handle the awful acne
9933,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,41657,24,I have only been on for a month and I have mood swings breast tenderness horrible cramps food cravings no period and Im always tired like winded tired
9934,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41649,21,I read a few of the reviews on this page and many said that in the first month or so they had terrible acne This is also true with me but this is the only birth control Ive been on where my skin is clear after about month three I also always suffered from SEVERE mood swings with other birth control crying over nothing bouts of rage extreme insecurity but this is so much better The only downside is that for some reason I am very tired especially in the morning its almost impossible to wake up even with hrs But the changes in my mood outweigh the tiredness Great for people who have a lot of bad side effects with other birth controls
9935,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,41648,12,In high school I took Loestrin FE and never had any skin problems my skin was always clear I was switched to Lo Loestrin which has lower hormones and I guess it messed up all my hormones because I started breaking out in the worst cystic acne A new pimple would come up every day Now it is out of control and Im starting to develop dark spots scarring from the cystic acne
9937,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,41629,14,I am about halfway through my nd pack of Lo Loestrin Fe The first month I had minor spotting on one day no big deal I also noticed that I had a couple of pimples but since there were only a couple I figured it could have been my normal hormonal changes during the month However halfway through this second month and my chinmouth area has never had such acne I had occasional acne like many people but of the time my skin was clear before Now I feel like I wake up everyday with a new batch of red spots I want to stop this pill now midpack but dont want to give myself menstrual issues at the same time so Im trying to stick it out until the end of the pack
9938,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41620,17,After being on a rather absurd amount of birth controls in the past years this was the only one that didnt cause me to have yeast infections Most obgyns do not believe birth control can cause yeast infections but After days of remaining on Lutera and Diflucan I believe mine was convinced I was given Lo Loestrin and I have not had a single yeast infection for months I dont feel as moody on this birth control and my body acts as though Im not even on birth control This is a negative for me because I have no breasts without a high dose of hormones Overall I think its wonderful and I recommend this if you have the same issues as I experienced with other birth controls I did experience acne when starting on the second month I had none
9939,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,41606,15,The first month was great It really helped with my PMS mood swings which were awfulHAd a short period with regular bad cramps but was elated that it helped my depressive mood swings which is why I started taking it Now Im in my nd month on my nd week and am bleeding and bloated Feeling more bloated than usual tooHave been bleeding for four days now Am hoping it will stop and even out because the aiding of my former mood swings is wonderful
9940,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,41606,22,I loved this pill at first it got rid if my terrible cramps A few months after however I had two periods each month Now I have a period every other week The birth control pill is a hitormiss type of business
9943,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,41600,26,Lo Loestrin Acne cysts I have always had clear skin with the occasional break out but nothing serious and since switching to this pill about months ago Ive had a never ending cycle of painful and ugly red blemishes My dermatologist assessed my skin and after two minutes with me determined that I had Lo Loestrin skin She said it is absolutely the worst for skin because of its significantly lower estrogen levels Anyway I just wanted to share this knowledge Im switching back to Yasmin
9944,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41596,19,Before I tried this pill I tried so many others and the experiences were bad This is the only pill that I feel like myself on It probably is because this is the lowest dose pill available Why put extra hormones in your body if you can prevent pregnancy and lighten periods with the minimal amount of hormones I really like it Ive recommended it to several friends and they are liking it too
9945,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,41592,27,I switched to this birth control from Yaz because my periods although controlled were still days long and heavy When I switched to this pill I gained about lbs was intensely moody and noticed my hair and skin became extremely oily I was on it for months and it only got worse I had breakthrough bleeding the entire time The second month I was on it I bled for weeks straight It was absolutely miserable I know birth control affects every person differently but this was AWFUL for me
9947,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,41586,15,first off let me start by saying that I am sensitive to hormones I cant seem to find one that doesnt make me sick or extremely moody I was put on this for Endometriosis pain and the first day I took it ate with it and was fine The second ay I took it I also ate with it about pm I went to bed at midnight and woke up at am sick to my stomach shaking and my heart racing just like I have before with another pill and was vomiting for about hours I am now days later bleeding and my period wasnt suppose to be here until weeks from now It doesnt feel like a period but its not fun either Wouldnt reccomend for anyone who is hormone sensitive
9949,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41582,16,I have been on this medication since August when I had to get my Mirena IUD removed I had never been on the pill before this so I was nervous about its effectiveness but it has been wonderful so far I have had no weight gain no acne no crazy mood swings I have had my period regularly when I was supposed to on the whitebrown pills Last month I didnt get my period for the first two white pills and got very worried but I had a very light period on the two brown pill days I have slight breast tenderness sometimes but nothing major It is great that it is such a low dose of estrogen which significantly lowers the risk of blood clotsI would highly recommend this medication to anyone looking for a great birth control
9951,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,41580,17,Ive been taking Lo Loestrin for months now my body has not adjusted to this dumb pill Ive had weeks periods one week without bleeding than I start again Im feeling depressed all I wanna do is cry I havent had sex with My husband because the bleeding and all weve been doing is fighting I hate this pill Im done taking this damn pill its no good
9952,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,41577,7,i started taking lo days ago I have experiences mood swings not severe but just basically feeling weird My body is just not right I bled lightly first days of my period and now I am bleeding heavy for days with bad cramping and back aches I feel like I am craving junk food and I definitely gained a couple pounds within these few days as crazy as it sounds Hopefully my body will adjust bc I plan on staying on these
9954,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41575,8,So far Ive been on Lo loestrin for about months Pros No mood swings no weight gain convenient to use no pregnancy no nauseousness low estrogen Cons Period every other week which sucks but at least it is not a constant period Hopefully by my fourth month my periods will be back to normal breast tenderness every day but not too painful and occasional headache I am very satisfied overall and plan to be on this pill for the next years Its great knowing the risk of a blood clot is so much lower with such a minimul amount of estrogen
9955,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,1,41573,12,Took lo loestrin fe for weeks and immediately had to discontinue Started with spotting during the second week developed anxiety attacks and unnecessary fears back pain lo libido After I stopped it took a week for me to return to being functional Its been about weeks since I have stopped the pill and havent gotten a period and every few weeks symptoms of anxiety and unnecessary fears come back
9957,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41569,15,I would say Ive had an overall good experience I just took my last pill from my first pack It was a little rocky at first I did experience some unusal heavy bleeding that lasted about days midway through the pack But it has calmed down Ive had no mood swings or emotionalmental side effects My weight is pretty much the same and I didnt get sick or have headaches Im just going to monitor the bleeding on my next pack of pill I also have to see if my insurance will cover it I got my first three pack from my obgyn as samples to see if I like it Im going to continue using it and Ill update you guys in days lol I hope this helped someone
9958,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,41568,4,I was origininally on Loestrin Fe for almost three years I then switched to this because loestrin Fe switched brands I guess So I figured Id try something new Im and have now been on lo loestrin for almost months I have noticed a major breakout of acne in my chin area I never breakout so it was very unusual for that to occur I as well noticed a weight gain of abuout pounds just in these two months I am pretty active and eat well and normally cant gain weight so I am still not happy about that I have also noticed having intense headaches Im not sure if its from the birth control but ive never had them like this before The pill does decrease any cramping or nausea I had previously Probably going to switch back
9959,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,41561,22,Loestrin Fe did a lot better than the Lo Loestrin Fe I only got this prescription because my insurance covers it and its similar to what I was taking beforejust less hormones They apparently discontinued the birth control I used to take Since Ive been on this one Ive been a little moodier more acne breast tenderness and cramping without periods Ive lost weight and my cupbra size actually got smaller Honestly its starting to freak me out a bit because I havent been this tender with a birth control only while pregnant with my two children I take it as its prescribedsame time every day never skipping a dose Hitting my rd month on it no periods or spotting at all
9960,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41557,20,I had surgery a little over a year ago because I had a cm cyst on my ovary Two months later more cysts started to develop so I went on Lo Loestrin to stop the pain and help my periods They were extremely heavy with bad cramping had to change my super plus tampon every hour Now after being on it for months Ive only had spotting as my period At first no side effects but now Im noticing a little weight gain nothing traumatic I definitely love this pill and recommend it to everyone
9961,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,4,41554,3,I started this birth control three weeks ago and now I have the worst acne Ive had since being a teenager Im breaking out with hormonal acne that no matter what just dont want to go away I know you are supposed to wait for months for your hormones to level out but I dont know how much more of this I can take I havent had any other major side effectsa little nausea but thats about it
9962,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41554,16,I love this pill I didnt give it a because nothing is perfect but I was on Loestrin Fe and I would get my period for like a day and I kept track with my period planner I would get cramps and my breast would get very tender and my mood would change as well as my appetite This medicine is expensive without insurance Then my doctor recommended I switch to Lo Loestrin Fe I was a bit skeptical because I didnt want to end up having more periods Turns out that when I switched I only had a period for days straight in June and now we are in October and I havent had any cramps or a period for that matter I do have a lot of discharge which is a side effect no mood swings or anything like that
9963,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41553,5,I am yrs old and I was experiencing a hormone imbalance so my doctor decided to try and balance my hormones out and gave me Lo Loestrin Fe which is the birth control with the lowest amount of estrogen on the market I was to test it out for months and I am on my second month Its actually pretty great I experienced no side effects and so far its going great
9964,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41541,8,I had no problems with this birth control and I loved it My periods only lasted from days with VERY little cramping I was pretty much disappointed when my OB told me that I couldnt get back on it for whatever reason
9965,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41538,17,Im first birth control pills Ive ever used Im on my fourth month getting close to starting the fifth pack Pros thus far no breast tenderness they did increase in size no acne skin actually cleared up no weight gain Im very active to begin with no nausea or headaches much lighter periods prior to the pill my periods were heavy enough where both a pad and a tampon were needed Now a tampon alone is good enoughCons ever since starting it Ive been having two periods a month day cycle and its about two days longer than period prior to taking this pill The pros definitely outweigh the con but I cant stand having two periods a month
9966,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41537,17,This is the only birth control I have ever used I have been on it for about months and its great For the first month or two I noticed a slight weight gain lbs but I was able to lose it once my body got used to the pill My breasts grew almost a full cup size went from a large C to a comfortable D They were also incredibly tender and sore but this passed after about a month I was EXTREMELY moody and always craved chocolate Overall it was like PMS for about month then everything went back to normal I no longer bleed each month its more like occasional spotting for a few days I would definitely recommend this birth control but it is expensive without insurance
9967,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41534,13,I originally took this pill to regulate my periods and obviously prevent pregnancy Before taking any sort of birth control I had PMS with moderate to heavy periods Ever since this pill my period is where the blue pills stop and my period is so light no cramps no PMS But I have realized myself gaining a little weight My breasts definitely seem a little bigger so used to a B cup so when they get bigger I know the difference This pill has done a good job I havent had sex without a condom while being on this birth control I see less acne though
9968,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41528,31,Best birth control Ive been on Its the only one that hasnt caused migraines for me I have light spotting or no period at all each month My mood has greatly improved No weight gain No acne Only drawback has been decreased sex drive but not enough to make a huge difference Highly recommend this pill
9969,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41513,14,Just started taking the first pack I noticed that I was having mood swings the first week it made my period last for about weeks but I know my bodys still adjusting Ive had breast tenderness and I feel like theyve honestly gotten bigger in the past weeks Im always hungry and my sex drive is through the roof
9972,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41502,21,I was on it for a year I love to eat Never noticed increase in weight gain always have had same body figure I wasnt sexually active so cant vote on that effectiveness I hear its expensive but the State pays for mine Im considering to go back to it Pros clear skin pimples a day before I start but thats it No cramps Ive always suffered from bad ones Energetic No breast tenderness Cons On or week before very emotional I never got my period which is why I decided to get off it Dr said it was normal I got my cycle a week after I got off the pill stated side effects were depression Ive had it amp this possibly increased it a bit Possibly caused hypertension Everyone is different Give it at least months
9973,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41500,12,In terms of solving my hormone imbalance I had low estrogen due to previous weight loss this didnt jump start me but it did make me feel a lot better My mood increased my libido increased my non existent breasts actually fit into an A cup less vaginal dryness I was happy Until my doctor thought itd be best to up my dosage It was probably the worst mistake ever I have one more medication to try before she lets me back onto Lo Loestrin Im honestly praying the new medicine doesnt work because Ive been miserable since stopping
9975,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41112,19,I started my first pack of Lo Loestrin Fe in May The first month I started pill on the first day of cycle My cycle lasted way longer than normal The second month of pill only spotted about days I am now currently on my third month and have had no bleeding yet It makes me feel better reading others that are experiencing same thing It will certainly be a money maker for companies who make pregnancy test as missed periods make us all a little nervous I guess its normal with this medication I enjoy reading different experiences Thanks
9976,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,3,41109,14,I experienced bloating depression acne No breast tenderness and no weight change I had very little breakthrough bleeding and day quotperiodsquot I didnt have mood swings although I was freakishly mellowed out I quickly fell into a deep depression complete with suicidal thoughts and I have never had either or these before My acne was intense especially on my back I also had a strange sensation of having out of body experiences for lack of better description I was quottherequot but I felt like my mind wasnt but I know and understand this is a rare side effect
9977,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41101,46,Lo Loestrin Fe is the first birth control Ive ever been put on and what can I say I LOVE IT Its cleared my face no weight gain if anything Ive lost a couple of pounds I have tons of energy my periods last two days now with no cramping and I dont bleed much my sex drive is through the roof and its actually making sex feel xs better than it used to Miracle pill I guess or at least thats what my fiance says It doesnt make me moody and its not that expensive with insurance The only con is that for the first few days of using it I had some drowsiness but most new medicines I try make me drowsy I recommend it
9978,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41100,4,I have been on the pill for probably the past years and I started with regular Loestrin and I had the worst symptoms nausea mood swings and irregular spotting My doctor then switched me to Lo Loestrin and Ive been on it for the past year and a half I love it No acne light or no period absolutely no cramps minimal cramps no nausea It worked great The only thing is that its for one month but my insurance lets me gets three months for
9979,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41097,11,Ive been on Lo Loestrin for a little over a month now Ive experienced slight weight gain no more than lbs all of which seemed to end up around my midsection of course No increase in breast size which I was greatly hoping for I was previously on Ortho TriCyclen for a month and that was bad The lower dose of hormones in this pill seems to really be working for me However I didnt even get so much as a slight period last week when I was supposed to have one Im one of those women who want a period EVERY month just to be sure so Im a bit unhappy with the lack of a period on this birth control I occasionally experience nausea fatigue and irritability but nothing that interferes terribly with my life
9980,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,41093,9,I began taking Lo Loestrin Fe in December I am quot and lbs so my OBGYN prescribed it because of its low amount of hormones It took about three months for it to regulate my periods and for the headaches and nausea to go away and then my periods came two days a month and were extremely light with no cramps All of a sudden my periods started arriving earlier and earlier to the point where I started two weeks early and had a weeklong period I havent had any pregnancy scares weight gain or crazy side affects from Lo Loestrin Fe but the fact that the low hormone dosage cant control my menstrual cycle is making me switch birth control
9983,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41083,7,My physician gave me some sample packs to try for my heavy periods I had my tubes tied yrs ago so I didnt need it as birth control Started my pack the first day of my period as directed I almost gave up and quit taking as my period lasted days But after that everything was fine No side effects and no periods Unfortunately I went to fill my prescription and my out of pocket cost is
9986,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41075,9,I have been on this pill for about a month now I have one more pill to take before I start my second month I have increased breast tenderness and have LOST weight I do however have a bigger appetite and my sex drive has increased a whole since coming off the Mirena I did not have a period but not sure if I ever will since I havent had a period since Dec of So far I like the pill but reading reviews Im seeing that most REAL side effects dont come until after the second month
9987,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41072,4,I started taking this months ago Im sexually active but it was mainly for cramps and heavy bleeding I had heavy bleeding the first month every other week but now my period comes for a day or two it was days when I wasnt on Birth Control My cramping was horrible ever since I first started my period at I was in the ER every month Now Ive never been better The only thing that I have a problem with is mood swings I take EPO regularly to help it I love this pill
9988,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41067,11,I used Lo Loestrin Fe for about months I consistently got spotting every nd week and felt sluggish with little sex drive I did not gain any weight but I would occasionally have headaches The spotting was extremely irritating and sometimes I would not have a period at all which in a way is nice but is also concerning when you are relying on it to tell you whether or not you are pregnant Last month I went up a level to the regular Loestrin and I absolutely love it I have had no problems on it whatsoever no spotting no exhaustion no headaches and my sex drive is back And now I can time when my period is coming as it is far more regular than it has been previously
9989,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,9,41065,10,Absolutely LOVE this pill I had major issues on other pills with being irritable irrational emotional and feeling symptoms of withdrawl during the placebo week Decided to try the lower estrogen with only days of placebos and Ive had no issues Periods are wierd on this pill Sometimes I get them sometimes I dont Sometimes they are in the middle of the pack They are very expensive but completely worth it I feel great on these pills
9990,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,2,41059,2,Been taking for months first months were ok but now I am getting acne worse than I have ever had in my life and its expensive
9994,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41047,17,I have had horrible experiences with birth control they made me emotionally crazy This birth control is awesome First month I had spotting for a couple of weeks but by the nd pack it all went away and my periods are around days and LIGHT I used to have HEAVY HEAVY bleeding and barely be able to get out of bed This has been great for me
9995,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,5,41037,4,I have a hard time with BC pills due to irritability and being emotional I must say Lo loestrin Fe really helped my emotional side but as far as my irritability it was awful My sex drive was greatly decreased and I always felt like something was wrong I really wanted a pill to work but Ive tried about now and my Dr thinks I just cant handle the hormones in pills
9997,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,10,41021,3,Im and I have only taken pills so Im on my eighth day So far I feel no different except for things My sex drive has actually increased I dont know if its teenage hormones or the birth control and my breasts are more sensitive I havent noticed any mood changes Before this pill I was on Ortho TriCyclen Lo but had to stop taking it because it made me so upset within the first days I love this pill I feel like myself on it
9998,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,8,41021,7,I just started my second pack of Lo Loestrin Fe and so far I like it I havent had any noticeable weight gain or acne The first month of pills I did not get a period but I have had minor cramps around period time No spotting either I would prefer to have a period since I do worry about being pregnant but I think this pill is much better to my body than my previous birth controls I will continue this pill Initially I was worried about its effectiveness since its such a low dose but Im glad my body can handle it better Also I took this birth control for a month before taking Beyaz I didnt have a period that month but got regular periods on Beyaz I have heard that not having a period is very common so I dont think I need to worry about it
9999,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,6,41374,14,I have taken the pill for four months The first month was almost continuous light bleeding which wasnt too awful because I was prepared for the first month to be rough After that everything went pretty well I did experience a couple of side effects though I would have two light periods each month The first one what my normal period would be was very light and lasted about three days The second one would be a little heavier and last about five days Cramping was very minimal so that part was good Aside from this I did have some minor breakouts at least compared to how my skin usually is which may or may not have been a side effect It wasnt for me but that doesnt mean it isnt for everyone Hope this helps
10000,Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,7,41374,4,I was on this birth control for months The first months I was moody with little to no weight gain Sex drive decreases only little But in month I started having horrific cystic acne Its so bad I dont want to go out of my house Ive never had cystic acne and now at age it is unbearable and painful I am switching to Alesse
