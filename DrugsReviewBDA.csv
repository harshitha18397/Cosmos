3,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42304,7,I have been on the shot years and until a month ago never period or even spotting A month ago dark brown blood awful odor amp now I have had a full blown period for days Not sure what to think I have continued the shot all of these years only because of the absent monthly
4,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42303,12,Ive had four shots at this point I was on birth control pills for years due to excessive bleeding and extreme pain Never had a regular period and would have them for over a week with HEAVY bleedingim talking pad and tampon at the same time and it would still overflow The pills only made it worse Since the shot i have had no issues I have gained about pounds but that didnt happen until months in And i quit antidepressants so that could have been why i gained weight After months there is no bleeding and no cramps I almost forget what its like to have a period And to be thruthful my boyfriend cums inside me and has since ive been on the shot Ive had no pregnancy scare or issues at all Its super convenient and easy
5,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42302,4,I had a total of shots I got my first one before leaving the hospital after giving birth to my first and only child I chose it on reccomendation from a friend who loves it I stopped taking it September counting the months I was pregnant I had not had a period in years I finally went to the Doctor since we were taking about having another baby They did an ultrasound and said that the wall of my uterus was pretty thick but nothing was done about it About a week later it finally started May I started spotting then a regular to heavy flow Its is not Oct and I am still bleeding My OB told me the only thing she could do for my is a D and C which I seem to have to keep rescheduling Dont take the shot
7,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42299,6,Im and got this for heavy bleeding Ive always heard that bc makes you gain weight but was NOT expecting what I go I gained lbs from just one shot Sent from my usual to Made me nauseated after I ate anything Had to buy a whole new wardrobe because I couldnt fit anything And my sex drive Omg I felt like a yr old women because I was as dry as a desert and couldnt get wet no matter what It was awful I really really dont suggest this I would much rather have cramps that make me throw up rather than take this shot ever again
8,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42298,2,Im and have been having heavy and painful periods since forever I got my depo shot last month and I spotted yesterday at school I was with my boyfriend but glad i took a good shower that he didnt noticei hope But same thing happened today morning too All thats happening is my head is hurting alittle but it started of brownish to a proper red I really hope its not for long But in terms of weight gain i have been eating alotttt more and my mood is a bit harder to control I wont take the shot anymore ill go for the pill but I would recommend dealing with the cramps and flow unless the doctor says something
9,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42298,5,Im a year old woman I got the shot on August th I have been bleeding since I decided not to continue Yes its effective at making sure you dont get pregnant because you cant have sex Its a double edged sword My face has broken out and I have a very good eating regime and my weight is up and down mostly up
10,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42297,2,Im years old and I got shot in August personally I dont mind it I mean I bleed little bits and random times but Id rather have the blood thats supposed to come out come out and not worry about where its going or staying in my body I have my other injection in November on the nd and Im still wondering if I could take it again The only downside to the injection is that I gained access weight and Im kind of moody
12,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42295,7,First month was awesome Absolutely wonderful Then I started lightly bleeding I just thought it was my period But it has lasted up until now which has been about almost months I will not take the shot again Having your period for months is hard on a girl And on top of that my emotions have been insane Like I am not a cryer I never cry and ever since Ive had the shot watching finding nemo makes me ball And I get pissed at people for nothing Its ridiculous Like I dislike who I have become with the shot
14,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42294,7,I started the Depo shot a year ago Originally I bled for weeks with a few days off After my second shot I bled for weeks and had weeks off of my period Then once my period started up again it never stopped So Ive been bleeding since the end of January which makes almost months that Ive been bleedingspotting with not even one day off There were times when it stopped for a few hours but I guess if it came right back it never actually stopped I didnt gain weight Ive struggled with mild depression anxiety poor appetite fatigue lots of nausea and abdominal pain My last shot was at the end of March Im getting the pill tomorrow to help regulate my hormones Im afraid of all birth control now but I hope this works
16,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42292,8,Im and I went on depo for very heavy bleeding Like so heavy I would go through a super plus tampon and over night pad in less then a hour I had the first shot about a month ago and it was fine a little pain but all shots do and now a month later a got my period much lighter for days which is very long for me then there was a day break and now it started again so in total I have been on my period for days I cant even go to school because the bleeding is very unpredictable its heavy one minute and lighter the next there is also large palm size Clots never had those before and the cramps sent me to the ER thinking I was having an appendix attack I never had cramps this bad before Dont know whats going on but I am not happy
18,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42291,4,I had my st shot on Sept nd I have had nonstop bleeding since Other side effects include extreme fatigue chills headache menstrual cramps almost daily depression and painful urination I want my life back I have made calls to my clinic and cant get past the front desk All I get told is there is nothing they will do about it until after Ive had my rd shot Pleaseif your considering this shot dont do it
22,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42287,5,I got the shot during my week post partum The nurse who I seen highly recommend the depo and said it would be great for me I spotted a few days here and there and finally got my period months later Ive been non stop bleeding super heavy for about days now The blood flow are clots the size of mini golf balls I feel so grouchy and tired Im supposed to go back in for my second shot this month HECK NO never again will I get this injection again Im in day of bleeding now Im constantly having to go to the restroom and change at work Ive been using overnight heavy flow pads since and its not getting any better
24,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42287,2,I had one injection in June after seeing a GP about wanting to try for a baby soon and he suggested I need to take Rubella immunisation and contraceptive He recommended Depo as he suggested it has minimum impact on my body before getting pregnant because its a progesterone only After the visit I found out on the net that the Depo shot can stop my ovulation for up to years I was a mess for a couple of month but after months I felt my cycle were coming back and after month before I even got a regular period back I fell pregnant Now we have a very healthy and happy year old It is effective as a contraceptive and Im now feel happy for what happened because I had a chronic anemia before but it got better while pregnant
25,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42332,2,I was on depo provera from the ages of Pros not pregnant no periods at all Cons I gained pounds I couldnt get lubricated for sex very easily My breasts lost sensitivity When coming off of depo provera in hopes to stop steadily gaining weight I had sexual dreams where I would actually orgasm and they were so painful I would wake up It felt like my uterus was being crushed and this pain would last anywhere from minutes to an hour When I told my doctor of this problem she looked at me like I was crazy The benefits do not make up for the horrible side effects I experienced Not recommended
28,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42331,17,I got this shot about and a half months ago I have not stopped bleeding spotting from the first day i got it not even for a day Im a surgeons first nurse so im on my feet all day and every now and again i get cramps along with it My Dr did tell me that the irregularities would be stopping after another dose or which mean i would have to wait about months to some see dry panties NO
29,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42330,26,I got the depo shot in the later part of September October I didnt have a period Comes November the th I had a brown discharge the second week it was my period and now I am still spotting days later I see why you have a quotdecreased sex drivequot you cant have sex Im definitely not getting my second shot Would I recommend this to anyone Ummmm NO
30,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometrial Hyperplasia Prophylaxis,9,42327,6,I had hyperplasia last year as well as endometriosis which I had surgery for First I was prescribed the prometrium pills Had great effects Stopped taking that and was irregular again Then I started bleeding and didnt stop for days and it was heavy We decided on the shot because I wanted added birth control I suffer from bipolar disorder and anything with estrogen is horrid days after the shot I stopped bleeding Some mild cramping a bit moody and weird dreams but overall great I think it works best if you are lacking progesterone
31,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42327,0,Im currently on the depo shot I had my baby in August and started the shot in Mid September Since then I have been bleeding non stop everyday Thats s lot of sanitary products to keep purchasing I also gained weight and it looks like Im pregnant again I was losing the pregnancy weight before taking the shot So far I gained lbs You have no sex lids because your constantly spotting and bleeding I WOULD NOT recommend this method
34,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42326,3,Will never ever ever ever get back on this Caused HORRIBLE depression terrible weight gain and basically got every side effect this drug can cause Wouldnt wish this drug on my worst friend AND it effects your fertility for up to a year which I wasnt told Good thing Im trying to have a baby now
35,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42326,0,You think that getting a shot is going to make your life easy yea right I am years old and had been on the pill for years due to my high blood pressure they put me on the shot go figure I got a shot on May I weighed lb mind you I am tall quot I had no real side effects come for the next shot I was a ten pound increase I dont eat junk food I got horrible headaches stomach cramps and horrible mood swings mostly anger Now here into Nov and I am and have pregant belly and no period since the May Do not do it
37,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42326,1,I got one dose of the Depo shot May Two months after getting the shot I had spotting here amp there Its November now amp for the past months Ive had spotting almost everyday painful sex no sex drive fatigue always hungry amp Ive gained weight like crazy I get irritated very easily amp get mood swings Lately Ive been bleeding heavily its annoying I have an appointment in months to see whats going on amp I was told the depo shot isnt suppose to stop your periods until nd or rd shot The only reason I got the depo was because my period was horrible it was heavy the whole time amp the cramps were unbearable I most definitely DONT recommend the Depo shot
38,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,42325,14,Ive been on depo for almost two years now and have not had a period since i got the injection i no longer have the debilitating cramps that i would get each month which is a godsend after im first given the shot i have about days of being a little more emotional than usual but its usually due to my hormones being balanced and changing a little but it just means a bit of crying and basically how i used to be emotionally before a period i have noticed that some nights i wake up with a really extreme cramp out of nowhere but i believe that that might be an issue thats more to due with my hormone levels etc either way depo has definitely spared me from weeks spent in bed because of the painful cramps
39,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42324,25,Hate it never getting another shot Ive had two and Im not getting my next one Im continuously spotting then bleeding and when I have sex theres no sex drive like I have to force myself to do it I hate it never again
41,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42323,6,I used the depo injection for years and loved it After years is when I experienced the side of effects My period went from days days to constant bleeding I didnt want any more kids so went through a procedure that took care of my issue Overall I was very happy with the injection
42,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42323,3,I was told by my provider this was a great option since Im horrible with taking pills I wanted to lose weight and I didnt want a period so I got it Ive been on it months and I havent stopped bleeding for days today HUGE clots started coming out and the cramps Omg theyre terrible Ive been so deppressed and have had no sex drive I will never use this form of birth control again Ive been eating paleo for a week and am pretty sure Im heavier then when I ate junk food I do not recommend at all
44,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42322,15,I received the depo shot right after I had essure surgery to block my tubes in I got my period about two weeks later and I never stopped bleeding for months I saw my doctor and she put me on hormone therapy did a DampC and I still continued to bleed By this time I was going through pads every hour I had to get up at night and change the bed sheets I was sent to the lab to have my blood drawn My red blood cell count was at Normal count for an adult woman is I was sent immediately to the hospital where I had two blood transfusions and a hysterectomy To this day my doctor doesnt know why I bled so much I keep telling her it was the depo shot and she continues to say I dont think that was it Dont Get the shot
45,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42322,12,So I just got my first depo shot today November Reading everyones experiences amp starting to freak out a little Hope I have an excellent one Only thing bothering me is the injection spot is sore Thats normal but I will definitely be posting updates so far so good
46,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42321,4,Ive taken shots so far and overall have had a very positive experience I had preeclampsia with both my babies so after my week pp visit my OB was concerned that taking the pill may affect and raise my blood pressure After the first shot I had an irregular period and bled off and on very lightly for about weeks After that I have not gotten it again and its awesome by the way The only other side effects that I have had besides the initial irregular bleeding is mild cramping off and on and I can see a difference in my temper I have definitely had some mood swings Overall it is working great for me and I would recommend giving it a shot pun intended
47,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42321,7,At first when I took the shot my life was good Just recently oct th I was due for another one weeks before the th I started to spot Ok I though because I was due soon It is now Nov th and still bleeding Due for another shot Dec I am so over it It will spot for awhile and then get heavy for about minutes I am so disgusted
52,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42374,5,I have had nothing but a great experience on this contraception Ive been on it for years with no side effects The pill was too cumbersome for me as I would forget or take late so the depo was the alternative I have never had a period when on it and will stay on it for that reason alone
55,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42373,5,So Ive been on depo provera for about a year and two months and there is positives to it but then there is also the negatives The first time I got the shot I bled for two months but its gotten lighter each shot and getting shorter for spotting and the periods going from two months to weeks Everytime I get the shot my period disappears for a while and then spotting will happen Im giving it a couple more times and if the periods dont die down then well Im stopping PostivesPeriods are getting shorter and I dont really have to worry till it gets close to my shotNo weight gain actually only a couple poundsNo cramps at allThe negativesWhen the periods start moodiness is horriblePeriod starting Spotting Tiny bit of bloating
58,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42371,13,I got on the shot July th Two weeks after I got the shot I had my period and it has been six months of me bleeding nonstop I would bleed heavy some days and light other days but not once have I went a day without bleeding Doctor keeps telling me its normal and I know it cant be My back hurts so bad sometimes I cant stand straight and these contractions I mean cramps are worse than my pregnancy Im an excercizing maniac and I still can not get rid of my lower stomach and I have a personal trainer Refuse to do the third shot
59,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42368,9,I got the shot and never stopped bleedingdischarging the entire months I was on it I refused to take the nd shot and after about a week after I was supposed to get it the bleeding started again I figured it was my normal period trying to kick back in but I continue to bleed to this day Itll be ridiculously heavy for a week then barely nothing for a few days then itll be ridiculously heavy again I got it in August and Im sure its the reason for why Ive been bleeding consistently for this last past month My period has never been irregular or anything Im so aggravated I feel disgusting and I cant enjoy everyday things without having to worry about whether or not Im gonna be bleeding through everything
60,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42366,4,I was told that I had to get two shots or else it could be potentially dangerous to be taken off of the shot Three months later and a ton of anxiety attacks and bleeding Im in the office going back on my pill The worst thing I couldve ever possibly done to myself was this shot
61,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42365,3,Depo shot I want to start of by saying that I know birth control affects everyone differently But I also feel that many girls arent truly warned about the side affects Before receiving the month depo shot I had to sign a form for bone loss But I did not have to sign a form about all the side effects that plagued me while on this shot and for months after An hour after receiving the depot shot I experienced my first panic attack Extreme fear nausea choking sweating all out of nowhere Then it happened again several hours later I took the shot only once Its been six months since I received the shot and Im now having another panic attack No one actually tells you that the depot shot remains in your system for up to months This doesnt even come close to the worst of it A month after my depo shot I started my period My period went from July to October NONSTOP Continual flow every day for five months It finally stopped when I ate a bunch of fresh ground flax seeds they have estrogen in them which helps repair uterine lining depo is progesterone which thins the uterine lining I only received one shot and my life has been affected for six months and counting Its amazing that my relationship survived the depot shot I hadhave an amazing man by my side who knew none of this was my fault and supported me the whole way But I truly could not have judged him if he left depo was horrible for our relationship Please please decide if these risks are worth it before you take this shot You cant remove it from your body but you can stop taking the pill if you react negatively
62,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42365,1,Im I started depo in April I was bleeding off and on big blood clots and I didnt take the second one Now its December I stop bleeding then it started again but now Im light bleeding and I only took depo shot
63,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42362,4,Very effective for birth control But the side effects are bled for two weeks non stop Going through depression horrible mood swings Would not recommend or reuse This is my first time getting it amp my last
66,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42359,17,I first got the shot back in September everything was fine I loved it no period It was awesome But at the end of November spotting started happening every day Different colors sometimes very heavy and then light clotted and here recently it has been going back and forth from a dark brown to a purple color and I do mean purple I have not gained any weight on this shot Ive actually lost pounds since October Reading other reviews I will not be going back for my second shot
67,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42358,8,weeks after giving birth to my son I chose to get depo I been bleeding on and off for months quot IM SO OVER THIS quot my side effects are being moody at times and Im losing my hair ladys your not the only one You have the right to switch up on your birth control
68,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42357,4,I am now part way through my rd shot of this injection Im and have had pretty much constant bleeding for the past months with only a few weeks of no bleeding I feel shattered constantly and have no energy The main way that its protected me from pregnancy is that I havent been able to even have sex due to constant bleeding This experience has been a nightmare for me its been painful and Ive felt rough and low the whole time I wouldnt recommend this at all as any side effects last for the months that it stays in your system
69,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42356,11,First time trying the shot I got the shot in September and everything was fine I have never had regular periods as far as coming when they should So I thought I would never have a period again November th comes around and Im spotting On the th my period comes I have been spotting different colors also Not to mention the stomach and back pains This whole process has been going on for weeks I know the pill gives you regular monthly periods which is something Id rather deal with Cant wait to switch back to the pill No nd shot for me
71,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42355,0,This shot was great the first month The second and third month I bled the entire time Im on day of continuous bleeding
72,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42355,0,I have been on the depo shot for about years now It has been amazing not having a period for years no cramps spotting or anything After I got my first shot I did have my period for a few months and it was heavy Once that passed I never had a period again I would really recommend the shot to anyone Downsides it costs me about every three months because my insurance doesnt cover it it also may have caused me to gain weight but I cant be sure of that
74,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42353,5,I had to write a review because most people go out of there way only to write one after a bad reaction but everyone is different I used depo for FIVE years and loved it Skin was perfect never gained weight in fact it seemed like I almost couldnt gain weight haha and my emotions were totally level I never had a period either Because it can effect your bone density I decided to switch to another birth control HATED my life I gained weight had chronic fatigue quotmorning sicknessquot severe depression This was from nexplanon I have since been off birth control and regulating my body Before I was on depo I took the pill which made me so sick everyday now that Im in a relationship Im returning to depo
77,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42319,2,Have been on depo for probably around years since I was I chose the injection for convience and to help with my periods as they are heavy and extremely painful often making me vomit from excessive pain First year of being on depo was ok would still always spot and would always get a period before my months was up I swapped backw to the pill for two months then went back to the depo because I was forgetting to take my pill and did want to risk pregnancy Going back onto the injection was the worst decision I could have made I have been back on it for at least months and I bleed after months for about weeks and currently I have been bleeding for over months Never getting this shot again
78,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42319,2,The shot was my first experience and method of birth control I was scared the most of the weight gain more then anything else After reading reviews on different birth controls and peoples experiences with it I couldnt bare the fact of gaining so much weight After having the shot gaining weight wasnt an issue with me i actually lost weight it was my hormones and emotions were crazy For months my mood swings were unbarreable It ruined relationships with me and my boyfriend It made me very depressed and sad causing me to major outbreaks Now that I am off it i feel so much more calm and like myself Worst months of my life The only good thing was my nauesa wasnt too bad and i only got my period twice
80,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42317,6,I had gone to my obgyn for my week postpartum check up She discussed the different options for birth control Since I am Breast feeding I wanted to make sure I chose an estrogen free method So the depo shot would do I thought since its good for months After the first weeks of being on the shot I started spotting for weeks and then the bleeding got heavier and heavier I also felt like I was getting weaker and feeling more tired than ever I would not recommend the depo shot and Im going to just take the pill next time around
81,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42317,4,Took the shot for three years and it was horrible I started taking the depo shot for veey heavy bleesing The firat shot worked amazing and stopped the bleeding after about ten minutes taking it But it all went down hill from there I would bleed for months until it was time to take the shot again then I would stop for two weeks and it would start all over again Now I have two kids and I tried the shot again since your body changes every time you have a baby Well nothing has changed so I called my OB office and am now switching to a different type of BC I do not recommend this depo shot for anyone
82,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42316,19,Depo stopped my period when I got my first shot Almost a week later I started spotting I had been consistently spotting for about three weeks Then I just started bleeding more It wasnt bad but its progressively gotten heavier with large clots Been over days now Ive had headaches acne increased appetite no sex drive painful sex fatigue chills abnormal bleeding Worse decision Ive ever made
83,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42316,4,I started the shot in th grade before high school Im now a junior and considering a different method I was pounds for a few years before I started Now Im and still climbing The hormones make me feel hungry all the time Joining a fitness club for a year did not help either I feel moody often and sad It did a great job of protecting me and preventing pregnancy I barely have a period and when it does come it seems to be off and on for about weeks For anyone considering this just be careful of what you eat and make sure your already exercising Dont listen to your brain telling you that your hungry listen to your stomach
84,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42314,8,Got my first shot May it didnt seem to make me feel funny etc In early July I had my first period the cramps were so bad I left work early August I started my period August th i got my shot still bleeding to this day Its been almost months and I am still bleeding It sucks My sex drive is completely gone No wonder its effective constsntly bleeding and guys disgust you lol I do not recommend this product but each woman is different Im also going to try Mirena if the bleeding ever stops
85,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42313,7,I dont recommend this shot to any female whatsoever its the worst thing you could do to yourself Im years old amp Ive been on the shot for about years now Im not using the shot had actual birth control just for controlling my period amp the awful cramping I would get When I first got my shot I was bleeding for a few months straight but then I never got a period AGAIN Two days ago I was laying in bed when I got God awful cramps amp I know these cramps for anywhere Im bleeding a bit which is reddish brown but only when I wipe amp these cramps are horrible My mood swings have been terrible with this shot amp the weight gain is ridiculous I wont be getting my next shot in January its not worth it I hope the cramps stop soon
86,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42313,11,I got my first shot Aug I started bleeding Aug its lasted for two weeks then I was off two weeks Then I started bleeding September th and I didnt stop bleeding until I got my nd shot Oct BESIDES the bleeding it is very good on birth control I read a lot of experiences on how woman got their first shot and bled a lot and didnt go back to get the next one My doctor told me that will make you bleed even more in making the decision to get the shot be aware you might bleed a little more than usual but in due time around the nd or rd shot you will stop bleeding period I havent bled since I got the nd shot and Im hoping it stays this way
87,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42313,3,I was on depo for only a few months I will say your better off being pregnant You feel every symptom of pregnancy and even get a prego tummy Seriously everyone asks me if I am pregnant Its so embarrassing The symptoms are the worst Ive had the worst acne break out Pains in my stomach I cant stop gaining weight in my stomach Good news is it does prevent pregnancy but its honestly not worth everything you go through Like those weird medications that say you may die but its effective All I am saying is depo will change your life and in a not so lucky way I would have rather of just been pregnant Instead I look and feel pregnant with no baby Mind you I am a skinny person very petite its extremely noticeable
88,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42311,8,My experience with Depo has been wonderful I had horrible cramps and long heavy periods before I started the shot After about months I stopped having a period at all which was great No surprises Also I lost about pounds on it I was previously on ortho tri cyclin lofe The pills made me gain weight the weight loss without trying was fabulous I dont feel tired or achey The only negative was I have had some acne return its nothing that a touch of makeup cant fix But from having blemish free skin to a few pimples is a little annoying I will continue to stay on the shot until I decided to start thinking about having kids Until then Ill deal with a couple pimples and enjoy my skinny period free life
89,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42311,4,Depo shot EASY FORGET ABOUT THE PILL I started the depo provers shot after having two kids birthed one year one day apart Both times I was on the full pill Was easy price is every three months on health care card Wasnt a stressful process was easy pain free I did bleed the first injection out of the weeks I bled heavily but after second shot I have overcome that and I am extremely happy in the success of this needle Its not costly it doesnt hurt its once every weeks dont need to stress about babies and pregnancy people are different some will bleed some wont Yes a tad weight gain but hey weight is better then an unwanted pregnancy
91,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42310,2,I have been getting the depot for years I absolutely love it I have never had a period or spotting in this time I no longet get cramps i dont crave junk food or sook at that time of the month It is completely hassle free My partner has noticed good changes in my moods I have put on a couple of kilos but i also have thyroid issues Every months i go to my doctor for mins to get a needle and a brief check up and im on my way again Its absolutely amazing I wouldmt use anything else
92,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42309,12,Ive had it and I have break through bleeding here and there very light but lasts for a while Ive noticed a slight shift in mood and I havent brook out as much Still cramps around period time but rarely bleed but my sex drive has depleted completely I hate it Excellent at preventing pregnancy but thats only because you lack the motivation for sex
93,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42309,15,After I had my baby my Dr Suggest that I get on birth control the depot is earlier to take every months So I decided go with that birth control method I got the depot shot Sept th come Oct I get on my period its an irregular period I usually bleed for to days Now I bleed heavier amp longer its been days amp counting Im not due Dec th for another shot Im definitely not continuing this depot shot I been depressed very emotional moody and my attitude has changed since I been on this shot I constantly argue with my boyfriend This shot have a lot of bad side effects but I havent been feeling like my normal self since I been on this shot I wouldnt recommend this shot anyone please go with other options
94,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42307,6,I got the shot at my first weeks check up after I had my baby and I bled months straight it finally stopped and then every other month I will bleed heavy for a few days and it continues on and on I have gained so much weight off of this shot it just makes my body feel funny I wont be continuing this shot Dont take the shot
95,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42307,11,I took this birth control about a month ago and at first I loved it I was spotting for about a week after I got it and then I stopped for maybe a month days ago I started spotting a brown color period blood No its very prominent heavy and red Ive been on this period for days now and Im sick of it Im very moody and ALWAYS hungry Always tired and always have headaches Im never irritable and this is not me Ive gained pounds And yeah this medicine helps prevent pregnancy but only because you cant have Sex Your always bleeding an moody Who wants to have sex under those predicaments I would never recommend this medicine to anyone An I sure am never ever getting it again
96,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42307,31,So my doctor prescribed me provera mg for days amp it completely stopped the bleeding thank god days later i got my peeiod with the worse cramps ever and i was bleeding really heavy with lots of bloods clots It was so uncomfortable
99,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42305,0,I decided to start taking the birth control shot after the birth of my son I figured it would be worth the convenience of getting the shot every months and not having to remember to take a pill Ever since Ive started getting the injections my side affects has been SEVERE mood swings DECREASE in my libido cramping and nausea Ive never liked the idea of not having a regular cycle however taking birth control does alter your menstrual cycle Im going to have to consider other options for birth control I cant deal with my severe mood swings Im starting to lash out against my family and it hurts Im a young year old and my sex drive has gone completely down hill
100,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42233,2,Depo was not for me but that does not mean it wont work for you It definitely did its job preventing pregnancy I was told the shot lasted months After my three months I didnt go back to get another shot because my husband and I wanted to have a baby It didnt happen for over a year AFTER those three months passed We had another child so it wasnt because Im not fertile I was also suicidal after getting depo Not your average depressed but actually suicidal and so crazy depressed that I wanted to die and had no clue why I lost a lot of hair when I would brush it I didnt gain weight My worst side effect was the depression It was unbearable to the point that I almost took my own life But it surely can prevent pregnancy
101,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42231,17,Ive been on this medicine for years now and have not had any negative side effects For those of you reading this you shouldnt let somebody elses review determine what her or not you take this medicine that should be decided after a long talk between you and your doctor Every bodys body is different so these reviews can not give a completely accurate description of whats going to happen to your body Im my experience I had irregular bleeding for about months but that is the time it took my body to adjust to the medication If you have irregular or constant bleeding for more than six months which is two cycles of the medication then you may want to talk to your doctor because the medication might not be the right one for you
102,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42230,5,I have had no negative side effects wit this birth control I have tried about ten different kinds of birth control pills before trying Depo and all of the pills made me an emotional mess I have no complaints about Depo I didnt gain weight no periods no crazy emotions
103,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42230,7,I didnt get pregnant which is the only reason Im rating this a I have been bleeding for days straight as of today Since I got the shot I have experienced severe fatigue hour long headaches appetite issues inability to get out of bed and horrible cystic acne
104,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,42229,18,I have been on the shot for almost two months and I absolutely hate it When I got the shot I was actually due for my period and never got it I ended up getting my period about weeks ago and have not stopped bleeding I can not have sex I cant wear white pants because its so heavy I cant go to the bathroom number or number because it hurts so bad I have had horrible cramps I dont sleep Im exhausted all the time and I am constantly feeling grumpy At this point I almost feel like nothing is going to help my endometeriosis Im years old and due to be married in a month and I cant even have sex because it hurts so bad I would not recamend this shot its a waste of time and causes false hope
106,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42226,1,Ive been on the shot for about a year now and i absolutely hate it Ive gained so much weight and were talking like lbs Its like i cant stop eating My cravings are absolutely horrible Im always hungry I work out here and there but i cant seem to lose the weight Im years old This birth control method is not something i would suggest to anyone except for the fact that it is very effective against pregnancy
107,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42226,1,So Ive been going back and forth between Sprintec and Depo for the last year I was on Sprintec from the age of because of horrible cramping I loved the pill but could never remember to take it so I was on my period all of the time I tried depo I dont really remember the first time taking it except for having some vaginal dryness and I lost my boobs at years old not the most exciting combination So I got back on the pill same issues of forgetting to take it and went back to depo for some reason I cant explain to myself It was a horrible decision My mood swings are ridiculous my anger is out of control Im constantly bloated Ive become very constipated spotting comes out of no where and Im constantly exhausted
108,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42226,10,Ive been on the depo two times now The first time started in and I took it for years I had no problems at all with it Then in February I decided to get back on it and the first shot went good until towards the end of it and I started spotting Didnt think to much of it since I had been off it for a few months I thought it was just normal Got my second shot in may It has been a terrible experience Ive bled literally the whole months Me and my boyfriend cant have sex because that just makes it worse My sex drive has plummeted Im due for another shot sometime this month Not gonna get it I actually have a dr Appt tomorrow regarding the bleeding I Dont recommend No one should have to go thru this
110,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42225,24,This was awful I got my first shot at UVA two days after my first baby was born They pushed it in me and didnt mention any side effects Stopped bleeding from giving birth three weeks later After about a week it started again and hasnt stopped I got a second shot because they told me that can happen from my body getting used to the hormones But I never went back for my third Over six months later Im still bleeding almost a month after I shouldve gone in for a third shot I dont know what to do Its exhausting Im constantly tired moody and depressed and I want to eat everything in sight I wouldnt recommend this method of birth control for anyone
111,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,42225,33,First time I took Provera it worked great for years and made me regular I had gone to the ER for heavy bleeding and clotting nd time I went to the ER was earlier this year for same reason Provera slowed it down passed clots and then I spotted here and there Just recently mid July I started having heavy bleeding again and the docs couldnt give me answers as to why but put me on Provera again Didnt do anything this time It slowed it down on DayDay on it and then after and especially when I finished Provera I was bleeding very heavily The doc said thats to be expected and have to wait it out and just wait for my ultrasound Im so sick of all this bleeding and even more so not getting any answerstreatment
112,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42224,23,I took depo in January while I was on my period After my period stopped like a few days laterIi started spotting and it never stopped I told the doctor but they insisted that it was a good method so I took it again and scheduled the next shot The spotting never stopped I had a terrible appetite my moods were changing like I never went back to get the third shot I regret ever taking depo I feel like Im never going to have my regular menstrual cycle or have the sex I had before or stop using pantie liners This is very frustrating
113,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,6,42223,12,Im and was prescribed provera because on August of this month will be months I havent had my period I have been reading about it like crazy My test results came back normal Can someone tell me that after the th day on the pill I will get my period I have severe headaches and bloating
114,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42223,24,I found this site and comments of great interest My daughter had a shot earlier this year and complained of continuous bleeding not spotting feeling bloated nausea headaches cramps and very depressed and emotional She went other doctor who has put her on antidepressants and pills to supposedly stop the bleeding a week on still bleeding My daughter is and has changed from a lovely bubbly happy person into an ill zombie who sits on the sofa all day fatigued and in pain I certainly intend to seek legal advice
115,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42222,5,I have had injections and am discontinuing the drug after months In my opinion it is just not worth it I experienced extreme nausea for or days within the first months of getting the injection My periods came early and lasted week I had many anxiety episodes and mood swings Nearing the time of my second injection I experienced extremely heavy bleeding for days Im talking new super tampons every hours with a regular pad for inevitable leaks and even fainted during this time months later and most of my symptoms have gone but Ive had my period since my second injection over months ago At least it has been effective in preventing pregnancy the combination of these symptoms leave me with no desire for sex
116,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,7,42222,9,Hi Im years old and ever since Ive had my first period its been irregular Ive even been up to months without it Its my first time with provera I got my period two days after days of taking the pill The only side effects that I have had are that Ive sort of had hair loss and frequent headaches Other than that Ive always had PMS
117,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42219,8,Worst thing ever Effective yes but destroy ladies body especially when you stop using it I would never recommend it I wish I had never taken it I took shots yet it was enough to mess up my whole cycle Uncontrolled bleeding Unaware when to expect blood or not Z percent bad
118,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42219,51,If I could give this shot rating I would Lets start with Ive always had a normal period before this unexplained side effect of a shot This shot was administer to me in April and I didnt stop bleeding until July st After doing my own research and taking matters into my own hands it has finally stopped I went to the doctor countless of times trying to figure out how to stop the bleeding I took BLACKSTRAP MOLASSES if I could type that in bold letters and in a bigger font I would When I tell you on the first day of taking it the bleeding was much lighter and on the th day it was gone All I took was one tablespoon daily
119,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42217,56,I was bleeding heavily for a month with extremely large blood clots that made it difficult and stressful to even leave the house It was seriously affecting my quality of life and emotional well being My Dr prescribed Provera mg twice a day for ten days After the second dose the blood clots had completely disappeared By the third dose no bleeding at all This medicine was like a miracle for me I am happy to have my life back I noticed I am having a headache but its not that bad Ill take a headache any day over the suffering I endured with that excessive bleedingclotting
120,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42217,8,Ive been on Depo twice First time I was on it for about years and now Im on it again and its been months The first time I was on it absolutely loved it No horrible side effects This second round though I have gained some weight which is no biggie because I do like my bigger butt lol I think Depo is awesome and its really convenient and easy
121,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42216,1,Ive been taking depoprovera since May I havent had a period since but very light spotting from time to time This my rd year on birth control and after my last shot on July Ive been bleeding uncontrollably I dont know whats wrong but its literally making me feel sick Light headed due to low iron I dont know if I should stay on it or not
122,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42211,1,Well Ive been taking depo for over a year now since I had my first child I took my last shot in April and Ive decided not to take another shot because of all the bleeding Ive been doing I was supposed to take another shot on July th but didnt and that didnt seem to help because Im still bleeding like crazy I have been bleeding for almost month Its crazy
123,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42211,10,After the birth of our son my husband and I decided that the shot would be our best option Didnt have to take a pill every day and no periodsSo on July I had my first shot I began soaking through to tampons daily I was hospitalized for that and once again for a fainting episode due to anemiaI never went back for my second shot It is now just over a year later I am still bleeding My husband and I havent had sex for a year because of the intensity of the pain and bleedingI have tried everything from soy isoflavones to ibuprofen and iron to estrogen therapy to other forms of birth controlThey say I have to let it wear off but its so bad that I have trouble caring for my child because of fatigue
124,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42210,14,I have bled for months straight since I took a shot of depo provera I started bleeding weeks after for months I have finished over tablets of tanxeric acid to help stop the bleeding at different times The bleeding reduces when am on the tablet and continues after days I regret ever taking depo provera Am still praying for the bleeding to stop I know am at the last stages before the side effect completely leaves my body more month to make it months if it continues I will look for any available option to completely stop it My Doctor didnt tell me the side effects before I took the shot Ive been on iron every day for months I also take multivitamin and vitamin C This is a horrible experience for meNEVER AGAIN
126,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42350,19,So I get on this shot to control my bleeding since I was going on vacation and I didnt want to be on my period while on vacation I was so crazy to get on this shot because my tubes are tied but my period was out of control so I got on the shot Why did I do this to myself I took my first shot on started bleeding I kept bleeding so I called the doctor to ask her what to do she said to take ibuprofen pills times a day and it should slow it down Nope never stopped so I decided to get another shot What was I thinking doing that To this day IM STILL BLEEDING SINCE my attitude is thru the roof my marriage is suffering Im depressed cuz Ive gained so much weight I have constant headaches etc
127,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42350,4,Depo was the worst thing I could have done to my body After one shot was horribly moody my skin broke out and I gained weight I never got another one but I bled for months straight and the only way I could stop it was going on the pill DO NOT USE THIS FORM OF CONTRACEPTION
128,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42350,34,I went almost months without a period I shouldve known I was in for trouble but I just let it slide until the day I started my period I bled for weeks non stop It was very heavy with lots of large clots I went to the ER eventually and the Dr prescribed me provera mg for days It was awesome for days almost no bleeding just spotting here and there I came off of provera and days later Im bleeding times worse and a lot more clots then I was before taking the drug Somethings got to give I just want to be able to be normal again
129,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42349,27,I was bleeding large clots nonstop for months I kept going to the ER and they did nothing The last time I went my RBC count was so low I had to have blood transfusions along with surgery I was given Provera to take I have been taking it now for days and the blood is completely gone I am just worried it will come back when the pills are gone
132,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,5,42347,4,I have was dx with endometrosis back in I have had chest tubes surgeries within years I was also dx with catamenial puemothorax which you can google to get more info about but it has a lot to do with my period etc it all goes together But I have been on birth control pills lupron and now on the depo And I must say the only think that helps was the lupron besides of the side effects of hot flashes cold sweats etc But the pill was a no go I didnt like how it made me feel and I have been on the depo shots for a few months but I must say it worked in the st few months but now i have been bleeding for he last months nonstop and I am just stop everything cause Im so over with trying different things its so frustrating
134,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42346,1,My Dr Suggested it after my rd childso I decided to get it I missed the first period After taking the shot but started for the second one Ive been bleeding for a month straight now Its increased my appitite making me gain pounds in monthsIve recently started working out so Ive been trying to loose it Ive never had an acne problem but now my face breaks out terribly too Ive been moody with crazy head aches It is a hormone So obviously its going to have some hormone related side effects Read the pamphlet check out reviews Remember its an injection of hormones into your body doctors dont know exactly what the side effects youll have if you have anybasically youre a human lab rat
135,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42346,6,Ive had shots and go for my rd one the th of this month I never bled when I got my first shot I didnt bleed at all until August I bled for an hour one day and that was it it happened again in September and not again until now I started after I had sex with my boyfriend one night and bled the next day but it quit that night and it wasnt bad I went the next day without bleeding until that night I bled but not much at all Didnt bleed for days and then it came back but it was brownish This has happened the past weeks I know I get my shot in a few days but its never been this irregular But it hasnt made me lose my lose my sex drive at all and I havent gained any weight on it
137,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,2,42345,5,I was recently put on depo provera as a lastditch effort prior to undergoing a full hysterectomy to relieve serious pain from endometriosis While it has been effective for relieving the pain I have been heavily spotting or more for over months now every day I decided not to get another shot and I am now experiencing random horrible stabbing pains in my ovary not like the endometriosis pain Pain aside months of feeling too gross to have sex I feel bad for my husbandI was on depo for years during my younger years and never had any issues I stopped taking it because I thought I was going to be able to have children that turned out to not be the case so I thought it couldnt hurt to try it again bad choice
138,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42345,6,I havent had any serious complications like most of you have Ive only had slight weight gain very headaches and just irregular spotting that would go away within a couple of days of start My sex drive is the same I love the fact that I dont have periods Everyone is different Id recommend it
139,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42344,3,I recently had child number two at age so I dicided to try a new for of birth control was on the pill for two years but got pregnant on it so I got the shot on November and started bleeding on December and it now December and I am still bleeding I am a bit worried seeing that its my first time on the shot I have a little mood swing and lost of energy and lost of appetite I dont think I will get another shot if the bleeding doesnt stop soon and the cramps r painful I got the shot cause I was told there would be no period and I am still bleeding
140,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42342,5,Ever since I took this shot I have been having extreme shooting pains up my arm and terrible headaches I am really scared and have been bleeding for three weeks straight I would give anything to have never taken this shot right now
141,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42342,21,I recieved my second shot at the beginning of November I had been bleeding constantly for almost weeks beforehand and have continued to bleed every day since I despise wearing a pad as I find them unsanitary and smelly but not quite enough blood to warrant a tampon Enough to make walking running amp standing uncomfortable and sex is absolutely out if the question
143,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42340,4,Ive been on depo for about years nowPROs depo is convenient and prevents pregnancy from what I read I know I havent gotten pregnant while being on it Also I have had blood clots in past so it was a good alternative to the pill which can cause blood clotsCONs spotting ALL the time As I was reading this I just realizedremembered that my Dr told me to prevent this the Dr can alter the dose of the medicine so if this is an issue for you please talk with your doctor and dont be lazy like me libido definitely has gone down if youre on it for over years it can really negatively affect your bone density Im getting off of it for this reason
144,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42339,3,While the irregular periods frequent spotting and slightly heavier periods are a drag the shot has worked very well for me It is very effective at preventing pregnancy and is lowmaintenance All you need to worry about is getting the shot every monthsMy periods werent bad before the shot and theyve stayed exactly the same besides being unpredictable Just have to worry about changing my padtampon No bad cramps same amount of acne as usual and no side effects to speak ofIm only on my th month of the shot now and Ive heard that after months the periods typically become more predictable at least and less blood is shed from spotting Quite a few women stop having their periods actually which is what Im hoping for
148,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42335,3,I started taking the Depo shot when I was however it did help effectively with me not getting pregnant and I did not have any periods for four years but it caused me to have crazy mood swings insane depression and made me feel down all the time I switched to the birth control pill now that Im and I dont feel like Im going completely crazy now So I do not recommend this birth control at ALL
151,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42274,12,Im reading all these reviews and Im puzzled Ive been on Depo for nearly years with a few breaks and this month is the first time Ive ever even spotted Ive never had a period or cramping the rest of the time Ive been on it I do think its attributed to some minor weight gain Im actually wondering if there was a bad batch of this out out within the last year considering all these reviews about bleeding are so recent
152,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42272,17,I started DepoProvera in July of One month after I started spotting then bleeding heavily Its now almost months and Im still bleeding I was very worried that it couldve caused some other problem until I read the reviews and realized that other women are experiencing the same problem Please stay away from this drug
153,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42270,1,Im years old and feet tall pounds In August I had the Depo Shot worst decision ever A year later and I gained poundsWhen I was in middle school I was pounds as well but in high school I dropped a lot of weight and was in the most of the time until I got the depo shot I have tried my regular ways of losing weight exercising dieting meal replacements HCG diet and also Insanity These all worked previously for me but not nowI started Isagenix and Im optimistic because I have friends that all used this product and lost weight I think it might work on me too despite of the Depo Shot
156,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,7,42269,24,I hate this medicine Took for days and did get my period the last day st day was light but since than its been cramps that I can barely move amp heavy heavy bleeding On day and in the last hrs Ive leaked xs Once was in an hr period from the last leak It causes your period but be warned it can be horrible Was told to expect heavy but this is rediculous right now On top of everything Im amp having hot flashes from side effects massive headaches while taking the meds and pms which I never have
159,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42266,35,This stops the bleeding I have been bleeding heavy for weeks This worked and i actually feel better Happier and more energetic
160,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42265,19,I am years old and i gave birth April to my beautiful daughter I got the depo shot and havent stopped bleeding since It has days when it stops for half the day but doesnt completely go away and all of a sudden I started having brown stuff come out Idk what that means but lets hope it means its going away for good Never getting any birth control again Too many side affects
161,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42265,5,I received my injection on July I was on my last day of my period and since then I have only had mild spotting I experienced some pain on the injection site that went away after a couple days to a week Very few mood swings I gained six pounds since then I am considering not going in for the second injection because I fear I will gain more weight and have worse side effects Also you are expected to take calcium supplements since it sucks the vitamin D andor calcium out of you Which is hard for me because if I wanted to take a pill everyday I would have just got that I have had a pleasant experience on depo but I am worried about the future
162,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42264,6,Been on depo for about two years I think maybe two and a half At first it was fine It stopped my periods almost completely with occasional spotting around the time my periods should be But since my last injection Ive gained pounds developed terrible acne and over the past two months have bled every single day Sometimes a little sometimes enough to soak through a tampon in an hour I normally gain pounds on other forms of birth control but with the added in the past few months Ive gained a total of pounds since starting depo Thats crazy Ive always had really clear skin but noticed a significant decline when I first started depo and in the past two months my skin has just gone crazy it looks terrible
163,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42264,15,I got the shot last month to help with my endometriosis I was on my period at the time after my period stopped everything was fine but once I got my period things started to go down hill not by much I started my period and it wasnt so heavy at first and my pain was gone but now Im stuck on my period I have been bleeding for over two weeks now and cramps come and go my face broke out and hasnt stopped which is weird for me because it doesnt ever last this long Im really starting to think its not worth it if Im still on my period all the time because now I feel like I cant do much like swimming or being crazy active because I feel weak and just drained
164,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42263,7,Ive been on it for about months Im supposed to get my next shot but Im not I would rather get my regular cycle back than the depo I had a lightish period for months with a few days every so often that it would stop but start again at night I was told that after months it should stop After a few weeks of month it was still going Finally it stopped for a good month I was so glad I thought it was over I was wrong Ive had a period for months straight again but this time its a regular month long period that hopefully stops I just want to go back to a normal cycle again Ive also been moody impatient gained some weight more acne I wasnt like that before The depo sucks
166,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42261,1,Do not use It did not work as an effective birth control Was successfully on the pill for tears got pregnate on the shot
167,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42260,3,Iv been on depo for years and I can say its better than other birth controls you deffanitly wont get pregnant its probly hard to conceive even after you stop getting it I have gained about lbs mostly always hungry I get acne on an off an have mood swings Im thinking about getting off of it cus I heard it decreases bone mass an putting that in your body for long time cant be healthy
168,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42260,16,I absolutely hate this I have been on depo for months and I have bled the whole time Non stop No breaks Its not light either Its like being on the second day of your period FOREVER It has also significantly worsened my depression I had finally gotten a combo of meds and therapy that had me feeling relatively functional I made the mistake of taking depo It ruined all my progress and has me debating suicide again Ive gained weight and developed acne This sucks dont ever take it Theyll tell you it can stop your periods Dont be deceived
170,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42258,8,My normal periods involved changing a super plus tampon hourlywearing an overnight pad for days then medium flow days severe diarrhea vomiting and extreme bloating and very paining cramps heavy cloting I decided to try this and the first two weeks were great no bleeding or pain then I got my period and it was very light with minimal cramps for one day I was soooo happy I cried One month later Im still bleeding Its super light and I only see light pink blood when I wipe I hope it ends soon going to give it time and a few more shots I dont think anyone should get this shot unless they were in my position with an abnormal heavypainful period I rather have light spotting for months than one week of extreme pain
171,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42258,4,The depo shot was convienent Loved not having to take a pill everyday At first things were fine then I slowely started to develop severe depression all the way to suicidal thoughts And trust me Im the happiest person alive I was so confused what was happeneing I only got shots and then I switched to sprintec pill Within a week of being off the depo I felt like myself again I would rather take pills a day then to feel what I felt on the depo

183,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42245,10,I have PCOS and have done for nearly yrs Periods lucky if I had one a year then started to have irregular bleeds Was sent for biopsy and scan results showed complex focal hyperplasia Gyn but me on provera daily I am now entering my th week of really heavy bleeding and large cots along me depressed tired and ruling my life Was talk of hysterectomy but Im petrified of such a major op any help will be gladly appreciated
185,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42244,2,I was on this method of birth control from age I loved it I never noticed a weight gain no periods at all for this entire time In retrospect that probably isnt healthy but at the time it didnt bother me in the slightest I had pretty intense mood swings but I was also In a very unstable relationship at the time so Im not going to pin the mood swings entirely on the depo I recently switched to Trinessa pills and absolutely hate them I never realized how happy I was with the depo shot until I started something else Im slightly concerned with the long term effects of the shot but I might end up switching back to it I know it has a rep for making people gain crazy weight but it didnt have that effect on me
187,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42243,5,This had been my third time with depo I had taken it twice before after my first two babies and had regular periods and no other side effects So I thought nothing of it when they suggested it after my third born I feel like they always urge me to stop reproducing even after my healthy birth Four weeks to the day after my third birth I was given depo and have not stopped bleeding since Thats over four months of bleeding now I didnt go back for the second shot at three months From yucky dark thick blood to a river there is no stopping it Along with all the joys of being on your period Im moody and depressed I cant even go back to work
188,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42241,5,Experienced abnormal continual bleeding once shot was administered for months Convenient contraceptive after all Also experienced rapid weight gain bloating and fatigue Wouldnt recommend to friends
189,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42241,6,This is a horrible horrible drug I had an pharmacological abortion in November on the same day I was administered a shot of depot provera and was due another one in February I was bleeding for the whole months without stopping Went to GP who send me for a scan to exclude any tissue from termination left in the uterus Everything was clear Blood test was good I refused further depot shots and said I want to have normal periods back It is August now months from the date when I was due another shot and I am still bleeding erratically I do have a bit more bleeding that I think is my period for around weeks and then it stops for days and then spotting returns I am furious and extremely worried
190,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42241,3,I got my very first Depo shot in May and got my period on schedule in June except it lasted for weeks Two weeks after it ended I got my period again July th and have been on it for the past weeks going on Im waiting for it to bleed out but it recently got heavier Ive called around to different offices and theyve said the same thing that I should just get another shot and that irregular bleeding is normal for the first months I was having debilitating cramps in June which Im pretty sure is linked to the shot because Ive never felt that pain before Other than that I havent had cramps at all I did notice that I am extremely angry on this birth control and I started breaking out on my cheeks
191,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42240,14,The depo is different for everyone which I have found out The only reason I got the depo is because it was highly recommended by people who have not experienced periods while on it did not get a period in the first month but the second month was bleeding for a full months and thats been my routine ever since will not be getting the th shot I have spoke to a nurse and both doctor about this and it is considered normal as you need at least in your system to get used to them but I am on the th and no change would not recommend
192,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42240,20,One thing for sure It definitely prevents pregnancy because you cant have sex due to the fact youre constantly bleeding I got my second shot on July th and I have been bleeding ever since with occasional clots and its almost the end of August Its very frustrating and annoying I definitely will not be getting the third shot And the medical facilities that provide the shot have no clue neveragain
193,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42240,3,I was on the depo shot for about a year I loved it I had no periods at all for the year I decided to try to conceive so I stopped getting the shot The month after I was due for my shot I got my period again Two weeks later and Im still bleeding I had very normal periods before the shot always days on time every month Im nervous about my fertility and the constant two weeks of bleeding I just hope it ends soon Im giving the shot an because I had no side effects or periods on the shot and I didnt get pregnant So I guess the birth control did its job
194,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42240,15,I got the shot in June it was great in the beginning I didnt have a period the first month the nd month came around and I got my period amp now its been a month and I am still bleeding I will never again get this shot I have severe cramps long lasting headaches For any woman looking to get on birth control I DO NOT recommend the Depo
195,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42238,9,I got the shot on July nd The day I got the shot I had experienced sharp cramps in my stomach Not even a week later I started bleeding not like my normal light bleeding This lasted for over a month I stopped the heavy bleeding on August th And now I am still bleeding just not as bad This is like a brown slime Its nasty as heck This is the first and last time I will ever get that shot Its ruining my attitude I am never hungry and I am dropping weight like no other Not to mention my sex life I am going in on September th to talk to my doctor about trying something else and to see how we can stop the bleeding once and for all
197,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42236,5,I loved the depo shot I was on it for just under two years and had no problems I used this as my only form of protection since I am in a committed relationship My only slight issue is that I gained alot of weight about pounds My doctor believes this is due to the stress of a new job a promotion And some life changes not the depo I quit the shot in order to confirm its been almost three months and Im still gaining weight so maybe the doctor was right I had no other side affects And no period from the day I started I havent gotten my period back in the last three months I plan to go back on the shot very soon Its the most convenient by far And despite the horror stories Ive never had a problem
198,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42235,6,I had regular periods until suddenly in June my period started and didnt end In July I went to my quottrustedquot family doctor and he assured me that the depo would stop the bleeding When the nurse was about to administer the shot she warned me and said you should get a second opinion I was so desperate and I trusted my family doctor so I decided the get the shot anyway Not only has the bleeding not stopped its worsened It is so bad that when I step out of the shower I have to use it tissue so it doesnt drip on the floor I have been bleeding for months I finally went to my gyno and he said I should never have gotten it in the first place and there is nothing he can do I need to let it bleed out Never again
199,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42235,7,Its a great contraceptive I cant possibly get pregnant Why Because Ive had my period for weeksThis is seriously the worst thing Ive ever had
201,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42285,9,This shot is no goodI gave birth on aug and at the hospital they gave me the depo shot before I was dischargedEverything was regular I was bleeding everything out then my weeks were up and I was still bleeding so I thought it was just my period but its now oct and Im still bleeding its so frustratingNo doctor told me that it made you bleed like crazy and also another nurse told me that this shot stops your breastmilk but no doctor is giving out this information I regret it
202,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42285,4,So glad to find this site and to read Im not the only one who has experienced awful side effects Only had the one injection and bar a couple of weeks in total I have bled the whole time This has been going on for almost months now Starting to affect my relationship Avoid like the plague if all the other reviews are anything to go by
203,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42285,11,I took the depo shot may only because the clinic pms suggested it and said it was covered by insurance and you wouldnt have to pay dollars a month for the prescription of birth control I was like sure this is alright and I took it while I was on my period after I took it it ended immediately and for the first month I was fine and didnt have to worry then I started to get the light spotting and looked up and said it was normal for a bit of spotting after a week it stopped for a day and then went full flow until now October and it stops for a day and comes back full force every now and then I only took the shot once and they said it would last for months I dont know what to do
204,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42285,5,Ive been on the depo for about years Im Its the only contraceptive that I could use because I have a gene in my blood stream that makes me twice as likely to get blood clots then any other person without it I had no issues what so ever being on it I never spotted I never gained weight I had an overall good experience being on it Now Ive been off of it since May I started spotting in August a sign that my body is going back to normal ish My withdrawal symptoms are starting to suck Over the last three days Ive had nothing but severe cramping that I cant function with Today being the third day Im finally experiencing a normal period Which the pain yeah it sucks but its a sign my bodys trying to go back to normal
206,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42283,8,I initially got this shot because I was told that it would completely stop your period Well its been months now and I havent stopped bleeding The first weeks were great then I got my period and havent stopped bleeding Its not a heavy period or anything just consistently light blood brown stuff It has been the most annoying thing ever Not only has that been bad but this shot made me super depressed emotional and moody Im honestly surprised my boyfriend is still with me Lol This has been such a horrible experience and I will definelty not be going back for another shot I cant wait to have my normal period back for just a week each month I will take a week of crampin over this shot anyday I Really wanted to like it
207,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42283,6,Im Ive been on the depo shot for and a half months Im due for my next one in a couple weeks and I really dont want it The first month was fine no side effects and got my period like normal it only lasted me days but the nd month was so bad Terrible back aches cramps mood swings when I first started out I had depression but its worse now to the point where I have suicidal thoughts the worst pain in my bones that wouldnt let me do simple things like bend over to pick something up get out of bed or pick up my nephew and I got my period weeks ago at the end of September and I still have it now in the beginning of October as heavy as ever Im scared about how long its gonna last
208,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42283,24,A few months ago I shared my horrid experience about this drug This drug increased my bleeding folds and continued for months of very heavy bleeding I went to a specialist and he said I should have never been prescribed depo and the effects irreversible and they stay in your body more than months and there is nothing that can be done You can only imagine my despair I did however manage to get in and see another doctor This doctor is my miracle She prescribed me yaz drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets The first days the bleeding increased tremendously but after that it COMPLETELY STOPPED To me this was a miracle I am sharing this hoping that it could bring women in my condition some relief
209,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42283,9,If you have got the depo shot and are now experiencing consistent bleeding thats dark in color I recommend seeing a gyno and getting the pill I bled from May until the end of September and a week after the pill I am blood free All my other side effects have also subsided GET THE PILL IT HELPS I SWEAR
213,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42282,0,Overall I feel the DEPO is excellent About years ago I started bleeding heavily and had an week long period I became anemic so they suggested the DEPO Oh my gosh it was awesome I always had a week long period every months right before I was due for the shot I am and thought I was getting menopause so I took myself off the shot After tests saying I wasnt menopausal I went back on the shot One shot and Ive had periods already with cramps like never before Time for a hysterectomy I think
218,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42278,5,My doctors office set me up with a nurse practitioner to discuss methods to reduce bleeding every month She suggested the Depo shot She felt it would be the answer to all my problems I said well what if I bleed more She assured me that it wouldnt happen if I got the shot on my first day of my period I had looked at reviews and done some research mostly it was negative but I assumed maybe the people leaving reviews were just the people that had a bad experience Since the day I got that shot I have been bleeding heavily like a regular Not spotting The nurse practitioner who recommended the shot would not admit that it was the shot making me bleed continuously It has been a week period and counting Im furious
219,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,5,42277,10,Im and came off the pill months ago after taking it for years Havent had a period for at least a year even when on the pillIm at the rd round of Provera I took it times for days and got no period after the daysNo negative side effects just dry mouthIts almost like I wasnt taking anything One positive thing though it seems to have cleared the skin rashes and fungus I started having a few months after coming off the pillDidnt bring my periods back but solved my skin issues
220,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42277,7,THIS DRUG IS A TOXIC POISON and should be BANNEDI took only one shot on June due to complaining about painful periods due to a fibroid Worst mistake of my life For the first month and a half i didnt have a period which was great Then on August st it started badly I woke up with blood clots the size of golf balls falling out of me and my entire uterine lining all at once like my intestines were falling out I havent stopped bleeding and have even been put on a BC pill acupuncture nothing works I was fainting went to the ER for blood transfusions Still hasnt stopped I pray to god every day to help HELP Ive been hemorrhaging for months now
222,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42276,5,I was on this birth control for month two when I started noticing side effects People say they never get a period I got mine THREE times in the span of a month and a half These were three FULL seven day periods with less than a week break in between I became insanely depressed and had anxiety I could not handle I spent every day crying because my emotions were out of control I contemplated suicide many times but never tried It took MONTHS to get back to some type of normal and even now a year and a few months later I still get AWFUL anxiety during my period and when Im ovulating Prior to the Depo Provera I never had depression or anxiety This was my first time and I pray that this will be my lastWouldnt wish it on an enemy
223,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42276,7,Weight gain mood swings stomach pain none existent libido migraines all this can be yours with a shot of depo
224,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42276,5,Consider something you like Say a favorite breakfast food or a place to go with friends Now think about something you care nothing about say the painted lines on a road or the bottom of your kitchen table Imagine that everything you like instead of being something nice you enjoy becomes as unimportant to you as the bottom of your table Work Favorite nephew Friday night Now you feel nothing either good or bad Thats depo provera Yeah you wont get pregnant but thats because you wont care about sex or your mate or anything Most awful weeks ever Good news though you wont care about your three month period either Or the enormous blood clots Or the long term damage like bone density loss and anemia
226,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42180,7,Do not get the shot I got the shot a while ago at first everything was alright but then I got my period which Ive had forever now it will not go away I get the worst headaches that Ive ever had before and they last all day and I get them everyday I feel sick And I also have started to feel super moody and sad out of no where My body gets achey and I am starting to gain weight definitely will not be getting the shot again its not worth it
227,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42180,7,This depo shot has been the best for me I have been on it a long time and I have had no side effects from it I feel full all the time and no pregnancy scares its really good
228,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42180,26,Warning Unless do you want your life turned completely upside down do not take this form of birth control I have been bleeding for months now Constant bleeding no breaks in between whatsoever Do not believe when the doctor tells you after your second or third shot itll stop It wont Ive had more than numerous tests done everythings normal Ive been to a specialist twice Everyone saids your body has to go back to normal on its own which could take up to a year or two At this point Im begging them to give me a hysterectomy Im only they wont Ive passed out twice already due to low iron because of blood loss Had a blood transfusion once because the blood loss Please explore your other options first
230,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42177,6,Ive been on the shot for about seven months now and havent experienced any of negative side effects that Id heard horror stories about no weight gain no unusual acne no unusual hair growth no significant appetite changes etc I did have pretty irregular spotting and bleeding for the first three months but now I cant remember the last time I saw any blood which suits me just fine Overall the drug has treated me pretty well I like not having to deal with my period each month the only downside for me is having to schedule regular Drs appointments to get the injection
231,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42176,12,This was the worst birth control method Ive been on I had a period that lasted weeks Thankfully my doctor prescribed me back to the pill and now the bleeding has stopped I also experienced serious mood changes I was constantly tired and upset I would wake up in the middle of the night drenched In sweat with a very fast heart beat
232,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42176,11,I had my daughter in February this year I received the shot the day I was released from the hospital The shot didnt hurt and didnt quell the after pregnancy bleeding I believe that was inevitable This shot hasnt made me gain weight at all Im lbs when I was lbs when I was at my last check up before I had my child The real problem with this is that I am a fricken mess I cry at the drop of a hat I have ZERO appetite and have to force myself to eat BUT I have longer thicker hair and my body hair didnt change Im blonde and itd be easy to tell The serious down side is that Ive been on the shot for months and HAVE NOT STOPPED BLEEDING Good lord Its been months of ruined panties and tampons
235,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42173,8,This was a huge mistake for me Do not take it I wish i read the reviews before i got it I only got one shot which last for months and only in three months igained pounds My life style didnt change I was working out pretty much every day and eating helthy still I got bigger than before Everything got worse when I discontinued the shot i got super sad and crying for no reason my energy is right now i just wanna be in bed all day i am sleepy during tye day The acne seems to increase a lot even in unusual areas like my scalp My period is super mess up i bleed for two months i dont wanna have sex I knew about the side effects before but I didnt know that it gets worse even stopping the shot this too much to handle
236,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42173,18,My experience on this shot was Awful to say the least I gained lbs and became extremely depressed and started having anxiety I only got the shot times and gained that much weight I am now struggling with body image due to this shot It had a huge effect on my joints as well I am now weak always sick have stomach issues and am always tired I never had any of these symptoms before starting it Not to mention it didnt help my period at all I was having if for weeks straight and a day between then Id start again I was perfectly healthy and it has ruined my life Never take this medicine
237,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42169,10,So Ive been on depo for two years now And Ill say it has been the worst Ive gained lbs I have constant headaches and backaches Im very moody I spot one month after getting the shot up until I get the next shot then it repeats I have bad cramps and lots of hot flashes Im getting off the shot next month because this just isnt the BC for me
239,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42167,5,This medicine made me have really bad mood swings I took it to stop bleeding Bleeding never stopped I even had thoughts of suicide Outburst of crying for no reason No thanks
241,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42165,40,Ive been on the depo for over two years now For the first months I experienced light bleedingspotting but the doctors told me to continue as it wont be long until my body got used to it After my third shot the bleeding just stopped completely It is best to carry on with it because I havent had a period in over a year just occasional spotting every couple of months if that Weight gain was a problem for me but Im not overweight and I can lose if I stick to a healthy diet Other than that Ive had no problem with the depo its really not as bad as people are making it out to be Once you get past the months of bleeding you dont have to worry about a thing
242,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42164,9,I was on Depo for about years My period would immediatly stop everytime I took the shot That is the only positive Aside from that I gained about pounds from the shot Thank God I was really small when I got on it and my fat is in the quot rightquot places However it doesnt change the fact that this is something that should not be on the market Doctors will tell you that it is your diet that is causing the weight gain However my diet is the same as it was years ago I decided to get off the shot as getting a period is a part of woman hood and not enough of a reason to keep injecting something that awful in my body I have been off about months now Thankfully my periods are regular now but I plan to see a dietician soon
244,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42161,21,I got on the shot on October th I thought it would end my periods but I ended up bleeding everyday for six months straight My third shot that I had got on April th ended the bleeding for about a month and a half and now Im bleeding again and this time Im having cramps as if Im on my period My next shot is on July th and I will not be going through with it The depo shot just ruins your body I hate it
245,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42160,20,I got on the depo not only for prevention of pregnancy but also everyone I know stopped getting their periods How awesome is that I was very skeptical about it because everyone I knew either gained an excessive amount of weight or just were not able to loose at all My experience was great for my first shot I got my period once throughout the months and I was still able to loose weight without any issues My problem started when I got my second shot About weeks after receiving the shot I got my period which was fine but that was April th and it is now June th and I still have Its not a heavy flow at all mostly just spotting and clotting Will not be receiving rd shot I want sex If the bleeding wasnt so much Id continue
246,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42159,17,I got my first shot April th My period was supposed to come May th and didnt It was a week late and Ive been bleeding and spotting ever since I have bad mood swings and get mad over absolutely nothing I get cramps all day every day and its it so horrible Its been almost straight weeks of bleeding sometimes heavily and other times just spotting I dont know if it even protects against pregnancy because you cant have sex if youre constantly bleeding I would NOT recommend this to anyone ever I have an appointment with my obgyn on Tuesday so I hope there is some kind of solution since I have to ride this out til the end of next month
247,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42159,7,I was on the depo for n a half years got off in Feburary started my period march Its now June and still bleeding I hate this bc
248,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42158,5,By the time I got my third shot all hell broke Ive been bleeding nonstop was given Orsythia to stop the bleeding and that didnt work After having a blissful time on the shot now my body is rejecting it I guess I wont be taking a fourth shot
250,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41973,33,I got this shot a few weeks ago and my side effects are already horrible I had anxiety before but now its so much worse My mood swings are unreal and my breasts have been so tender to the point where I cant touch them at all and theyve grown a ton Not to mention the few pounds Ive already put on in the short time I will never take the shot again I dont recommend this form at all Once you get the shot not matter how miserable the effects are you cant do anything about it Going back onto the pill once this wears off
251,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,41973,55,Hi Ive been on the shot since the beginning of May Ive been bleeding constantly for months with very frequent headaches I almost thought I was anemic at one point due to the shot However it was very effective in preventing pregnancy but definitely not worth all the other symptoms
252,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41965,28,I LOVE DepoProvera Only shot every months Unlike the stupid pill which I keep forgetting to take Weight gain is the only negative thing for me which I dont really care for No mood swings no period So Im super happy with my shot yay
253,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41960,40,I first tried the shot a few years ago I only got one shot For the very first time it lasted three months so did my period so I stopped I now have a son and I went back to the Depo shot and my body has seemed to work with it now I talked with my doctor and she said that very common and to just go through with the nd and rd shot Now I have no period and I dont have to remember to take a pill please give it another try
254,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41960,24,Two years on depo I have been combatting depression fatigue and vaginal dryness since my third shot hoping that I could overcome them or being in denial that is was from the shot but its definitely a side effect of the birth control Though the shot is convenient with no periods and strong hair and nails I totally feel like Ive been through menopause and am an old lady with NO sex drive Switching to the patch in December wish me luck
255,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,41957,35,Ive been on the shot since January and today is my st time bleeding Ive been on and off of it for over years and have never had bleeding while on After getting off at times Ive had constant abnormal bleeding until period regulated again
256,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41957,15,Im going to be soon I had really heavy periods for days straight and my period would come a week early It was regular just less than a month until each one and I also had really bad cramps to the point where I couldnt move The pill was my first option and it made me bleed for months straight A while later I was considering birth control and I finally chose the DepoProvera it was the perfect choice for me Once I got the shot I never got a periodany bleeding again I personally didnt gain any weight All the side effects didnt bother me And works well against pregnancy Ive saw a lot of bad reviews but mine was perfect so everyones body is different I would recommend talking to your doctor Heshe will know whats best
257,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,41957,23,I have been on it now for yrs amp love it Before I would be in bed for weeks with bad cramps it was destroying my life I get little cramping well the shot is due but I can live with that
258,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41948,92,I thought the shot would be easy due to the fact of taking it every three months compared to the pill taking it everyday but the shot does not work for my body I have been bleeding for over a month now I am going back to the pill
260,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41940,40,Didnt get pregnant but how could I when I bled for months straight And gained weight
261,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41939,41,I have been using the Depo for years now I noticed during the first year I would spot lightly when I usually got my period and my cramps went away After the first year my period pretty much went away for the most part However when I do occasionally get spotting it lasts for about weeks and it comes at random times In the past year I can recall it happening three times For me it still beats getting reglar periods and it has taken away my horrible cramps so I deal with it The pill always made me sick no matter what brand I tried so that is another plus with the Depo But everyone is different and everyone will react differently
262,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41938,13,I have been on the shot for years I love it my doctor said I will have to take Xanax and Lexapro with the Depo to even out the mood swings I am fine and my moods are good it is natural that your body has bleeding and spotting I have it too but it does not bother me as much as I suffered with PMS forgetting things all the time and being bitchy Now I dont have that I FEEL GREAT Cramps yes but not as bad
263,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41930,18,I was on the DepoProvera for years It worked amazing for me Never got my period after the third shot and never got pregnant What I didnt love was that I got all the bad side effects that came along with it But dont think this is a bad birth control because I got every side effect that came with it I was just unlucky my body is different then other peoples My friend got no side effects on this birth control Just note that this is a short term birth control tho I think I was on it for too many years Im on something different now I would recommend this birth control
264,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41918,22,When I first got the shot I skipped my first period and then had really light periods after that for a few months Then my period started occurring more often About weeks of bleeding then week off then bleed for week then week off or less then bleed for weeks Really weird That occurred for a couple months Then I started bleeding non stop for awhile It was really light but who likes bleeding all the time Finally at about year of sticking it out I now am back to skipping the first period after getting the shot and sometimes skip the second or sometimes light spotting I do bleed a little heavier just before my next shot is due Makes me think its wearing of too soon Had no other side effects though
265,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41916,82,My shot ended in August and since then I have been constantly bleeding I went in and saw a doctor about this issue and they told me to take pain relievers times a day to stop the bleeding I have tried that and I am still bleeding I will never get on this shot again I have been on this shot before and never had issues like this
267,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41906,40,Im years old Im a sophomore in high school I started taking the DepoProvera shot around my freshman year It actually hasnt given me any bad side effects beside loss of hair I havent lost a lot a hair and mood swings My freshman year I weighed and now I weigh Im and havent gained a pound from this shot yet I hate shots but its definitely worth taking for having no period I havent experienced depression or any of the other side effects except the ones listed above But not everyone is the same I would recommend talking to your doctor about it before jumping into taking it
269,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,41902,53,This shot has caused me so many issues I got it only once Before the shot I had abnormally heavy periods that lasted days and to be honest Id rather go back to that My body has had so many issues The first month things were fine The only issues I had within the first month was headaches and nausea the nausea got EXTREMELY severe at times I actually had to grip onto my boyfriend just to get stable or lie on the floor Then came the second month EXCESSIVE SPOTTING I also got major depression and hated everyone I am currently on my third month of the shot and I am still spotting heavily and sometimes bleeding Due to the shot I am now anemic and facing heading to the ER but I cant because I do not have insurance
271,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41901,43,I liked this medication when I first got it but after awhile I started to get migraines dizziness hot flashes weight gain heavy bleeding and severe depression
272,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41896,88,I got DepoProvera on June at the hospital after giving birth to my daughter Today is September and I have not stopped bleeding at all I also have two friends who have the same problem This shot is terrible
273,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41889,1,Im writing this review to offer some hope when I first got the shot I read all these reviews and it freaked me out Luckily I had none of the mood swing or depression side effects but definitely still got the cramping and bleeding After my first shot I didnt bleed at all for about weeks until my regular cycle was due Started with spotting and then bled regularly for the next weeks I read some other reviews from people saying they stopped bleeding after the second shot and lo and behold one week after my second shot and I stopped bleeding completely I know I felt like I was going to bleed forever so hopefully thisll offer some hope to newcomers of the shot Especially when they say something like of women stop immediately
274,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41889,32,Ive been on Depo for year and months and first my periods would last weeks days instead of days After my rd shot I had no more periods but lately my last shots Ive been spotting due to getting my shots at the th week instead of week Ive had no complications inspite the lbs gain weight from the shot This September Im due for another but have decided with my fiance to put a hold on the shots Just remember ladies everyones body is different so what may work out for me wont on others if one birth control doesnt cut it for you try another the one that suits you best Good luck
275,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42158,26,I have been bleeding profusely clots steady bleeding for a year and a half yes months I have seen different OBGYNs I am and have fibroid tumors and ovarian cysts Both doctors have used the quottry this and seequot approach and I have been given Provera Depo Shots and Beyaz birth control None of these have stopped the bleeding After taking the Beyaz last December my blood sugar level rose to and it took a month to get it back to normal Of course now I am considered a diabetic and have to take Metformin every day despite the fact that I was not diabetic or prediabetic before then It is ridiculous that these doctors will not consider a permanent treatment option
277,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42154,17,I got the DEPO shot on December and I started bleeding on January it is now May and I have not stopped bleeding I now have Anemia due to the blood loss Do not get this shot It is terrible One thing is for sure you will not get pregnant because you will not have a sex life
278,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42154,14,I loved the idea of taking one shot and not having to deal with pills The birth control pills never worked for me they made me sick and did not prevent pregnancy Ive had shots so far the st one was great I had no period for the first month but then the second month I had heavy bleeding and what my doctor described to me as quotmy vaginal wall falling out of my bodyquot it was horrifying I will spear you the details but needles to say it scared the crap out of me I continued with my shots listening to my doctor she told me that my body just had to get used to the shot Im due for a shot next week and Ive decided to go wo the shot has caused me mood swings bleeding uncontrollably etc no more depo Its horrible
279,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42153,11,I started the depo provera on June this was going to be my first time on birth control and I thought this would be a easy way not having to worry about taking a pill daily and I heard eventually it will stop your period to begin with Boy was I ever wrong when I started the depo I got the shot while I was on my period so it ended like it was suppose to be the next month July my period came early and it did not stop till September It was the WORST choice Ive ever made My whole summer was ruined because my period was so heavy I went through depression which I never have before I did not get another shot Im glad I made the choice to stop now over a year later my body is back to normal thank god
281,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42151,13,I was on this medication for years and in this time I did not experience any side effects maybe a little weight gain but nothing drastic I went from giving birth to the needle straight away and never had a period spotting or anything For me it worked but I know some who it didnt work for so my suggestion is try it if its not for you then stop what do you have to lose
282,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42151,13,I started the shot around Feb and went in to the clinic not knowing what I wanted I decided on the shot there and then but then read more reviews after I got it that freaked me out depression loss of sexdrive anxiety etc Im pretty moody as it is so I was terrified of what I had put in my body I did bleed and spot for about weeks after which I think is totally normal because that has happened to me in starting any new birth control pill amp patch Then I started to realize that my body was taking really well to it I never noticed any major mood swings aside from the emotional being I already am know yourself Got the second shot amp still going good Im sure there are longterm effects though that could be considered
283,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42151,14,Ive been on depo since I was years old I am now years old I first got on depo because I had really bad cyst on my ovaries and breast With depo it has controlled the pain and size of cyst Ive gained maybe pounds since Ive been in this No bleeding no spotting what so ever I do get lower cramping once in awhile but it is tolerable I also do not plan on having kiddos so this was the best choice for me
284,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42150,8,Had to get an abortion just over a month ago Wanted to use a different birth control because I started getting very sick after years of taking the pill Depo seemed to be working fine for the first couple weeks Then all the sudden I notice I am angry at almost everything The next minute severely depressed Yelling at my significant other for no reason I already had mood swings before and now its horrifying Ive gained weight and feel awful about it I just got my first spotting last week Ill bleed a lot Then a little Just waiting for it to end Bad cramps everyday I knew I shouldnt have tried this method but the pill makes me sick to my stomach Not doing depo again have to figure out something else Again
285,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42149,17,Worsed birth control ever I got it jan its April today still bleeding two months now straight every day all day first it was brown and black color no cramp Then last week I had very bad cramps and passed a blood clot the size of a golf ball now I have bad cramps and bright red blood tired all the time hemoglobin at Im due for the second shot first week of may I will never do this to my body again Everyone in my house is suffering my husdan kids and myself
286,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,42149,5,Have had the shot three times now after switching from the pill to the depo due to cysts and this was supposed to help stop them Ive had no pregenancy scares but severe bleeding for four months now and black blood weight gain like crazy and breast pain everyday it works well for birth control but the side effects are not worth it
287,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42148,17,Worst decision ever Got depo shot after wks postpartum thinking it was the most convenient birth control method Oh so wrong Got it started bleeding a month after I am still bleeding Limited sex due to period bleeding its not pretty Terrible mood swings Increased cravings for sweets and junk food dizziness very tired and sleepy Well its a horror story I am not going back for a nd shot no way I will never get another shot of this medicine that transformed me in to a non stop bleeding witch
288,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42148,13,I was on Depo from the ages of with absolutely NO problems NO bleeding it stopped my periods completely NO side effects I went back on the depo August currently ages and have been getting the shots every months on the first date they are due I have been spottingbleeding almost the whole time When I have sex it seems to make me bleed more Everything has been ruled out and its just been blamed as a side effect of the Depo from my doctor I also managed to get pregnant and have a miscarriage while on the shoton time with each due date The longer I am on this the more side effects I am starting to get acne SEVERE depression anxiety and mood swings I recommend for younger only
289,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42147,15,I recently got the deposit shot March th for the very first time And for the rest of the month I didnt have an sign of a cycle Come April th Ive been spotting ever since I even went to the Dr at the end of April to get estrogen pills to stop the bleeding and it stops bit as soon as you stop taking the pills it starts right back spotting again which I stopped taking because it caused a yeast infection so then I had to get med for that Here it is the end of May and Im still bleeding And come June Im scheduled for the nd shot There is NO WAY Im ever getting this again Can someone tell me when does this ever stop I even started reading up on natural ways such as herbal stores to help stop the bleeding What helps
291,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42145,23,Why would u make such a awful drug plz discontinue this stuff I know how it stops you getting pregnant you bleed every freaking day so who would have sex with you no one I wanted to take the time out of my day to say this medicine sucks and I hate it Ive gotten only shots and Ive been bleeding for weeks I just wanted to let u know that Thanks for nothing
293,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42142,6,I was never into birth control so I have kids My oldest years old I tried depo shot after I gave birth in November to my th baby all natural vaginal births no epidural This was my first time it was the shot on the booty and arm I have had nothing but aniexty no its not my kids i never felt this way before and I gained ton of weight more than I usually do after a baby I weigh I usually get down months after I give birth Ive been bleeding nonstop I decided I didnt like the shot Im getting tons of mood swings more than the ones that I get from pregnancy Im just going to tie my tubes Its a nightmare Its May now so from November to May Ive been bleeding I went to check my hemoglobin its fine its just depressing
294,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42141,11,Im just finishing up my first month on the shot and I can honestly say that its working well This is my first birth control Ive had and there have only been a couple of side effects I spotted for about days twice within the first months which isnt bad But I also experienced some vaginal dryness that required additional foreplay as well as lube at times Overall I think its fine considering I dont have to remember it and the spotting I heard gets better over time Im due for my next shot in a couple of weeks after which Ill offer another review So this isnt a bad choice but with any birth control there are side effects
295,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42140,9,I was on the shot for yrs straight about yrs ago I absolutely loved it and I would have recommended it any of my girlfriends I didnt have one period and no cramping for yrs Loved it Not even weeks after missing my last shot I became pregnant My daughter was born in and about months ago I started the shot again Worst decision of my life I have not stopped spotting Every damn day for almost months and Im starting to get really crampy and Ive have terrible migraines Ive been having mood swings and Ive never experienced anxiety so bad in my life I would seriously consider looking into the side effects and reading up on the shot before you get it
297,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42138,11,Well I had my first months shot on th January and two days after it I started bleeding I have never stopped and the date today is th of may Quite depressing since it was my first time taking contraception I had all the possible side effect to be honest Hot flashes at night terrible migraines severe back ache fatigue tiredness name it There was a point i went to doctors everyday but now I got used to feeling ill which is quite sad So you are taking a risk using DepoProvera
298,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42137,37,I am yrs old Since the birth of my first child Ive had very heavy painful periods Often irregular as in a couple times a month But I have been bleeding for almost months now Three months ago I was put on Provera mg once a day It lightened my bleeding after a few days then I had brown discharge for a few days But I started bleeding again even while taking the Provera I first had a day supply then a day supply another weeks and now more But it has changed nothing Im bleeding and cramping nonstop and still have no answers No fibroids polyps or cysts
299,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42136,4,Had the shot two years ago and loved it no periods no sure effects I stopped it for a while and got another shot weeks ago Severe mood swings painful acne sore breasts period pain and migrains Spotting non stop for weeks Will never take the shot again
301,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42054,73,Ive been taking this shot since October Ive been bleeding non stop since December It went from a weeks period to a month period Ive taken Meds to help amp nothing This horrible Its like Im on the shot for no reason
302,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,42049,9,I was pretty terrified to try it out hearing amp seeing all these bad reviews I got my first shot in November around the time my period was ending So far that was my last period The first month I did get a little bit of cramping which I usually dont get I havent had any cramping since then amp also by the time I was due for my second period I spotted instead for maybe days my periods usually last days amp it seemed like it was more like discharge than it did spotting Again thats been it no more periods so far nor spotting As for gain weight I may have gained a few pounds honestly not sure I never step on a scale But nothing drastic I just recently got my second Depo on February th well see if all goes well
304,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42034,33,Have been on DepoProvera almost years since being diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis as it is the only contraceptive my consultant could recommend that doesnt allow ovulation I can honestly say I find no faults with this contraceptive I get it every weeks as apposed to every weeks to keep it built up and not allow bleeding I was on the pill version before and it didnt agree with me but the injection has worked wonders No pain nausea anemia or bleeding My life has changed because of this medication I would honestly seek professional advice if you found this didnt work for you as it may just be a case of dosage or time span
305,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42030,20,I have been on Depo for years Its effective No kids I started seeing side effects around year which included a little facial hair Around year I gained about pounds I went from to about its still so worth it No periods and no cramps after year I take calcium supplements and I lift heavy weights so along with getting bone density testso far so good
306,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42029,9,I was on DepoProvera for a few years with one break to try the Nuvaring just because of the bone density loss warnings I had no weight gain or bleeding or hormone swings just some occasional crazy night sweats Then I had my first baby in May and started Depo in June It has not been the same experience My bleeding is irregular and lasts days to weeks and this month has hit me every other week It is January and I quit It just isnt working for me this time around
312,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42011,11,Effective and not disappointed After the first weeks on the shot I had heavy period for almost days but after that absolutely no period no cramping spotting nothing Some weight gain but Im successfully burning that off The only downside is the depression and anxiety but those are occasional They only happen within the first couple weeks of taking the shot and I just got my third dose Love it but its not for everybody
313,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42010,67,Ive been on the shot for about a year and months and ama Still having my period irregularly and it will last about weeksb Am on my period now and have been on it so far for weeks
314,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42008,19,I got my first Depo shot November th Since then I only had minor spotting and cramps no mood swings or major weight gain if anything my weight is far more stable and satisfactory Although on the nd of January I began my normal period again and hoping it will end on the th Definitely would recommend
315,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42006,47,Everyone I talk to seems to have had different experiences with Depo For me it has been a perfect experience but my sister had a horrible time with it I had very light spotting after the first shot during what should have been my monthly period and since then have had absolutely no period or spotting My weight has remained at a constant level the entire years that Ive been taking it and I havent experience moods swings hair loss or any of the other common symptoms My doctor warned me that the shot could make my migraines worse but I havent noticed any difference in prevalence or severity Everyones body reacts differently but it is definitely worth trying I love this form of contraception no periods and no babies
316,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42000,96,I got one shot September its now almost January and I havent stopped bleeding in over a year
318,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41997,63,I have been receiving the Depo shot since July This has been my first and only birth control Ive taken and a huge benefit is that I am not worrying about taking a pill However for the past months I have experienced spotting It is not enough blood to need to wear a tampon however it is very dark blood which stains underwear This has been extremely frustrating to me and I am now trying to decide what will be my next best option of birth control will be
319,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41994,27,Im due for my second shot next week Im very torn about getting it When I got the shot I didnt have any side effects at first Every month since the shot I bleed for about weeks straight It really bothers me One of the main reasons I got on it was to try to help my periods Just makes them worse
321,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41991,37,Ive just gotten the second shot today and I must say I love it havent had my period had the tiniest bit of spotting I still get cramps when Im due for my period but nothing else I have also not gotten pregnant at all Probably the best decision I ever made
324,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41978,17,Ive been on the shot for years no cycle no other children and no weight gain The only side effects that I think Im having now is low sex drive because I cant get into sex like I used too I dont like taking pills and forget to with vitamins so I know they wouldnt be a good idea But I do think being on the shot for so long actually messed with the hormones because my face tends to break out every other week but other than that I love it but its time to get off
325,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41483,20,I got the DepoProvera when I got the intrauterine device taken out Ive only had the Depo for three weeks but Ive been bleeding everyday and because of being injected with hormones my mood has been awful Ive practically broke up with me boyfriend so now it seems Ive got the Depo for no reason
326,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41472,16,I had the best experience with the DepoProvera I first went on it Jan I have had absolutely no periods since then I did gain some weight about pounds but have been able to lose it with proper diet and exercise I should point out I frequently eat fast food and frozen pizzas so that Im willing to bet thats the reason I gained weight and the Depo had very little to do with it The shots werent that bad and having to only get it every three months was very nice I was on DepoProvera for about years and loved every minute of it but every doctor I went to said that DepoProvera isnt supposed to be long term and that I need to consider a different form of Birth Control I will try Nexplanon and if I dont like it Im going back on DepoProvera
329,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,41455,50,I got on the shot in April for many reasons I worked at the YMCA in the pool amp I didnt want to worry about bleeding My cramps were torture I wouldnt be able to get out of bed During the first month or so I did spot and have some cramps but they eventually stopped I love the shot I did gain some weight but that was some what my fault because I stayed unactive But with a good diet and some exercise you wont gain weight Recommend it to everyone
330,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41455,13,Been on this birth control for yrs now and have had no problems No period just very light spotting month before next shot due
332,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41450,13,Im years old and have been using DepoProvera for a year and a half and I love it I hope I never go back to the pill I did gain about pounds the first year but Im not sure I can blame that completely on the shot I was able to the extra weight within weeks of dietexercise I rarely have a period and even then its light and barely noticeable Never heavy bleeding like a normal period and that is awesome I get my shot in the arm and it never hurts or leaves my arm sore I also take calcium and vitamin C supplements to prevent bone density loss
333,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41447,17,Ive been on the DepoProvrea shot for about months now and I was absolutely terrified of gaining weight on it because of the multiples stories Ive heard But I actually lost weight so I love it I havent noticed any change in mood Perhaps a slight increase in acne but hardly anything to complain about I did have spotting for about weeks in the beginning Overall I really like it I dont have to take a pill every day and there arent really any noticeable side effects
334,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41446,11,Love this medication I suffered with painful periods and ovulation and terrible mood swings which all got worse after having my kids I tried various birth control pills but without a great improvement especially with mood I just had my third shot I only gained lbs since the first shot and I no longer have a period Ive had some slight acne but happy to manage that overall for me its been great Very happy I should add that I am taking calcium and Vitamin D also
336,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41432,10,I started on the Depo shot right before I entered college and it has been the best experience ever mainly because I dont have any more periods For the first months I had lighter and shorter periods without the awful cramps And now after being on it for almost years I havent had a period in a year and a half I only went on birth control because I was scared of getting pregnant in college but I would truly recommend this to anyone who is fed up dealing with period cramps and other inconveniences Also for any other college students most universities will only charge for the shot and injection but since I already had the prescription from my doctor and my insurance they only charged me for the lab injection
337,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41424,101,Im years old I never been on any other birth control but the months on DepoProveraI bled for months as well as depression I was PMSing the full months Caused problems in my relationship because of it
338,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41423,8,Ive been on the Depo shot for a year now and the only problems Id faced were the headaches nausea and mood swings Its Great not having a cycle Im opting to try another method but the shot seems most effective Although everyones Experience is different mine was Okay
339,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41418,11,Ive been on Depo for two years st year was rocky with the spotting and mood swings nd year was great Still not pregnant no more side effects I take my vitamin C and D Ive gained lbs no difference Ive tried the pill and patch and hated them equally for different reason I would hate to have to switch birth control I love shots and no babies Its great for me Good luck with your experience
340,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41409,10,Depo was fantastic at doing what it was intended to do control birth However I was on this for years and gained at least pounds I was also bipolar and cried over everything On the plus side I only had my period times a year right around the time of my next injection
341,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41408,7,Im with two kids and I always had regular periods I was on the pill for many years and decided to try the Depo shot I had some spotting but my period completely stopped after the nd shot It was very nice not having a period and taking a pill every day I didnt start gaining weight until the nd shot and I felt hungry all the time Ive always been a small person and maintained my weight without diet even having kids I had Depo shots total and went back on the pill because my weight kept going up I gained lbs and havent been able to get rid of it since
342,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41406,13,Ive been on the Depo shot before and other than slight maybe lb weight gain and slight mood changes I had no problems with it I was off of it for about months and just got back on it and in one week have gained lbs and get skin rashes pretty consistently now My mood is ridiculous I cry like every day sometimes out of happiness other times out of sadness
343,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41405,10,Im and was on the shot for months Before I was on the pill but didnt like the side affects and remembering to take it everyday The first month on the shot was great Then slowly things went downhill and got bad I was getting acne on my back which I never got before and was really insecure about and my periods were getting longer I decided to get the second shot because I knew my body had to get used to the hormones Then I got very intense cramps that would wake me up in the night and make me feel sick My period would last weeks Before I had a very light and short period and light cramps These new changes are too much for me so didnt get the third shot Going to try the patch
344,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41404,10,I have been on the Depo shot for years I have always loved this type of birth control First year period was unpredictable But ever since wonderful not having one About ten years ago I read in a magazine about the Depo causing problems with bones while sitting in doctors office to get my shot I asked the nurse about it and she advised me to get a bone density test which I did The doctor called me when he got the results and asked why I would take such a test and was not happy that I did So I keep it with my records and kind of forgot about it Went in this month to get my shot and the doctor informed me that this would be the last shot he gives me that he is going to refuse any future shot Not Happy Loved Shot
347,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41388,21,I am and Since I first received the shot in January I have been bleeding ever since Sometimes light sometimes like an actual period with cramps and migrainesAlso this medicine has completely jacked up my hormones I am angry ALL the time ALWAYS sad I cry everyday over the smallest issues or for no reason I am happy and in a split second I will feel very low or even have suicidal thoughts I experience extreme mood swings and flip out on my boyfriend coupled with less sex from the bleeding Its very frustrating I am hoping that this is just my body still adjusting to the medicine I havent had any weight gain or acne though knock on wood
348,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41382,53,I love the Depo shot No side effects at all I read so many negative reviews before I took my first shot I have experienced none of the side effects I read about in the reviews I have not had any break through bleeding as many people described I have had no periods after the first shot Before Depo I had painful cramps before and during my period No pain and no weight gain I am so pleased with this form of birth control
349,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,41368,56,I started my Depo shot around September a week or two before I was about to get my next shot I started my period I thought when I received my next shot it might stop it It didnt I am still on my period and it is April I have my next shot today and this is my last attempt if it continues I will be switching back to the pill Not only that but I had major weight gain and depression
350,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42120,5,Ive been on the shot for a while Started it after a miscarriage with DampC procedure I havent had a period no weight gain like people are scared of and no bad side effects Im pleased The pills and patch caused nothing but problems
351,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42119,4,I was given a depo provera shot after an essure procedure I had never taken it before I had non stop bleeding for months until my doctor gave me another birth control to take on top of it The bleeding stopped for a couple weeks but came back and has not stopped for a month and a half Definite weight gain This drug should only be used to treat specific conditions and not be used as a general birth control
352,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42119,19,I was on the depo a little over a year ago had no problems nor period the whole time This year I returned back to the depo feb and have been bleeding for months straight The Depo is terrible NEVER AGAIN
353,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42119,16,I only had shots then stopped but about months after stopping I started having constant bleeding and its been nonstop for almost months and for me its way more of a hassle than its worth
354,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42118,20,Ive been on this shot for a little more than a year and at first it was fine but about halfway through my year I began having random periods of spotting I noticed it usually began after and sometimes DURING sex I havent gained much weight or anything but bleeding during sex is NOT fun I would recommend this form of birth control but something must be done about the irregular bleeding
356,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42113,12,DepoProvera is the best birth control I have ever experienced I have had NONE of the said side effects No weight gain no bleeding whatsoever and no uncomfortable side effects It is easy to remember only having to go in every months I highly recommend this form of birth control Great experience
357,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,42110,61,Hello everyone I just wanted to give a recent review in provera Before I started provera tablets my issue was I didnt have a period for months and I didnt understand why My doctor tested my hormones and everything came back normal I was so frustrated and confused because I didnt understand why my period had stopped My boyfriend and I are trying for our third child so not having a period was a big problem Finally my doctor prescribed me provera pill for days After days post taking the pill my period finally come yayyyyy I was so nervous because reading the reviews had me feeling like the provera wasnt going to work So I would recommend this medicine for anybody that have irregular periods or if your periods stop
359,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,42108,10,Ive been on the DepoProvera shot for over months now I received my first shortly after I had my son I was breastfeeding so this was my only option The only pros for me are its convenient Im a nurse and I just pick it up from pharmacy and inject myself or a friend from work does it for me then Im good for three months no remembering to take a pill Cons have been constant bleeding on and off longest being over weeks straight I have gained back all the weight that I did lose from having my baby and am now stuck at the same weight I was at months pregnant its awful and embarrassing I am constantly hungry like constantly and I crave sweets and chocolate more than anything I also am sweating like crazy all the time
361,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,42106,15,Ive been on depo for almost a year now Its had its ups and down Ups would be not having periods no babies and unprotected sex Downs would be the redbrown spotting weight gain and back pain what Im experiencing at the moment The weight thing is a little weird I usually weigh around and I gained about pounds and recently lost them from going to the gym and eating less fast foods Overall its the best BC method Keep in mind all that I described doesnt happen to all women we all vary
362,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42103,15,This shot has saved my life I was very hormonal with terrible painful PMS This shot helped with all of my symptomsincluding my constant back pain I dont really think the weight gain is a big issue because I know I gained pounds around my period anyways I have energy to do more important things now and it has helped my depression significantly It may not be for everyone but it definitely is helping me tremendously
363,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42103,6,Ive been on it for months now The only bad thing is depending on your body type youll gain a lot of weight I gained poundsyet it definitely filled in my small bodyI dont have a period any more but I always look and feel pregnant But it very effective as a birth control I highly recommend it and its easy to keep up with
364,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,42103,9,I was diagnosed with stage endometriosis at years old After being on Lupron for months my doctor proceeded to put me on Depo for the rest of my life until I decide to have kids and then back on the shot afterwards I am now on my th shot and Ive had horrible endometriosis painnot cramps very different pain and have had my period for weeks I am not sure the Depo is working correctly with my body but other than that the previous shots have made almost all pain from my endometriosis go away
365,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,42102,7,I got my first dose Feb th I cramped for about weeks I started to spot around March Ive been bleeding heavy on and off Since March to present Its horrible I have serious mood swings My face has broken out badly And Im always tired and constantly eating My body feels weak maybe due to lose of to much blood I wont be getting my second dose in May
366,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42101,11,I was on depo for and a half years it worked wonders for me I had awful periods before the shot After the first shot I had a light period for about weeks but no period or spotting ever after that I did not gain weight I actually lost weight It does make you hungry ALL the time for the first few months but I was wise about my snack choices with I believe helped alot This was the only form of BC me and my boyfriend used for the entire time and no babies It does take some getting used to not having a period to confirm you arent pregnant at first When we decided to have a baby it took months to get pregnant I didnt have any serious issues and loved it
369,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,42099,8,I started my first injection over a month ago for my severe endometriosis The day after I started noticing terrible mood swings as did my family I would get angry and freak out at the tiniest things Usually cry over nothing It lasted for about weeks and my moods have simmered down but not as much as they should He said to consider Zoloft because my hormone levels arent normal and I have anxiety I have been spotting everyday for the whole month and still notice some pain but not as bad as it was before I started the injections My obg said this was normal and assured me after the third injection this would go away Hopefully it does I can now say Im not living in hell times a year
371,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42096,25,I got this shot in January after having my son ever since then I havent stopped bleeding Im certainly thinking of taking the pill better I guess my body isnt working with this shot But it is very effective
372,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42094,12,Ive been on Depo for almost years now Bled spotted nonstop for the first months and a little after that The side effects normalized after a full months Initially I gained weight by only on the first few months When its close to being time for my next injection I get PMS symptoms and every now and then I get quotunusualquot unusual for me side effects with an injection but it usually is only for months and goes back to normal with the next one I do however experience spotting bleeding after sex sometimes Ive heard it can be from cervical capillaries that are made more sensitive from the drug but I dont know that theres firm research on it
373,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42092,9,I have been on the depo shot since I had my daughter which was years ago For the first few months I had spotting but that stopped I still get PMSlike symptoms around the time I would usually get my period I have gained pounds while on depo I have been getting bad migranes amp terrible aches in my body and Im not sure if its because of the shot I would definitely recommend this shot There is nothing to remember every day just show up to the doctor once every months
376,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42208,4,I had a great experience on this medicine I recently stopped because I got sick of the spotting What makes me mad is as soon as I stopped my body had finally got used to it I was a pretty fit person too I am and I weight about when starting and then dropped down to Its very very rare to lose weight so dont think it will happen to you but I went to the gym in my spare time I mainly ran a lot and I lost the weight It was great and I never had to worry about being pregnant I plan to go back on this bc again Plus it was free I have tried plenty of bc and cant stand the pills tried the nuvaring because that was free with my insurance too Nope hated it Everyone is different but overall this was the best BC I was on
378,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42204,6,Hello everyone I was years old when I started the depo I finally got off the depo at then turned around and got the year IUD at the age Now Im years old turning in July I never been pregnant never had no abortion Now I want a child and cant even get pregnant I just dont know what to do If you know any fertility pills let me know please
379,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometrial Hyperplasia Prophylaxis,9,42203,4,I am yo I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and always have been very irregular with my periods to the point of going for to months with not even a drop of blood recently my doctor found abnormal cells in my uterus lining he prescribed medroxiprogesterone for months pill daily Am done with the treatment now and during the months I got my period times only but in overall I felt fine no major side effects I only felt it a little dizziness and a few headaches I also put on some weight but with exercise I have managed I feel great and cant wait to see the results of my next biopsy
382,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,3,42201,13,I took Provera pills daily to stop my periods to kill the monthly pain I chose pills over the shot so I could have control of deciding whenif I wanted to stop I took the pills for months The first month I had lots of breakthrough bleeding basically I was slowly bleeding for a few weeks After that I had no period no spotting no cramps that part was FANTASTIC However for me the side effects were severe and unlivable I had insomnia waking in the night every night I had night sweats every night I gained a little weight I had extreme vaginal drynesspainful intercourse which was a first ever for me My sex drive was nonexistent and my acne and facial hair PCOS got much worse
383,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,42201,26,Ive been taking Depo for about years and its never given me any negative symptoms I went on it very young because I had painful abnormal periods I havent had any menstral cycles the whole time which means no pain Ive never struggled with weight gain My bones are healthy and strong in fact Ive never had a broken bone in my entire life Its highly effective as a birth control and I am very happy with it
384,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42199,6,I find the depo really good as im still on it Ive been on it since November and havnt had my period since no weight gain besides maybe pounds not bad at all seeing im only lbs and havnt had any other side effects I find its very effective and happy i dont have to worry about ruining more underwear
385,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42199,4,I first had this shot in I had two but felt sick all the time my periods did stop though Came off it and went back on the pill didnt have a period for a year and a half In I decided to give it another go soon settled down and didnt have any periods at all stayed on it for years It was fabulous no periods or spotting But I was suffering from depression which is a side effect of depo I decided to come off it Started my first period after about days and it lasted about a month and it stank Had about a weeks break and then bleeding again thick dark brown clots In the end I gave up and went back on it after injections still having random spotting lasting random amounts of time Just hope it settles down again
389,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42194,11,I love the depo shot Ive been on it for over two years now I have had no period or spotting until about two years on it I only spot about weeks before my next shot and have had a little bleeding lately Other than that I really love it And no weight gain
390,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42193,4,I got this shot bc of a pregnancy scare and its only been a week but Ive had non stop brown spotting I read about the pill and it said no extreme things But now Im reading reviews and Im totally freaked out and now I cant get out of it The whole point was so I could have sex with no worries but now I dont have sex bc it would be nasty So dont do what I did pay attention to negative reviews
391,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42193,32,This shot has temporarily ruined my life I am close to my month mark of this shot which means another dose I am strongly considering not getting another I am currently typing this at am because I woke up after bleeding through my pad Not fun Ive been bleedingspotting for over half of the months I am always bloated tired and emotional Sex drive gone not to mention the constant inserting and deserting of tampons dozens of times a day The only thing i ever see is blood Im constantly tired i dont have the drive to do anything This shot has consumed my life
392,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,42192,10,The amount of characters I can type is limited but my story is long so Ill shorten it for you Ive almost had the injection for a full year I have also almost had my period for a full year August will be the anniversary and also when I give up on this birth control Not spotting a full on period Upon receiving my last shot the technician severed a nerve Ive never had a good experience with the administration of this injection If I do not strictly work out based on how much I eat every single day I begin to gain immediately I also have extreme very extreme body odor vaginal oral the worst is under my arms It also completely ruined my libido From start to finish the experience has been nothing but awful
393,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42192,5,I started this shot in order to stop my already heavy flow and it did the complete opposite Every time that I take the shot I am period free for a week and then after that months of constant bleeding It was the worst idea ever Thank goodness that I did not go with the arm implant I bet that I would have been bleeding for years straight no breaks
394,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42192,11,I was on the depo for about a year everything was perfect Then I had stopped taking birth control went back on the patch then I had to go back on the shot Now Im due for my third shot and Ive been bleeding for two weeks Every time I think its done I become active with my partner and it all starts coming out again He and I have been together for a year and a half so the only good thing about it right now is that Im not pregnant
402,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41794,70,Ive been on DepoProvera for years this month It was great Had little to no periods light spotting for a week before I had gotten my next shot Didnt have to worry about taking pills daily I had no side effects at all I was actually losing weight But the last shot I had back in March they informed me that there was a new type of Depo formula that took place of the Depo that my body was used to Ever since then my period has been not stopped I gained pounds in one week of water weight My cramps has been terrible to where I cant eat I feel as though Im pregnant at all times I go Tuesday to either get checked to see if I need to be off it Anyone else experienced this since theyve changed it
403,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41793,21,Ive been on Depo for months now its almost time to get my third shot After my very first shot I had no bleeding at all for two months just random cramps that were kind of annoying Then at the third month I spotted very lightly for a week then bled normal for about a week then bled really really heavy for a few days Then it stopped and I got my second shot Two and a half months with no bleeding after the second one then spotted lightly for over a week and no heavy bleeding It seems to get better so I cant wait for the bleeding to stop completely Also the only other side effect I have noticed is increased nervousnessanxiety I have had a few anxiety attacks at night and I thought I was having a heart attack but it was nothing
405,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,8,41789,98,Didnt have a period for years was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and hypothyroidism As hubby and I have been trying to conceive not having any periods has been difficult to judge any ovulation Was put on Provera to induce a period before doctor prescribes any ovulation mediciness Took Provera for days didnt have any side effects But after I stopped I felt nauseous breasts were very sensitive was over emotionalvery irritable and a bit dizzy at times Had light spotting on day and after stopping Provera then period starting on day Day and were lightmedium but then afterwards was extremely heavy for days with really bad cramping
406,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41788,4,I had this Depo for two years and as much as it was easier with no pill no period etc it ended up the worst thing Ive ever had I have developed cystic acne hard nodular lumps under my skin which have left me depressed with how they look They were awful and my hair was shedding rapidly I went to the doctor and came off it he put me on Dianette and advised to take it the first day I come on months in and no proper period One weekend I suffered severe and I must emphasize severe pain and cramping I could not move and was having very dark blood clots To this day my skin is still awful I am now on lymecyline and the doctors told me to use the Dianette contraceptive for my skin anyway I have never ever had skin problems previous to this
408,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41770,13,So I started this because Im terrible with rememebering to take the pill daily I absolutely LOVED the fact that I only had to go in every months to get it done The shot was very minor with little to no pain For the first three months it was heavenly I had no side effects and no period what so ever But the road after that was hell I gained a total of pounds in months due to the fact that I was hungry all the time I was very moody and depressed also Not only that but I basically lost all my sex drive and the majority of the time on the shot I spotted and when I wasnt spotting I was on my period
410,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41768,15,I am years old and have been on DepoProvera for around years I have very little side effects amp absolutely love not worrying about pregnancy or periods I cant imagine going back to having a monthly period I am very content with my light spotting every three months a week before my next shot I never plan on having children so I have no problem staying on this longterm Ive been losinggaining pounds on and off many years before I started Depo and considering I do not exercise I cannot blame any weight gain on this My only concern is bone density loss I eat calcium rich vegetables daily amp take vitamin D but may start calcium supplementation as well depending on my results from a bone density screening
411,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41766,71,I was bleeding for weeks lightly and then all of a sudden it came and I was passing large clots and a lot of blood My doctor put me on Provera mg twice a day I had a horrible headache and felt tired but my period did stop which is great
412,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41759,19,I have been on Depo since last August shots I love it I had two pill pregnancies so obviously I had to get on something that I didnt have to worry about remembering In the first months I did have some bleeding issues I would spot for weeks at a time but I havent had a period in a long time I havent experienced any of the other side effects either I love it and I recommend it all the time
413,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41754,21,Ive been on the shot for about two years now and Ive only spotted a few times here and there I did gain almost pounds though I do like not having to worry about a regular period though and I used to have slightly heavy periods to I would say its been more positive then negative
414,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41749,13,Im years old and I have been on the shot since July I havent had any of the side effects like having unusual cramps headaches or ance The only problem that I have is I spot on and off for about weeks right before Im supposed to get my next shot
415,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41746,1,Just recently have got Depo subQ provera for the first timeat the same time my best friend has gotten the regular DepoProvera shotI havent had any side effects no mood swings no weight gaining nothing While shes had some mood swings going on I dont know if its because its a different Depo or just because Im a different person but Id recommend this to people Plus its a much smaller needle that goes in your stomach instead of your arm
416,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41741,42,My experience with Provera has been a very painful situation I am and was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome at the age of I never had regular periods since the age of I was always on some form of birth control to regulate I was taking the DepoPovera shot depo shot for about months before I decided to get off due to the excessive weight gain The Nurse Practitioner weaned me off of the shot and decided to give me the Micronor birth control pills which did not help as well I have been on my cycle for months I can ot afford insurancethe only thing I could do was to go to the emergency room I seen the ER dr there where she gave me the Provera mg four times a day My bleeding has gotten heavier
417,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41735,21,Ive been on the Depo for about months so shots Ive never had bleeding until this past week a full week straight Never had a period until now Never even had any period pain or anything close to it I love the low maintenance associated with the shot but if this continues I may have to stop
419,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41729,19,Had it for a year and a bit Gained weight Stopped it months ago and get my period twice a month Painful ones too
420,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,6,41726,14,It does what its supposed to at least for me it did Im prescribed to take days of mg Provera every night before bed every days or every two months I dont have a cycle It makes me feel awful though The first month I was prescribed Provera I took all pills Im on the smaller side and I really think mg is just too much for my body I have horrific constipation amp gas after about days on it absolutely zero energy and my face tends to breakout only small its always clear otherwise it also makes me starving It works though
422,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,41722,40,Ive only had one shot so far but it has now been almost two months since I got the shot I heard good things about this shot and I was hoping it would take care of my really severe cramps I skipped my period the month after I got the shot but then the month after that it came back I would say my period is a lot lighter now but it has lasted twice as long as it normally does My cramps have been better as they are now tolerable But they are still there I have noticed a really big change in mood swings and emotions I get in cranky moods WAY more often At least once a day I also have noticed that I cry super easily now even over little things Again though it has only been two months Maybe things will start to get better
424,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41718,10,Ive never had acne and I cannot seem to get rid of it Im sure its because of the Depo Provera as it started shortly after my first injection I am in my s and an active runner My hips and knees seem to be much more sore after runs after I started the Depo I also have osteoporosis in my family and that is not helping my bone density situation On the positive side its easy to take stops my periods and I lost weight on it All that being said this will be my last cycle as the convenience is not worth brittle bones or a face full of acne
425,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41588,14,Ive been on the Depo for about months now and am happy to say I will not be getting another shot I received my first shot days after giving birth I have not had a period besides the constant bleeding for weeks after delivering but do get get brown discharge instead which doesnt bother me The only thing I HATED was the weight gain I gained about lbs after every shot And its been VERY hard to get rid of I also have no sex drive But besides that I havent expierenced any other side effects
426,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41586,24,I started the depo shot in January due to my extremely heavy periods It had gotten to the point where I was missing school a few days every month and just laying in bed because my menstrual cycle was so bad I decided to try out the depo shot Ive been on it a year and have just recently had spotting in between my shots Depo shot has helped so much I no longer have periods except for the occasional spotting and I feel SO much better Granted I do get the occasional migraine spotting and cramps Id say the shot is definitely worth it
430,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41583,11,Ive been on the Depo shot for about months I decided along with my doctor to get the Shot because i have what is called bacterial vaginosis cysts on my ovaries and also constant yeast infections It has seemed to help with all of the above reasons of why I initially started the shot On the shot i have experienced horrific migraines nausea extreme mood swing severe depression and high levels of anxiety I also spot monthly and for the first two months i bled heavily I am actually going back to the doctor to switch to either a different birth control or to completely get off of BC I hope this helps yall
432,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41579,4,I started the birth control shot in the day before my th birthday To say the least it was a terrible decision The shot was great in some ways I did not have a period the entire time I was on the shot months and through my st month on the pill after My periods were always irregular though It was also nice to be free from worry about contraceptionThe bad overwhelmed the good though The first week that I was on the shot I had bad headaches Not migraines but they were painful I spotted lightly halfway through the st month and continued for weeks At weeks I became horrifyingly depressed I wouldnt have survived if I hadnt known that it would likely be better once I stopped the shot
433,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41578,8,I have been on depo for over a year now My positives would be no period easy and thats about it However I will no longer be receiving this birth control Did you know that this same drug is used as a quotchemical castrationquot for male sex offenders They give it to them to drastically decrease their sex drive Makes you wonder what it does to women For me it has done just that I started receiving the shot right before my husband and I got married and I didnt even want to have sex on our honeymoon It has seriously affected our relationship and that is why I do not want to continue the shot
435,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41567,7,I have been on the depo shot since I was years now I love the shot I have never had an issue after my first couple weeks on it I never got a period again unless I missed a shot and had to wait for a period to get it again I swear by it one of the greatest thing you dont forget to take it daily no cramps no period nothing up your private area Until this past year issues I have been having all added up and led to this shot Im years old and have osteoporosis that of an year old the smaller of my breast became sizes larger my migraines increased to weekly with vision loss itchy sore breasts random stomach pains and nausea Also I have not changed my eating habits or daily routine I have out on lbs in the past mon
436,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41562,18,Ive been on DepoProvera for about weeks now As for my period its been amazing I havent gotten my period once and Ive gotten spotting once and it last around seconds Unfortunetly about once a week I get excruciating migraines to the point where I cant see Also I am having such bad hair loss Im starting to get worried Im also finding some foods I love are making me nauseous and Ive became slightly claustrophobic The worst of all though are my constant mood swings I am constantly mad over nothing at my boyfriend Almost every other day I seem to get really mad out of no where Its like Im not myself Depression isnt really an issue but it comes with my mood swings I also have no sex drive whatsoever
437,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41562,9,I have been on DepoProvera for about weeks Started spotting a pink color Then my period came a week late Ive been bleeding over a week as of now Next shot isnt until next month Cramps used to be severe but now I barely feel them Appetite has changed Mood swings all the time and constantly feel nauseous
438,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41560,82,I have been on Depo now for over years I should be paid to be their poster child It was the miracle medicine for me and my body After horrific years of monthly hell I started Depo Immediately the periods went away my hormones balanced and I literally regained my life I have had no long term effects no weight gain no side effects at all For the right person this works amazingly well For others it does not But it IS worth a try
439,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,41559,11,I have taken Provera once before to help regulate my period My menstrual cycle is very irregular I can go up to months between cycles with some cycles lasting up to months and it seemed to have worked after the first time taking it However after six months or so my periods became irregular once again Ive just started taking it for the second time and it seems to be working although I will have to say its given me some pretty intense mood swings
440,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41555,26,My first shot of DepoProvera was almost three months ago and I am due for my second shot in less than two weeks I will not get that second shot and must say DepoProvera worked very bad for me Ive been bleeding straight for two months now awful mood swings and depression extensive hair loss and no sex drive at all
441,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41540,26,DepoProvera has changed my life I am now period and yeast infection free Which is a HUGE deal for someone who has suffered from yeast infections x a month for the past years as well as heavy painful periods Havent had a period since my first shot which was weeks ago I am a healthy year old aside from suffering from migraines I have not had any side effects from DepoProvera no acne hair loss weight gain etc
443,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41536,11,Ive been on Depo for about a year My periods used to be very heavy but now they are very light The downside is that they last about weeks Ive gained about pounds and experience some pretty crazy mood swings My libido has completely crashed and I almost always need to use lube I got DepoProvera because it fits my lifestyle theres no way I could take a pill at the same time everyday
445,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41518,17,DepoProvera worked very well In fact I really loved it I only gained about pounds I do work out times a week Had my period times a year and it was so easy just one shot every three months The only downside was I got a bunch of acne and a bit of hair loss Each month around my period I still had the cravings but never got my period Now that I am off my acne cleared up a bit I highly recommend this birth control Very effective
447,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41514,13,Ive tried different birth control pills before trying the DepoProvera Theres no estrogen so I dont get moody or sensitive I also didnt gain any weight at all and was able to go back down to my normal body weight that I was prior to taking the pill version of birth control The only side effect I feel is a little bit of soreness in my hip after the injection but thats to be expected The one complaint I have is that youre only able to stay on it for years Id stay on it until I wanted to be pregnant if they would let me
448,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41512,35,I was taking Provera for days after my fifth day my period came on a week later and has been on for a week I wanted to know how long would it last Before I had this my cycle stayed on for months none stop
449,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41489,16,Ive only had my first shot The first month was okay I was always hungry severe backaches amp headaches and few hot flashes I got my cycle a week or so late Im in my nd month and Ive been having really bad cramps constant bleeding and diarrhea No weight gain at least not yet
450,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42136,11,I decided to get the shot a month ago So far I have not had a period at allwhich is almost scary but who wants their period anyway No weight gain as of yet and no hair loss I almost backed out of getting the shot once I heard a few horror stories The only thing I have noticed is a little moodiness which happens to me on the pill too so nothing new Not sure about getting the second shot yetwe will see how the next couple months go and if any other symptoms take place but so far it has been great
452,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42132,3,I was on the depo shot when I was and had shots and BOY DID I BLEED the best part was the fact that I never had any cramps but I bled for over years straight and didnt have a regular cycle intill reaching the rd year
454,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,42132,12,I have been on this shot for just about one yearI have had one period since being on it which lasted almost a month not heavy by any means still very annoyingNot noticed any weight gain but I always go up and down give or take poundsI would recommend it everyone is different and has different side effects so it is unknown how one persons body will take to itBut worth testing it outHated the Pill
455,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42131,18,Honestly everyones bodies work differently and Ive heard horror stories about every type of birth control but this one has been really excellent for me Ive been on the depo shot for years now planning on switching soon The shot does sting a bit so be sure its injected into your hip instead of arm First month I spotted nonstop but I havent had a single period since No pregnancy scares Very gradual weight gain for me lbs over the past five years Cleared up my acne have plenty of libido I give it
456,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42131,4,I have actually just had my th shot and its been great for me Bled on cerazette like crazy so switched to depo injection My only complaint is that in the nd shot I got really bad boob pain and a bit of weight gain Never had a scare good birth control and also its every months so no problem
457,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42129,7,This is the best birth control I have been on so far I used to be on the pill and it made my periods irregular made me gain a crazy amount of weight made my acne worsen made me super emotional all the time and many other bad side effects I was off birth control for a couple of months and was back to my normal self and actually lost about pounds My doctor thought I should take birth control again and recommended that I switch to this so I took a chance I had one period after I got my first shot about months ago and havent had one since The only bad side effect that I have had with this shot is I gained a little bit of my weight back
458,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,42129,13,I have always had amenorrhea irregular periods my whole life Recently at I discovered that I have PCOS Polycystic ovarian syndrome by testing that was done I am starting to take Metformin to help it I have to have Provera prescribed every months for prevention of endometrial cancer I have depression and PMDD which is a severe form of PMS so the only downside is that it makes me extremely depressed for when I do have my period But it always makes me have my period by the third fourth or recently fifth day It does what it is supposed to do though and that is good
459,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,42129,18,I have always had amenorrhea irregular periods my whole life Recently at I discovered that I have PCOS Polycystic ovarian syndrome by testing that was done I am starting to take Metformin to help it I have to have Provera prescribed every months for prevention of endometrial cancer I have depression and PMDD which is a severe form of PMS so the only downside is that it makes me extremely depressed for when I do have my period But it always makes me have my period by the third fourth or recently fifth day It does what it is supposed to do though and that is good
461,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42128,12,I am and have been on Depo since I was due to severe menstrual bleeding When I first got the shot I noticed my bleeding kept lightening up until my second shot and it stopped all together I eat like a pig but thats not really a big deal for me During the first months I lost pounds and slightly over a year later Ive gained back I know a lot of girls fidget and carry on over the weight issue but if you exercise daily and eat appropriately it wont turn into a big deal I definitely recommend this to my friends who either have bleeding issues or just dont want to get pregnant Works PERFECTLY in both cases at least for me
462,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42128,23,This is HORRIBLE I have had the WORST anxiety than ever before and I havent stopped bleeding for weeksI only got this shot weeks ago thinking it would be good Would not recommend this to anyone
463,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42128,7,I had my second shot about a month agoI havent had constant bleeding every now and then maybe times since January I have had spotting I have experienced some cramps but not as bad as I usually get and I have definitely gained weight I had sex for the first time since I started the injection and I have been getting cramps and bleeding like I used to before the injection This has been going on for a week now I am worried and Im not sure if this is normal after having sex on the injection Apart from whats happening at the moment I personally do recommend this injection I started it to stop the pain and just have a break from bleeding and it has done exactly what I wanted it to
464,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42127,8,So yes its effective BUT NEVER GET THIS SHOT I had it times months worst nine months of my life Constant spotting and bleeding never was able to go on the boat because I didnt have enough bleeding for a tampon but would bleed threw a bathing suit felt very uncomfortable and always had to think about if I was bleeding never wore white bottoms or pants It was THE WORST experience of my life If you see this DONT TAKE THE SHOT
465,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42127,29,I have been bleeding for months straight nonstop I am not a happy camper I only got this shot to stop my cycles for a bit but I got totally the opposite I will not get another shot ever
466,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42127,10,I have been on the depo shot for about two months about weeks ago I started having a lot of pressure around my tail bone area horrible cramps way more emotional and spotting then BAM Mother nature hits with a vengeance non stop period yes the depo is awesome because not getting prego but not having sex is having the same affect
467,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42126,11,Ive been having constant bleeding or just huge blood clots since I got the shot weeks ago Also its caused me the worst anxiety and depression Ive ever experienced in my life I would not recommend this to anyone ever
468,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,42126,7,I have been on the depo shot since October After my first shot I bled for months straight I consulted with my doctor and she said it was normal I got my second shot and I bled weeks straight Within the shots I started noticing acne headaches all the time and lots of anxietyfatiguedizziness and I find myself being hungry all the time I told myself that I would not get a rd shot I have severe cramps and I have not bled since the weeks after I got my nd shot so I was happy about not having a period I decided to go ahead and get the rd shot I have not had any bleeding but the acne and headaches anxiousness dizziness and fatigue are all still happening I dont like what the shot is doing to my body therefore I
470,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42125,35,The reason this shot is such an effective form a birth control is because it keeps you from sex THATS RIGHT The bleeding is so on and off that its kept me completely abstinent At first I thought this shot was the bomb but seriously I keep telling myself my body will adjust but I feel like Im constantly on my period Its messed up
471,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42125,4,I started the depo a little over years ago but took my last shot in August Since then I have had normal periods but some times have heavy periods in between my periods so Im almost bleeding a month and a half I have had horrible mood swings amp horrible cramps It was great while I was on it I even lost lbs while on it But this sucks
472,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,42124,1,The depo shot is extremely effective however I had the horrible experience of mood changes I became an absolute terror and began becoming depressed after just one shot I am switching back over to the pill
474,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42122,4,I really like the shot I have had no weight gain or any other side effects I did bleed very lightly for two weeks my periods normally last or days after the first month on it but I havent had any periods since then Occasionally I will get brown discharge or very light spotting but it is such a small amount that I dont even notice I cant take most birth control because I cant have estrogen but I am very happy with the shot
477,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41694,19,Ive been on the Depo shot for Months I had shots so Faru the first shot was great Ive had no periods at all when I got my second shot About weeks after I started bleeding almost everyday but once I got my third shot it had stopped I am not having any problems so far But I Am constantly losing weight like when I started the shot I was lbs I am now lbs how is this happening I eat all the time
479,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41688,19,I have been on Depo for about a year now I got it in April in and now its February I kept bleeding since I got it till about October So I had about shots by then When got my rd shot I stopped bleeding I havent got a period since then I weighed about lbs now I weigh lbs I gained so much weight
480,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41687,8,I started using DepoProvera middle of January it has been a month and I havent had a period I have severe breast ache on my left breast and sometimes I may get cramps I sleep all the time and I am always tired and on edge I have control on the way I feel and I am grateful for the injection as I forget to take my pills
483,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,41679,26,My first birth control experience was a disaster I was taking TriSprintec TriSprintec made me gain pounds acne increased my periods and did the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do After one year of searching the internet for an alternative option I came across the DepoProvera shot I have been on it now for months so this is my third shot and I have come across no weight gainno periods and I think I am one of the few women who has been so lucky The only thing is for the first month of EACH shot you have bloating some pain a little headaches etc It goes away for me after that Nothing I cant handle compared to the periods I was getting before Everyone is different though but I highly recommend this
484,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41679,14,It was great at first No periods and no hassle of taking a pill However I was so tired all the time that I would sleep hours and want to go right back to sleep It also made me very depressed and moody almost manic at times Not to mention it made my breasts smaller
485,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,41678,39,My doctor put my on DepoProvera after laproscopy for endometriosis I had irregular periods after the first shot and after the second I remember I had one period that seemed to last for a month This is a known side effect and as promised it went away after the third shot I havent had my period now in about a year I also havent had any debilitating endometriosis symptoms either I think I gained about lbs total but then again Im also in my s and that could simply be a part of aging I am a big fan It gave me nearly total relief after getting through the first months
486,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41668,24,Ive been on the DepoProvera jab for years due to heavy periods Ive not had one since I spot occasionally but that is very rarely Its not for everyone warranted but it changed my life It has its ups and downs but Im a strong person and I manage the mood swings and Im sensible enough to know now that nearer the time of my jab I get cravings for food and after Ive had it they go My skin improved and I lost weight Thats because I knew it can cause cravings so I managed it I would recommend it if you are a strong willed sensible person Its not a lighthearted contraceptive
488,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41667,15,I am wks into shot and feel horrible My sex drive is gone side pains cramps headaches and so tired all the time My mood swings make me feel like I am crazy Oh and now I have this metallic taste in my mouth I just want to sleep all day because of the constant crampingI feel horrible My face is changing too I am black and my face looks so dry and discolored
489,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,41661,27,Had the depo shot for about weeks now I too experiened bleeding for quite a while until my rd shot very light but it look like a normal side effect Now I am completely fine not gained any weight no migraines no pms Sometimes bleeding a week before Im due for my next shot but I was assured that is common
490,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41651,38,I have severe endometriosis and a lot of scar tissue from laparoscopic surgery four years ago when they removed two large cysts that were wrapped around my fallopian tube which I lost Then last year my right ovary hemorrhaged and I bled internally for two days two weeks ago I had a cyst rupture on my ride side I am SO done with being in pain Ive been in non stop monthly HELL for the past years So I got back on the DepoProvera shot I took it when I was a teenager for two years for my endo pain And I loved it I am so glad to be back on it I am also on a seizure medicine that makes birth control ineffective but has no effect on the Depo shot so that is another plus
492,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41642,17,I have been on DEPROVERA shot for about a year and a half It works of course But I have recently decided to quit with the shots because of the horrible side effects I have headaches every single day I just want to sleep and thats all I want to do Im a very active person so that was easy to notice Also I get horrible shooting pains that is in my lower stomach and back
493,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,41621,25,I was really worried about taking this medication I was on birth control and was very moody and emotional and gained about pounds so I went off it and didnt get my period for over months I was told to take this pill for days and I would get my period to days later I took it and sure enough days later I got it Very few side effects just that I was tired My period is kind of heavy but it has been months so I have to make up for lost time I practically had no cramps and feel so much better than I thought I would Definitely would highly recommend it I had a very positive experience
494,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41618,31,I have just recently got my second shot a few weeks ago and since I received my first shot I havent had any periods or abnormal bleeding or spotting I dont even get any side effects It has helped so much since I used to get severe painful cramps and lay in bed for the week when I had my periods It makes me have a lot less things to worry about like chance of pregnancy periods cramps and a lot more things my body was emotionally drained from
495,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41607,34,I have been on the Depo shot for about years now I love it No periods or spotting Cramps sometimes but nothing outrageous I think its a very good birth control
496,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41594,10,Im years old I was on the pill at first but I got off because I was ALWAYS moody So I got on Depo so far its been okay but since Ive been on it my face has started peeling Im always putting lotion on my face
497,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41593,12,I have been on Depo Provera since I was so about five years I have had no issues with it I have not had a period in years before I had terribly heavy periods I did not experience any weight gain do not have trouble staying fit and do not experience any moodpersonality swings I just dont like that its likely weakening my bones but I try to stay on top of that with calciumD supplements However I do wonder if its had a negative effect on my sex drive but thats inconsistent and I have nothing to compare it to since I got my shot as soon as I became sexually active so its hard to say
498,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41591,13,Comment As mentioned in my previous comment I personally have had no issued with the Depo shot and would have loved to continue on this form of BC The reason I am stopping is because my older sister tried the shot about years ago while I was away at school I never knew this about her experience and our doctor says this side affect has never happened before but it was like the others where she experienced CONSTANT HEAVY bleeding for months straight but it wasnt like a period blood she was bleeding internally It made her blood cell count change so drastically they thought she had cancer She was hospitalized for about a month I will not be continuing the Depo Shot because she has begged me not too
499,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41590,18,I have been on the depo shot for almost months now and it hasnt been too bad The only problems Ive had is severe mood swings nausea and headaches daily Im a sick person anyways so Im not sure if Ive gotten other side effects but I do know those are from the depo My periods are now pretty much gone My second shot I had a period for about months but it wasnt heavy I plan on getting off of it though after this shot wears off because I have been reading a lot of bad things about the shot Severe mood swings depression anxiety hair loss osteoporosis infertility etc I eventually want to get pregnant but you can lose all options if you continue the shot for an extended period of time and I dont want that to happen
500,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41889,23,Very effective but bad side effects Im and Ive had two doses of it but I wont be continuing it I have gained weight that is IMPOSSIBLE to lose I get head rushes and I feel dizzy almost every time I stand up and lots of cramping I stopped getting my period but one every monthtwo months I have a few drops of blood but thats it Im not happy with the shot but it was effective
504,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,41865,31,Ive been on the shot since April now that I have my second shot I spotted blood a few times but now theres constant bleeding
505,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41865,11,Im yrs old I went on DepoProvera for months and it was horrible I constantly felt like I was running a fever and sweating like crazy I had horrible PMS but no period The only good thing about it was the convenience
506,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41864,34,I started this birth control at lbs so I was already a little heavy but I was working out and eating healthy to keep losing weight The first shot seemed fine By the second shot I gained lbs which I thought was odd but the doctor said it was normal I then started becoming very depressed and spent most of my days sleeping or in bed I gained another lbs when it was time for the third shot The rd shot made me gain more lbs where I was at I always ate relatively healthy and went to the gym And I decided to not take the th shot And its been about a month past when I was supposed to take the th shot and Im finally starting to lose weight Im at now and still have a long way to go
507,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,41862,57,I only had one shot It lasts months During those months I got my period the first month amp not the other two Now I came down to Trinidad on vacation before I was able to get my second shot Now Ive been bleeding for months STRAIGHT I know this is abnormal I have the worst cramps amp my whole body hurts
508,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,41862,38,I have been on the DepoProvera shot for years I love it I havent had a period since I got the first shot Then one day randomly I started spotting I wasnt to concerned at first but the bleeding went on and got heavier over a span of months I had been trying to get into the doctors but that hadnt been working out Finally I was able to talk to my doctor and it just turned out to be my body basically adapting to the progestin so instead of coming in every weeks I come in every to weeks depending on if I start bleeding
509,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,41861,18,Ive had DEPO PROVERA for about two years for the first couple of months I was bleeding like crazy then it lightened up to only spotting occasionally and bleeding the week my next shot was due I gained pounds throughout the two years which was not bad but recently Ive been bleeding for almost a week straight it kind of sucks because I have a boyfriend and I want to have sex I just have to deal with maybe the next time Ill get the shot it wont be as bad If the bleeding continues as it does now I might just go back on the pill
510,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41860,15,My first shot of depo was great no mood swings or any other side affects other than some very light spotting Happy with my first shot I got a nd but it didnt turn out as the first shot did Im happy because theres no mood swings or really any mental side effects which is why I switched from the pill However I was told my period would completely go away or just be light spotting but for some reason I have now been having a normalheavy period for over a month now which concerning Ive also been experiencing a lot of headaches and cramps that can get so bad theyll sometimes wake me up from dead sleep Ill be going to the doctor soon to get off of this blood loss is not fun c dont think this is super common though
514,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41844,20,I gained pounds on Depo Provera shot
515,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41841,24,When I was I had the WORST period Major cramps to where I couldnt go to school bloated super bad So my dr Recommended the shot I got it And since then Ive had not even the slightest spotting And its been years One night the condom broke completely and I was so worried But didnt get pregant Ive gained pounds over the course But I for sure recommend
516,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,41841,6,I was on the Depo shot for a little over a year and a half At first I had a very long period days for a few months when my period was generally about days previously Then I stopped having a period altogether Its been a month since I was due for my shot After reading online I was worried that I would be waiting monthsyear to get my period back after it however I woke up today and thankfully got it Ive never been so happy to get my period before I guess Im one of those lucky few that get their period back as soon as they are off of it
517,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41835,17,My first shot was July the last shot was March Four shots total and in that time I had some type of vaginal discharge every month I wore some type of pantyliner or pad everyday during this time because I never knew if I would have a period The bleeding wasnt always heavy but I bled enough that I became iron deficient anemic I did experience larger than normal clots some months I wanted to try the full year to see if my periods would ever stop but the lack of iron made me get off Depo
518,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,41831,13,After years of not getting the shot I decided it was time again endometriosis is very painful and it had returned so it was time The last Depo Provera shot was great no periods no weight gain no hormonal imbalances This time I have the hormones of a pregnant woman and Ive been bleeding heavily for two weeks since giving myself the shot I dont have cramping too bad and my face has cleared but this hormonal imbalance headaches and heavy bleeding is kicking my butt even more tired than normal
519,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41824,36,I do not like this medicine Ive only had one shot so far I didnt come on my period for two months now on the third month Ive been on for weeks already The pain is worse then my normal cramps Im not getting my second shot Im only
521,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41822,6,I am with kids I tried the pill but had incredibly tender breasts tried the copper coil for weeks but had cramps and spotting I thought Id give Depo Provera injection just one go I dont think my body likes hormonal contraception I am constantly bleeding after the injection AND I suddenly have psoriasis all over my face and hands Its peeling red and itchy I look like someone beat me up Its embarrassing as you can imagine
522,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41821,11,I was on the shot for years Im pounds naturally I weighed up to while on the shot It is extremely effective for protection against pregnancy Although I have no sex drive and terrible mood swings and weight gain in abdomen face and buttocks The pros would be clear skin and effectiveness against pregnancy but wouldnt recommend it for short term birth control or for women who gain weight easily Took my body almost a year to regulate itself after stopping
524,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41819,7,Does its job as a birth control Convenient that it is only every months and its discreet However the side effects arent worth it I had mood swings increased appetite and cravings which lead to a lb weight gain within first months and constant bleeding for over months Once I switched to the pill after my first shot my appetite went back to normal Im acting like myself and the bleeding stopped immediatelyI receive free service at Planned Parenthood as a teenager so all of my birth controls are at no cost
526,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,42089,16,I have been on this shot for years almost now I had had no serious problems I gained about pounds and I am having trouble losing it but that is it When I first got on this I actually lost weight amp was the smallest Id ever been but I decided to try to switch to the pill hated it amp then got back on Depo which is when the weight gain happened I had major mood swings but am now on another medication to help control that It definitely works and love not having a period Just hate the weight gain This is definitely a birth control I would recommend
527,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,42088,0,for a long time i have been irregular bleeding i would bleed for months on end but sometimes it wouldnt be bad just light but others it would be to were i couldnt stand up so i finally had enough of that and went to the obgyn she presribed me provera and i am just now on my third pill on my second i started lightly spotting but it went away then today thrid pill i am bleeding not bad but enough to wear a pad hopefully this works im not to sure right now
530,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,42084,34,I hadnt had a period in months My doctor prescribed me Provera mg once a day for days She stated if I get my period in those days to stop taking the pill at that time Today was day and my period came I had no side effects from this medication I had normal cramps at the onset of my period this morning It seems to be a normal beginning flow as with any other time I had my period I will report back to let everyone know how long it lasted
531,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,42083,0,I would never reccomend this shot to anyone I know everyone is different but i am years old and have been on it for years Ive experienced crazy weight gain hair loss and my anxiety was bad before but now it is terrible where it is causing me to not even sleep at night anymore I do like the no periods but all the other side effects just kind of ruin that If you are looking for birth control methods all i have to say is just DONT pick the depo shot
533,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,42079,67,I have been on the shot since December th have had a period from January th to the present
535,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42078,29,Had abnormal bleeding after getting double dose that was a month before next dose
536,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,42077,0,I got the depo shot months after having my daughter in I wanted to make sure I didnt get pregnant again No periods at all and no side effects other than always wanting chicken I only got the shot that one time though because I moved and didnt have the insurance coverage anymore to get the shot I recently decided to get the shot again when I got a new boyfriend It was horrible I had constant headaches and more pregnancy symptoms than I had when I was actually pregnant I also bled for weeks at a time I decided I would give it another try after talking to my doctor and reading online that most people have issues the first one my issues are still the same with the bleeding I hate it
538,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42075,0,Was having some trouble with the pill i was on for a year and switched to the shot The first three months were great No weight gainacne and I felt great After about two and a half months I began to start bleeding and having severe cramps so much so I could not stand up straight At the height of my cramps I discovered my body had shed my entire uterine lining at one time and it was the most frightening and gross thing I had seen After the three months had finished I had my period for seven weeks and am finally back on my regular schedule Never again will I use this shot
541,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,42070,1,I took the shot after weeks postpartum due to breastfeeding aswell Slowly but surely I started experiencing minor side effects which graduly became worse after the rd shotOMGi gained pounds in months severe insomia heart palpitationshair loss severe anxiety arm pain shooting from my shoulder to my fingers numbness and tingling on both arms fatigue depressed When I really started getting concerned was when I started twitching and would goult out of my sleep with anxiety attacksI had chest pains n poking sensations in my heartI had no clue it was really from the shot till I decided to skip my next appointment and With in days of not getting the next dose I started feeling so much betterthe shot is POISON
543,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,42069,1,I am years old and have been on DepoProvera for almost two years while in a four year committed relationship My doctor recommended DepoProvera for me because I suffer from chronic migraines so any birth control with a high level of estrogen would most definitely make my migraines worse So far I have to say I am pleased with my experience while on the depo shot The side effects I have experienced have thankfully been able to be fixedaltered Such as slight weight gain which I help to control with diet and exercise Loss of sex drive which my longtime boyfriend is more than happy to help with And I tend to start spotting around the time that my next shot is due Once I receive the depo shot within hours the spotting stops
544,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,42064,29,I love how all of you say that you cant lose weight on Depo I gained about pounds started dieting and exercising and now I have lost all of that weight and more Yes I have some spotting but its better than having to take a pill everyday
546,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42063,40,I am years old and bled heavily for weeks Due to my religious beliefs I will not accept blood under any and all circumstances so I tried provera at an attempt to stop the bleeding On the st pill I went from bleeding heavily to just brown spotting and after days my bleeding completely stopped I was on mg for days I just completed my last pill today and feel better than ever Just happy that Im not bleeding anymore and I can be a mom to my month old daughter
547,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,42062,14,It is effective However the weight gain of lbs now I need to lose lbs The headaches dizziness and tiredness Feeling hungry constantly and occasional numbness in my hands and feet I am thinking of trying Implanon but the reviews dont look so great Would prefer getting my tubes tied as we have a nice size family I have been on it months since my youngest was born and I hate that I eat and feel pregnant even though I am not
548,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,42061,75,I got the Depo shot in October It is now February and I have been either spotting or full on bleeding since then I cant have sex because I start to bleed as if my period just started Ive been on and off the Depo for years and this is the first time Ive had a bad experience with it I also gained pounds since October but I eat healthy and go to the gym regularly
549,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,42057,6,New years eve I went and got my first birth control shot Ive been on the pill but Im inconsistent and it didnt do much for me No side effects except for oneNo periodThis is a possible side effect but the website says only of users and only after a year of use I was hoping for it but had resigned myself to waiting until Both this month and last month I could feel quotphantom crampsquot mine are in my back but no blood No pain Just a very tiny ache like what it used to feel like before I started Im very happy with it because it used to be bad enough to keep me in bed all day I just hope it lasts
550,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41367,10,Ive been on the shot for months now When I first got the shot about three weeks in I started to bleed like normal period but then got lighter and lighter and continued for weeks Eventually it went into light spotting about every weeks for a few days I also will get a lot of sharp pain cramps that will last a few minutes every now and then but this happens randomly Other than that I have no side effects The doctor tells me the spotting and cramps will stop as my body gets used to the shot
551,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41367,19,It was very effective amp I didnt experience ANY weight gain I lost weight My periods were shortlight amp it was nice not having to remember to take the pill everyday I DID experience more PMS also known as random crying tiredness dizziness and light bleeding between periods I heard your body starts to adjust to these symptoms after a while though but I got too nervous about not getting my period every month so I switched back to the pill If youre on the fence remember every person is different so why not give it try Its only for months at a time You can always switch back to normal birth control if you have any issues
552,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41358,20,I always had trouble finding the right birth control for years now Not only would certain ones contribute to a lot of weight gain or very bad mood swings I was horrible with taking my birth control pill on time I was having horrible cramping and pain with my periods to the point that I would have to call off from work Since being on the Depo shot I have had no side effects I always eat a lot and I dont work out often so if I do gain weight thats my own personal issue Im glad to read these reviews and to be informed about the bone density because my doctor clearly never told me that I havent had any mood swings or emotional breakdowns like the other pills did to me
554,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,41355,14,Ive been on the Depo shot for and a half years I love it because Im not getting any periods and its not like the pill having to remember it daily However in the course of being on this shot I have gained pounds Im always hungry and I get very moody I also have extremely bad headaches Im switching to the Nuvaring because my weight gain is unbearable and my headaches are chronic
555,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41338,1,I was on Depo for over years Greatest years of my life No period No cramps No bloating No PMS No side effects NOTHING My doctor made me take a one year break from itas straight years is way longer than you should be on itbut my bone density is fineand I will be returning to my Depo next month This past year off of the Depo was the worst year of my life My period returned approx months after my last shot and got worse and worse with each one Horrible acne Weight gain Moodiness Depo took all of that away For those of you who had constant bleedingspotting after your first shotit is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you get your first shot on the th or th day of your period to make sure amenorrhea kicks in
557,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41332,14,Ive been on The Depo for about months now I got on it to stop my period but Ive had non stop bleeding the whole time I asked my doctor if there was anything she could do and she said to wait it out I searched about bleeding on the shot and tons of people said they bleed continuously the whole time they were on and some said once they stopped the shot the bleeding didnt stop I also am breaking out in places I normally dont like in my neck line and forehead Im not getting the shot again if the bleeding doesnt stop
558,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41331,4,Im and got the shot about months ago So far my periods have remained regular On the downside I now feel hungry ALL the time All I do is eat I have these irresistible cravings now Im noticing weight gain of course because Im stuffing my face but Im miserable if I dont eat what Im craving or when Im hungry Also Ive been having excruciating headaches I already have migraines I had them for years before I got on the shot but they had stopped when I started a new medicine now theyre back since Im on the shot Its terrible hopefully the cravings appetite headaches and also these mood swings Ive been having get better If not Im switching
560,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41303,19,I was on birth control pills Ortho Tricyclen Lo for about years My DR told me I have high blood pressure She thought it would be a good idea to get off the birth control pills to see if that was the main cause of the high blood pressure amp recommended that I go on Depo instead She told me I could get the shot right there and then and then I would have to come back in months and get another shot I have only been on Depo for months The first month I never got my period The second month Ive had my period for weeks I cant have sex because Im bleeding Im crabbiermoodier then usual I can fall asleep just fine but I wake up at am every morning and cant fall back to sleep Never had this happen before
561,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41296,26,I have been on Depo for years now and the first entire year I had spotting almost everyday After that I would only get my period about a week after I would get a new shot which last at least a full week but are very light I love this birth control because I dont have to remember to take a pill every day I didnt experience weight gain I actually lost weight after taking the shot but I did experience some acne which I am not sure is because of the Depo or just minor adult acne I definitely recommend this method for birth control
562,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41293,25,Been on Depo Provera shot for months Dont know if its still early not to experience any side effects Im still happy on it and looking forward for my next shot The only thing Ive noticed is weight loss which I dont have a problem with but so far so good
563,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,41284,62,I got on this as a teenager for my endometriosis Besides spotting for the first four months I have had no ill effects No weight gain In fact its hard to keep weight on I got off of it to have my kids Now Im back on it Its so much easier raising toddlers without cramps and random bleeding I recommend it highly Dont let bad experiences scare you I actually had a horrible time with the pill I love my Depo shots
564,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41279,23,I hate to be another bad contributor but I basically started out fine No period for the first month Then I was bleeding for the next two months The worst part gave me the most ridiculous acne of my life I have never broken out on my jaw line amp cheeks before this shot so that was very strange amp painful I have been off of Depo amp switched to Trinessa amp am on my th pack I STILL am trying to get my skin normal and regulate the hormone change And Im waiting for the dark spots from my acne from months ago to disappear Its nice to not remember a pill but because I had such bad side effects I didnt even try to get my second shot
565,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,41277,18,On Depo for approximately yrs go No problems or sideeffects No period for yrsHEAVEN Got off of it Doctor said since I had no bleeding last time would be okay to do again Got shot a month agothe week I was supposed to start First week was great No bleeding but have had continual spotting every day since wks Hopefully it will stop soon
569,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41252,10,I was on the shot for a year I spotted for months at a time which didnt seem like a good trade off for no period I also experience mood swings that I couldnt seem to control My acne got out of control and I had break outs in areas that I didnt normally have issues with Then to top it all off I gained about lbs while on this shot To me the pro convenience of getting one shot every three months didnt out way the cons
572,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41222,13,Hello Ive been on the Depo shot and Im fully satisfied I didnt have any side affects Lost my period which is normal amp gained pounds All I had to do is follow my doctors orders wait to hrs so it takes effect amp Im fully protected I really recommended it Its worth it if you dont want to have a huge responsibility of having a child Or in some cases having horrible cramps amp heavy periods Im fan of Depo shot Everybody is different it works for me but maybe not for you Ill never be off it unless Im married amp wanting children
574,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41217,12,Depo is GREAT I recommend it to everyone that I know I have been on Depo for about years now and frankly I dont fault Depo for the quotside effectsquot I have experienced Yes I have gained some weight But I also eat a lot of carbs and dont exercise nearly as much as I used to So you cant blame Depo for that Also my doctor made it quite clear to me that Depo could affect my bone density so I take a chewable calcium supplement every day and so far my bones are in great shape And lets talk about the number one life changer no period I used to have awful cramps and heavy bleeding but now I literally have no period whatsoever Occasional spotting but thats really rare and only lasts for a day do yourself a favor and try Depo
575,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41214,17,Started Depo years ago Spotted the first three months and felt horrible Then all side effects went away Got off of it to have my child and now Im back on it No bone issues No weight gain No complaints
577,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,41196,46,I have a really hard time taking estrogen birth control and I decided to get the Depo shot After reading the reviews I was so scared I canceled my appointment to get it After thinking about it I decided to just go ahead with it and see what happens Ive been on it a little more than weeks and Ive noticed that I am a little more tired and I have some pimples that are starting to go away Other than that I havent had any spotting tender breasts sexdrive changes etc Usually before my period I eat nonstop and have cravings and its nice to not have that I will write again to update how its going in a few weeks I wanted to let people know not to be terrified It may work for you and if it doesnt just dont get another shot
578,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,41193,29,I got my first shot in June and at first had my normal day period but in July I started bleeding again and been bleeding since I got my second shot in August and that didnt help Im still bleeding and having migraines that I never had before and its October
579,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41192,2,I am and was on it for half a year and never had a period I got off it in January and still today have no period and its been months
581,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41168,11,I was less than pleased to find out that I could use only the Depo shot for birth control I was on it before about yrs ago and I gained weight my hair fell out etc etc So this time around right after the first shot I bled spotted literally for months straight Every day Also I was very very moody irritable and my sex drive tanked Really bad I decided to take the second shot at the last minute and I cant be happier that I hung in there I have not bled once since my moods have stabilized and my sex drive is back Also I was worried that I would gain weight but believe it or not I have lost a few lbs
583,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41151,6,I have had my period for two months so far This has caused me to be extremely anemic which has made my hair fall out and Im so weak
584,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,41150,4,I have been on Depo Provera for years now It seems like a lot but Im and have been on it since I turned so there is not much bone loss Im off it now but I loved it I didnt gain weight no cramping no nausea no migraines I WAS depressed but the Depo actually fixed it I bleed light for about a week right before my shot is due but its once every months I love it but years is pushing it for osteoporosis so I just switched to the pill today
586,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41135,3,I took my first Depo shot in February of this year and for the first month I didnt have any side effects so I thought it was great but then came the abnormal bleeding I literally had spotting from March to June It was so miserable even after it wore off it was still happening Finally just this month yesterday my period came back normally Also I had really bad acne the whole time it was in my system when normally I dont have acne at all and I dont just mean a couple of pimplesit was like deep acne which left me with scars on my face Other than those two side effects Depo is pretty awesome as I didnt get pregnant and didnt have to remember to take a pill Im now on Ortho TriCyclen and seeing how that works out
587,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41134,10,My experience on Depo has been a nightmareI have been on it for almost a year I will be bleeding for a month straight then it will stop for a week or two if Im lucky then its right back to bleedingI have also had awful headaches bad body aches severe abdominal cramping mood swings random depression and chest pains
588,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,41126,2,Im years old and I have only been on the shot for months and some change now I like the shot I had regular periods before but they were really heavy and painful I tried the pills once and took all of them A couple of times I forgot to take them on time but took two the next day but the shot works better for me The only negative thing I have to say is it does mess with my moods like Ill get sad out of no where and start tripping and the weight gain I dont mind because Im already a size I want to gain some weight During the first month I spotted the whole time Not a regular period just brown spotting But its gone away now and like I said Ive only been on it for months and some change now so overall for me I like
589,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41120,0,I tried the shot twice once on August and recently started again in May First time was bad I had really bad anxiety and moodiness which at first I thought it was hormones from having the baby I couldnt lose weight even though I was exercising everyday After the months the first time no more moodiness like before when I was on it I had also lose weight and things were back to normal I wanted to try again because I only did it once but again it has been a bad experience
590,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,41115,36,It has been almost months since my shot and I have been on my period the whole time I gained pounds and I was the most depressed Ive ever been I went insane with mood swings my already bad pain got worse and I had head splitting migraines among other things I dont recommend it to anyone It should come with a prescription for Xanax and some weight loss pills to try to stay on top of things
591,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,41112,39,Been on this shot since June Started experiencing abdominal pain on July and spotting on July SEVERE abdominal cramps as of July that continues I turned up anemic when I had not been just month before As of today I am still experiencing abdominal cramps periodically continue to spot or have what seems like a full fledged period alternately without any pattern My Gyno placed me on the shot to stop my heavy bleeding due to Uterine Fibroids I will not take a second shot as along with the heavy bleeding continuing as before I have severe pain extreme fatigue weight gain even after increased physical activity
592,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41089,14,Im and Ive been on the Depo shot since I was about or so about years now I havent had any side effects whatsoever I dont spot to often only when its about time to get my shot again which I think is pretty normal My only concern is the osteoporosis I am going to be going this next week to get a test done It just worries me because I get all this negative feedback from people I really dont want to be one of those But I can say my sex drive is high I dont gain weight I dont get acne what so ever if anything it has helped So all in all its a pretty positive experience
593,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,41087,10,I did one cycle of the Depo shot and at first I wasnt suffering any side effects I felt fine and really it was so much easier than taking a pill every day Naturally on OrthoCyclen I forgot all the time So the shot was refreshing and just plain easy to be on in that aspect After about a week and a half I started to notice an increased appetite Im talking I was hungry ALL THE TIME Also I experienced severe acne I went from having a break out maybe once a month to my face being covered in acne I didnt experience any weight gain but I was also doubling my workout time because of the appetite increase
594,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,8,41085,32,I am yrs old and Ive been trying to get pregnant since February My last menstrual period was March and I never had period after that Ive been going to my Obgyn for the past months and finally she prescribed me Provera for days once a day pill And i decided to use ovulation predictor kit days before I took my st pill last June On my rd day of taking my pill my ovulation predictor went positive it gave me a smiley face On my th day of Provera I experienced a very weird dreams hot flashes PMS backache a little dizzy I had my last pill June Friday and this is my day off of it Im hoping that I could get my period soon so that way I can start taking Clomid
595,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,9,41073,29,Took two pills a day for ten days and started my cycle three days after the last pill Felt nauseous the first day of taking the pill but it did what it was supposed to do so no real complaints Not sure if my cycle will regulate in the future though
597,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,41069,23,After two months on the shot I started to bleed spotting and breakthrough bleeding is not uncommon but this was much more My doctor kept telling me to stick it out that it can take up to months to stop after months of almost everyday bleeding we decided to call it quits It does wonders for some but didnt for me
599,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41060,9,I thought this would be a great option Well I was definitely wrong I was on the patch when my parents found out I was on birth control subsequently they took the rest away I went to my school clinic and received the shot the same day for free I did not have to worry about prescriptions or about hiding my patches anymore which was great and all Until the first week in I felt fine then something just dramatically changed with me I had no sex drive pain during intercourse pounds of weight gain for the first two months and for the third month and spotting daily I also had terrible mood swings and migraines I felt depressed from the weight gain I wasnt me anymore
600,Medroxyprogesterone,Renal Cell Carcinoma,7,41059,14,I was diagnosed with Polycystic ovarian syndrome after thinking I was pregnant because I hadnt had a cycle in months My ob ran tests and found I had a hormonal disorder PCOS and to force a period prescribed me Provera once a month for days It made me have all the regular PMS symptoms but I also have experienced prolonged heavy flow
603,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,41039,6,I was on the shot for almost years since my doctor didnt want me on the pill because I have high blood pressure due to my first pregnancy Well it backfired I gained pounds after starting the shot became extremely depressed mood swings and my sex drive completely gone Also I am blonde and my leg hair turned brown I have been on the shot for almost months and have started spotting very little and acne on my back migraines and wicked cramps
604,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41027,3,I decided to take the Depo for birth control instead of the pill because I am terrible at remembering to take it daily The first month I had no problems it worked great Now in the second month I had two weeks of spotting and now another week of a full period continues I plan on switching birth control methods next month
606,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,41023,5,I have been on Depo for months now and Im pretty satisfied with it I have had no bleeding problems no weight gain or any bodily pain The only problem I have had with the shot is that I have definitely experienced mood swings I am one of the most levelheaded people I know and within the first week of being on the shot I was more emotional than Ive ever been in my entire life I drove my family and boyfriend absolutely crazy I eventually got accustomed to the hormones but even now every few weeks I have days where I fly completely off the wall or just cry for hours for absolutely no reason It happens infrequently enough that taking Depo is still worth itThis is definitely a quotyour mileage may varyquot birth control
607,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,41023,2,I used it for months shots and never had a period or spotting or cramps or anything I have been moody and depressed but I dont know if its from the shot No weight gain But you cant lose weight either I didnt have a bad experience at all
609,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,41008,8,I have had only two shots and have horrible mood swings Im ALWAYS angry or upset at something and Ive lost all desire for sex putting a strain on my relationship The only thing good I can say is not having to remember to take a pill
610,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,41007,4,I have almost completed my nd month round and will not get another shot I have to work hard and eat right just to keep from gaining even more weight its very hard to lose I developed acne I never had before Recently I have been getting daily Charlie horses in my vagina very painful Very dry have to use lubricant every time and almost no sex drive at all Already had painful sex before but this has made it worse The only good thing is only having to remember it every months
611,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40984,3,Was on the shot for about years Loved it Not bleeding no cramps and I still had my very active sex life Towards the end of that years I realized I gained about lbs Thats a lot for me I have very high metabolism Then my hair started to thin out I had to stop taking it I cant seem to lose the weight which is annoying Now Im on birth control pills I dont like it at all No sex drive and some acne and serious mood swings Did I mention no sex drive If the pills dont work after months I am going to consider going back to the shot
612,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40984,7,I am years old I have been on the Depo since I was I got on it after my week check up When I first started on the Depo shot I was a very mean person I have NEVER in my life been like that I am a very nice laid back person I gained lbs withing the first months I am not a big eater and I do eat healthy for the most part I also had pregnancy like symptoms headaches and bloating After a year of being on the Depo my mood had changed and I became back to myself and my body got used to it I really really LOVE the Depo shot but I am thinking of switching to another method I love how I havent had a period in years and it is effective but I cannot deal with it making my weight go up and down Overall minus few things I love it
614,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40971,10,I have been on Depo for two months have not had a period my acne cleared up and I lost two pounds Fantastic birth control
618,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40939,4,Ive loved being on the Depo shot I have had no problems and not had a period since being on it for a year Its a very easy form of contraception and doesnt cause me any problems No weight gain or sickness
619,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40933,5,Have been having terrible reaction to this medicine Chest pain and shortness of breath
620,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40930,6,I had a very bad expirence with Depo I was on it for months and bled for months straight What a nightmare It also caused painful sex I had terrible mood swings and also gained weight The only good thing about depo is you dont have to worry about taking it every day or month
622,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40918,3,I was on the Depo for two years and was awesome for the first months I seriously thought I was in heaven I still had periods but had absolutely no cramps at all which is saying a lot since I had horrible pains before and the bleeding was light I started the Depo because I couldnt remember the pill Things were going well and then I started a period that lasted for a year I would have stayed on the Depo regardless of the bleeding but it was the horrible mood swings that made me stop using it I was seriously a miserable person Though this was my experience it could be different for others My body never reacts the way it should Really the only way to know is to try it yourself
623,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40917,5,Started this birth control when I was am now Had my period for about weeks when I first started but have not since Only had spotting if I was getting close to being late for shot Did not gain weight like a lot of people claim Have not had bone density loss but have taken calcium supplements No period no cramps no babies love it
627,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40082,40,I became pregnant with twins as I was not informed to refrain from sexual activity for weeks
628,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40079,43,Been on the Depo for years now No periods Terrible weight gain Mood changes Im looking to get off of it
629,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40071,3,I was on the Depo for about years and after some initial spotting about months I loved it Super easy nearly painless very effective If it werent for the bone loss controversy Id still be on it I didnt notice any side effects my period was replaced by light spotting about weeks before I was due for my next shot
630,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,7,40070,14,I had been on Depo for years as a birth control method I knew that there was always something wrong with doctors They just told me that I had bad period cramping and basically to deal with it It is only now after I stopped the Depo to try and fall pregnant that doctors have now tested me for and confirmed that I have endometriosis The pain that I am in now is crazy but I am not going to go back on it in the hope that I may just by chance perhaps fall pregnant It worked really well for me when I was on it though had no cramping as my periods had stopped completely
631,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,40053,35,Stopped getting my period so I took this and it worked right away It didnt bring back my monthly cycle but it brought on a cycle after the last pill
632,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,40052,51,Depo has been great for relief of pain from endometriosis I am on my rd shot No more period but I do spot the whole month before the next shot is due I am hoping that will stop as my body gets used to it more The shot is painless the only side effect I have noticed is minor weight gain and my sex drive has decreased a bit I am okay with that at least the pain is gone I got scared reading what everyone had to say about this drug and almost didnt get it I am glad I took the chance to see how quotIquot reacted to it Everyone is different I am very satisfied with it
636,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,40024,29,I have been bleeding for six months now I was on the Depo for three years then I went off of it I am lb heavier and my eating habits and work outs never changed I felt horrible all the time headaches back pain As birth control it sure works great
637,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40023,0,I have been using this since the birth of my second child and years ago I love it No periods No daily medicines to try to remember I have had a bone density scan and it was normal so worries there either I think it is great
639,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39995,20,I have been on DepoProvera for or years and love it I started out with very few periods and all of them were very light Now I normally will lightly spot or clot before my next shot is due Now I never have any periods so its been great The only problem Ive had is just recently for my last shot I went to a different doctor and they gave me the generic version which caused me to bleed very heavily and severe cramping so I know to never use the generic form again
640,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,39972,79,It started off great for the first month But then by the second month my period became a monster It lasted for so long and started on a very random day that wasnt even close to my regular period cycle date Also Im on an emotional roller coaster ride and almost constantly angry at something or someone I dont like this at all
642,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,39961,10,I tried Depo for almost a year before finally switching to the pill due to repeated irregular bleeding And the symptoms I experienced were incredibly heavy and painful like Ive never experienced It worked great as birth control though and I didnt ever get pregnant but there was no prediction or pattern to my irregular bleeding and the pain of the cramps was something Ive never experienced since
643,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,39942,30,After years on DepoProvera I decided to stop because I was concerned about not having my periods My period didnt come back to normal until after months during this time off Depo I realized that suddenly my mood had improved and I wasnt sad all the time anymore I switched to Alesse and now realize how bad Depo was for me It made me moody all the time
644,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,39936,18,I first started DepoProvera due to irregular and heavy menstruation The first month was the worst with several side effects that did go away after the second shot I had severe breast tenderness with some lymph node swelling mood swings and constant spotting for the first month After the inital shot I never had a period again barely any spotting and felt well I did go off the shot for a while and now I am on it again I am having no side effects except for the initial moodiness and decrease interest in sex But I would still recommend this product for someone No periods Sign me up
645,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,10,39923,3,I have used Provera for four years and have never suffered from any side effects The only draw back is that my doctor insists that I have a period every months I take mg times a day and this stops my periods and therefore all the problems that are associated with endometriosis I only wish I could take the pills permanently
646,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,39915,106,I had nothing but negative effects from the Depo shot that are continuing even after the duration of action of the Depo I am now experiencing terrible migraines I rarely if ever had even minor headaches They have been occurring multiple times per day including nausea and diarrhea I experienced these same symptoms for the first time after I received my first shot I also experienced neck stiffness severe mood swings bouts of depression that seemed to arrive from nowhere no sex drive what so ever and worst of all menstrual bleeding for an entire month straight which was only counteracted by a high dosage of birth control pills
647,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39901,8,I am and have been on the shot for a year now I already have kids and this form of birth control seems to be very effective I cant remember to take the pill so the shot is great for me The only problem I have with it is I cant seem to lose the pregnancy weight from my second child But I rate it a
648,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,39897,73,I am and this is my second time on Provera The only side effects I have noticed are intense night sweats I am hotter than usual The day after my first dose I was nauseous and had a headache like a hangover it has happened a few other times during the days I do think that I can live with days a month of the Provera because I was bleeding a lot I was stuck at home At least now even if I dont feel good I can still leave home
650,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,40908,62,I am and I had my period for weeks straight so I went to the doctor and they told me I lost so much blood I had to get a blood transfusion then they put me on Provera mg x a day for months At first it stopped the bleeding for a month but then the Provera stopped working so my Dr switched me on birth control and that doesnt work either Ive been bleeding for a month now I dont know what to do
651,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40907,1,I have used it without scares for years I have found my libido seriously lowered No periods once I got past the initial or jabs Worth persisting May have some bleeding if you are late for a shot For the first few shots bleeding can be heavy and irregular but this seems to usually settle after about shots and I had no periods after that time unless I was getting late my shot late
652,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40879,5,In the beginning I thought this form of birth control was great I didnt have mood swings and didnt have a period After using this for a while I gained about lbs and had the hardest time losing it
653,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40874,1,Im twenty years old and Ive been on this birth control for over two years and have never had a problem with it Ive always had irregular periods and when I did have them I was in immense pain but since Ive been on the Depo shot I havent had any spotting or a period and its wonderful First week or so I had mood swings but that was all A in my book Also I havent had any bone density issues
654,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40873,15,I have been on this shot for almost years now starting out just to help with abdominal pain and now for use of birth control I love that I have never had a period let alone spotting no cramps nothing Just recently I have been having terrible headaches that make me nauseous I have gained at least lbs which is very depressing and sex drivewell thats long gonewhich seems very odd for a year old Reading the reviews helped a lot thank you
656,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40870,4,I have been on DepoProvera for almost four years I have generally loved it No periods and really no side effects I never experience a lowered sex drive and I live life normally with the exception of no period The only downsides are that I find myself constantly taking pregnancy tests because Im afraid I may be pregnant and not know it and Ive gained about lbs although I cant say it was completely the shots fault I am now looking for another form of birth control so that I will not be kept from losing weight just in case I gained because of the shot
659,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40861,4,I have been on Depo for at least yrs No menstrual cycle at all I LOVE THAT I stopped receiving the injection June still do not have my period I am so anxious about having children I cant wait No real side effects coming off of the shot just yet Im waiting to lose that weight they said I gained on it
660,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40859,8,Im a person that constantly forgets to take her birth control pill So I thought all of the side effects would be cancelled out by not having to remember to take them I was wrong Within the first month I had literally NO sex drive Within the second month I became INSANE The mood changes had me crying daily and arguing with everyone around me I also started a light period that lasted for the next two months off and on The worst part about it was that when I decided to not get the shot again the side effects last for at least another months or more Plus I ended up gaining within the three month period about pounds Worse decision I ever made My gyno tried to warn me about it but I didnt listen Seriously consider the pros and cons of this
661,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40852,9,Im and have been on Depo for about years Yes I get moody but I have a mood disorder so it could be that Yes I break out but its not absolutely horrible and I kind of always have had acne I think I may have spotted a couple of times but only for a couple of days so far Unsure about bone density since I havent had a test done yet I love not having a period or having to remember to take something more often than every months I think its important to keep on schedule with it none of this off and on stuff No weight gain at all on it Definitely no lowered sex drive Only complaint it can be scary not getting your period But you can always take a test Also remember its different for everyone
662,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,6,40846,3,I havent gotten my period in a year I got my first period when I was and I was a regular until I turned Im now I was taking this medication mg daily for days I finished them yesterday My Doctor said I was supposed to get my period around the seventh day I still havent gotten it but Im hopeful because I have leg pain and my breast are tender since yesterday those are signs I usually get before my period
664,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40836,21,Ive been on the Depo shot for a yr and a half now and I have been bleeding ever since I took it I have experienced a lot of weight gain and depression and tons of moods swings You get cramps everyday as if you just got your period I wouldnt recommend it if you dont like bleeding Might work for some people but not for me
665,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,7,40835,22,I gave it a out of because I didnt experience any side effects so that is great and I havent gotten my period YET I took Provera for days and this is my nd day off of it I feel something going on in there so I have a feeling Aunt Flo will be visiting soon then I get to take my Clomid
667,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40823,6,This shot has caused numbing of my writing arm I am chronically fatigued All I want to do is sleep My appetite is enraged and I am having to be very careful about what I eat as I have already gained six pounds I am worried that the fatigue is permanent as other women I have come across have permanent chronic fatigue
669,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,40817,15,Ive had endometriosis for over years and have had about enough of the pain and the accompanying anemia from blood loss In the last years my blood loss from the endometriosis has increased tenfold and I have developed severe iron deficiency anemia My OBGYN and I decided to try Depo again last time was in the early s and I had my first shot in July of August was HEAVEN No period and my iron levels tested almost normal I was human again Now its September and I have had a quotperiodquot in quotes because its more like a normal womans period for over days and I feel like I have been hit by a Mac truck No endometriosis pain but my iron levels are so low from bleeding that all I can do is sleep When it works its fantastic
670,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40815,5,I was on Depo for years Zero periods in that time I did have a bone density scan after years and that checked out fine I went off of the shot one year ago It took me about months to get a period and now it seems my body is making up for years of missed ones I have had some serious hormonal swings over the past year but overall the period is the only thing I can see that is different I am ready to go back on Depo until menopause
671,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,1,40812,18,Ive only taken one shot it has been somewhat of a last ditch effort to provide some pain relief from endometriosis and polycystic ovaries The first month was great no pain and very little spotting The second month has been horrible I had a period for weeks and the other I had spotting along with horrible at times pain that even Lortab wont fully control Doctor gave me estrogen to stop bleeding and that took a week As of now I am not taking another shot I told my husband that I can feel this bad for free If this third month goes okay I may reconsider Ive tried everything and its badlooks like hysterectomy is next step
672,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,40806,2,I just recently got on the shot I had unprotected sex within the third week prior I havent started my period and its scaring me a bit Ever since I got on the shot Ive realized Ive had multiple nose bleeds Im not sure if this is from the shot My sex drive hasnt decreased a bit But I seem to be drier than before
675,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6,39886,105,I am a year old female In January I had a light period that lasted for days and then stopped Five days later I started bleeding again I had such a heavy flow with clotting that I had to change every hours After the th day I began to get very weak My mother convinced me that this was not normal and to see a gynecologist On day of this heavy bleeding I went to the gynecologist She told me I was going through menopause and prescribed Provera On the next day I was to take mg for days After days I stopped bleeding On day my doctor told me I needed to do this for the next months and each month would get better and it would help me through menopause I do not feel good at all when I take the Provera
676,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,3,39877,21,I had extreme nausea and vomiting within a week of getting my first and ONLY shot of DepoProvera
677,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,39865,16,I was on Depo for about months and started having a period for months on end Im also a kidney failure patient so that doesnt help things But everyone I talk to says they have a period for a long time
678,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39850,43,I have used DepoProvera since I was It started to control my period as it was irregular and ended up years later as birth control I have never had a period since my first injection also never had any side effects This is an awesome idea for someone who is irregular or just hates that time of the month The only bad side to this medicine is I have lost a lot of bone density in the years I have used it My advice is take lots of calcium while using this drug Other then that its great and I have recommended it to others in my years of using it and will continue to
681,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,39824,45,I have used Depo for years for Birth Control and to help with other uterine issues heavy bleeding etc I have never had side effects and its wonderfulno periods Talk about convenient Ill never switch
682,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,39819,107,I have not had a period from the first shot I had ZERO side effects and lost lbs I think it is an amazing product
683,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,39801,79,I took Provera about two years ago for days and it worked great for me I also had to take Clomid on day of my cycle and got pregnant on my third cycle They both worked amazingly I am now going to try again hoping to have the same luck
686,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,39778,58,I took Provera for days as per doctors order to induce a period On the th day I had a period The medication works alright I didnt experience any side effects
688,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,39743,67,Medication works by inducing a period After taking this medicine I had to take clomid and I conceived on my th round of medication It works Be patient and good things will come I am now trying again to conceive and yes I am taking provera again and I just started my st round of clomid
689,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,39632,6,Best birth control I have ever had
690,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,39515,252,I had abnormal uterine bleeding and I didnt know why I started passing clots amp was bleeding irregularly I thought at first that I was having a miscarriage I went to my GYN She prescribed Provera mg once a day for days I just finished my prescription amp the only problem that Im having now is sensitive breast Other than that my bleeding has completely stopped
691,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,40417,11,I gained a few pounds on the Depo shot but that wasnt too bad Was on it for years The first years were great although I had a decreased sex drive and the shots left my arm sore for days Had about week long period just before getting the next shot so about every months Bled almost constantly the last months
693,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40388,10,Love it It eliminated my periods for months and I clocked in regularly every months something that never happened in my life I would have stayed on it if it wasnt that I needed a pill with estrogens I had no side effect at all
694,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40350,5,Im getting close to the end of my second year on this birth control I have to switch because of the bone density thing but Ive taken calcium supplements the whole time so I dont believe my bone density was affected much if at all but thats just speculation I did gain a little weight in the last year but I was also in my freshman year in college so it may have just been my lifestyle change After a few months on the shot I stopped getting periods completely not even any spotting This may worry some people but I got used to it I have zero complaints for this birth control method overall
695,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,4,40278,26,I am now taking Provera for the rd time It works but I have had some extra hair growth on my stomach but I am willing to deal with that because I have been trying to conceive for years After I get my period under control I will start taking Clomid My husband and I are praying this time it will work
696,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40272,1,I love my Depo shot I looked forward to getting it every three months I am and I hate taking pills so my doctor told me to try Depo My periods are really painful sometimes and bleeding usually lasts for two weeks but its worth it The only downer is you can only have it for two years because of bone density loss I hate having to find another one like it
699,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,8,40245,14,I guess the only advice I have is for everyone on or considering this medication to weigh the pros and cons Ive been on the shot for years now and have recently had to have my frequency increased to every weeks versus the normal My cycle completely stopped weeks after my first injection I have only had a few breakthrough bleeds which have been treated with antiinflammatory drugs or and additional dose of the Depo I have had some side effects Ive gained about pounds but it showed up quotin the right placesquot I get very moody occasionally but Ill take that over amenorrhea any day
704,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40193,3,I got my first shot back in October and will not be getting another Since the day I got the shot I have been suffering from mood swings increased appetite I only gained lbs but it was in good places severe cramps bloating and headaches during my cycle or the week right before it would come on Many people I know who have been on the shot said that they had no period at all but everyone reacts differently to different drugs DO AS MUCH RESEARCH AS POSSIBLE AND ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS WITH YOU DOCTOR AND IF NEEDED GET A SECOND OPINION
705,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,3,40185,67,I was very unhappy on this drug My pain was not reduced as it should have been I spotted for the entire months I was on it I was extremely depressed had no libido whatsoever and gained pounds This did not work well for me for this condition at all Unfortunately once it is in your system you are stuck with it It took a full year for my body to readjust once I was off it and to stop spotting It was also hard to lose that weight afterwards
706,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40163,60,I have been on Depo Provera for about years and Ive loved it I havent had any cramps but I do spot for a couple weeks before my shot is due I never gained weight although I should note that I have a very high metabolism However my doctor recently had me do a bone density test and the results were not good Im and my bone density levels were very close to those with osteoporosis Studies show this is reversible once you are off the shot however the studies are not clear about the long term effects So unfortunately my doctor no longer wants me on the shot and I am currently looking into another form of birth control
707,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40162,1,Ive had the shot for a little over years now and I love it Only spotted for the first or months then every once in awhile after that It sucked while it was going on but it was definitely worth it I havent had a real period since the day I started no cramps or any symptoms of that at all Did gain about lbs Within the first year that was the worst part about it then I stopped gaining weight but no matter what I cant get the weight off at all Noticed really bad migraines about years into it Dont if it has anything to do with it Doctors dont have any idea why I get them but maybe thats why Other than that I love it dont have to worry about it except once every months
708,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,40161,71,Worked just like the Dr said I had been bleeding for months without stopping Took Provera for weeks and then started bleeding very heavily Bled for almost more weeks and have now completely stopped bleeding Just started taking Provera again for nd month It makes me a little sleepy and dizzy but it is well worth it to get my bleeding regulated
710,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,40136,4,Ive been on the shot for about years on and off What I mean by on and off is that I take about shots instead of shots a year I started doing this because after the st year of being on the shot I found out I had precancerous cells in my cervix Not positive that the shot caused this but I give my body a break for several months before I start again Every time I start the cycle again I get a different sideeffects I usually have a very high sex drive during the st month and I always have acne always have mood swings and depression sometimes I get headaches and I gain weight continuously regardless of diet and exercise
711,Medroxyprogesterone,Endometriosis,9,40124,17,Ive been on the DepoProvera injection since the inception of offlabel use for Endometriosis For the last few years Ive started having some side effects over the two four weeks prior to each injection including severe fatigue and hot flashes Ill take those side effects any day compared to how I lived when my quotEndoquot ruled my day to day life Ive been pain free for years as a result of the years of Depo injections Other side effects I guess we will see
713,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40116,1,Been on the shot for yrs Doctor told me Ive been on it to long so I didnt get my last shot in July still waiting for my period and they dont know what to tell me when I ask how long Never had acne before now I do and definitely gained weight As a birth control I love it Never had a period and dont remember to have to take daily pill
714,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40115,47,I am years old and I have had jabs of the depo in the last year and a bitMY PROS No period pain every month No babies three is enough for us No worries about tampons etc My CONS headaches alot Mood swings am a little depressed and snappy at the kids I dont want to get intimate with my poor husband at all and my face is covered in acne not really but for me YES I have gained weight kg I was supposed to have my next jab in June this year and I didnt go for it and I still dont have my period months later I think for me personally It is no good
716,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40664,1,I cant rate this a because it is DEFINITELY not perfect No birth control method is However I enjoy being on it What I like about Depo Provera is that its a shot I have to get every months its GREAT not having to worry about birth control inbetween shots I dont have to swallow or insert anything or worry about not taking it on time For me it also stops periods which is the number reason I love it the number reason being that its very effective at preventing pregnancy I got my first Depo Provera shot when I was to stop periods I kept bleeding and spotting and was told that would eventually go away by the nd or rd shot That didnt bother me
717,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40660,1,I was on DepoProvera shot for years straight I came off it for a couple of months but I went back on it again It was of great convenience because I did not have to worry about taking an oral contraception and to just remember to get the jab every months Thats what lured me into getting it in the first place I will admit that it was an excellent form of contraception as it stops you ovulating My periods stopped completely I didnt get spotting or anything maybe I was a lucky few but there was some side effects that my body and mind did not like I gained a lot of weight three stones and I had really bad mood swings when I was on it and they just were not getting any better so I decided to come off it December
718,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,4,40659,3,I started using Depo when I was and was on it for about or so years and again awhile later I loved it had no periods no side effects no increase in acne I didnt gain weight until I started it again around the time I turned and I think it was just the birthday not the Depo and stopped taking it around Now I am and started again I am on my first month injection and my hormones have been absolutely nuts I am driving my boyfriend insane crying and complaining all the time about nothing really I am halfway through this cycle and WILL NOT be getting another injection Over the last month I feel like a completely different person
719,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40658,3,When on the shot I experience excessive hair loss and a low sex drive
721,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40650,3,My experience with DepoProvera was horrible I had horrible mood swings and I spotted the entire months until the shot left my system Then my period didnt show up for months My face started breaking out not badly but enough for people to notice I also developed cysts on my ovaries that began rupturing and was put in the hospital for them It has been almost a year and my face is finally starting to clear up But I didnt get pregnantso I guess that is one advantage
722,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,6,40648,2,I have been getting the shot since having my rd baby months ago Honestly the st year was awesome No periods no mood swings and no weight gain Actually improved my moods and I lost all my baby weight right away I was also breastfeeding at the time As soon as I stopped when my son was mos old I guess the hormones in my body changed and reacted differently with the shot I started bleeding for weeks at a time I would bleed light to moderate for about weeks and then stop for about weeks and start up again Ive now gained about lbs and Im starting to break out a bit and I never break out Also my moods are definitely off I can really feel the difference Up and down all the time It was great while it lasted
723,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,5,40637,2,I have been on Depo for yrs I loved it the whole time but during this last year my hair started falling out I started to get bad cramps each month with no bleeding and my breasts became very tender and painful also I was not aware of the bone mass loss doctor never advised so now I have to get a bone density test
724,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40635,0,I had been getting the Depo shot for about a year I decided a few weeks ago that I no longer wanted this as my method of birth control When I first started getting the shot I had some spotting and no periods This has slowly increased and for the past two months I have had spotting everyday I thought I could put up with it before I realized that my libido had been slowly decreasing as well And for the past month or month and a half my sex drive has been virtually nonexistent I was not able to quotget in the moodquot No weight gain
725,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,10,40625,32,I am years old and I took Provera for days twice a day starting March th mg It worked for me About days after I ended the Provera my period showed up I am trying to conceive with my fiance but first I need my period under control I hope this all works out So far so good
727,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,40620,1,I loved DepoProvera while I was on it but coming off of it has been hard I suffered from depression and weight gain while I was coming off of it
728,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40619,5,I got my first shot in August and I didnt get my period until late October right before my second shot It is now March and I have not stopped bleeding since October Thats like six months The Depo has also made me gain twenty pounds and I have acne as well
730,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40611,2,The first few weeks after my first shot were great I didnt have any side effects My period came two weeks late the first month and after that all hell broke loose My period lasted ten days and ever since O have had a brown discharge It hasnt stopped in two months I also have horrible mood swings now I havent gained weight and not having to take a pill everyday is really convenient but overall it isnt worth it
732,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,40577,3,I got my first shot weeks after delivery I didnt have a period for a while but when I did come on I bled non stop I am still bleeding today which will make it days Although my bleeding has been light I am still adapting to being on my period everyday I was told that I could bleed for up to months I am just ready for this to be done and over with But on the pro sidemy cramps have lessened which is a good thing considering I usually have a hard time when its that time of the month
733,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5,40566,60,I started taking Provera January th because I had different periods in the month of December regular change every hrs to light barely noticed it changed every hrs to extremely heavy with huge clots literally changed everytime I stood up because there would be a gush of blood I was told to take it for about weeks and that I would have a period afterwards I stopped bleeding but I got my period a couple of days before the weeks were up The side effects Ive had are nausea seriously sick to my stomach the mere thought of food almost made me regurgitate and my body was extremely sore and it made me tired I still have pills and honestly not sure if I should still be taking it but I guess the pills work
734,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40565,10,Im and took one shot back in October my husband and I decided on trying for a baby within the next year so I did go for the second shot in December The first month was great but ever since then I will go almost a month bleeding off a week or so then another month and I have the worst cramps ever I am just now starting to get over the mood swings and depression My face broke out bad clearing up now I also gained Ibs and I know that was from the shot because I eat right and exercise I will never take this again and will never recommend it to anyone Now hopefully it will hurry and be completely out of my system so we can start making babies
738,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,7,40468,2,Im on the third shot of DepoProvera I have no more periods but the side effects right now are horrible I have headaches my stomach is hurting painfully most of my time Ive been having hot flashes I did get dizzy yesterday But I havent gained any weight in fact Ive lost pounds but my only concern is my stomach pain it gives me nausea I never vomit I only feel like it Its huge cramping and sometimes bloating
739,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40449,1,I have been on Depo for years now I had about a month of spotting when I got my st injection but I have since stopped having periods altogether It has NOT affected my sex drive I have gained a little weight but that could also just be the fact that my metabolism has slowed since Im getting older In the last year I have had a little bone loss and my doctor now wants me to switch to something else She has suggested Implanon Wish I could just stay on Depo
743,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,40793,18,The first three months went alright I was quite moody and emotional but nothing more than how I am when I get PMS It was bearable and didnt last too long I had one period for two weeks After taking the second shot I have had a period for over a month and a half now an actual heavy period not spotting My acne has gotten worse Im definitely switching to the pill when I am ready to get my next shot
744,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40791,3,I have been using this method of Birth Control for over ten years now I am hesitant to change to another form I have not had a period since starting Depo and never had a pregnancy scare I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise I would recommend this form of birth control for anyone who cannot remember to take a pill or who does not want to worry about getting pregnant Once every three months is easy to do and I have never been happier with any form of birth control
746,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,9,40774,1,I have been getting the Deposhot since and its been great I stopped having periods since the first dose which was a plus for me because I get really sick I didnt gain weight The only thing is that the shot is very painful but I will continue to use it for as long as I can Its very effective for birth control
748,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,1,40758,21,Did not work for me Secondary amenorrhea no period for months Age
749,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40758,5,I have been on DepoProvera for shots year and I have had relatively little side effects Before Depo I was on regular OrthoTricyclen pills and Ortho Lo On both previous methods I definitely gained weight at least pounds and was moody with total lack of libido I also got headaches a lot not really bad ones but annoying enough When I went back to get my prescription refilled I told the doctor about the headaches and that one of my eyes was becoming slightly nearsighted From these two factors she recommended the shot rather than the pill I had slight spotting then periods were gone after nd shot no headaches small weight gain and still less interested in sex than I would like to be but no birth control is perfect Try it
751,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40750,4,When I first started the shot everything was great I wasnt bleeding it worked as a birth control Then a month later I started bleeding heavily I bled for the entire month and longerI also suffer from bipolar disorder and this shot only enhanced both my manic and depression episodes I became extremely irritable erratic and finally I became suicidal After being hospitalized my doctor expressed concern that the shot had worsened everything If you suffer from any mood or anxiety disorder I strongly caution you against using this form of birth control I have used the pill before and never suffered such severe side effects with my mood
752,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,2,40750,16,While it did prevent pregnancy while I was using it it has also stolen every bit of desire for sex I once had putting a huge strain on my marriage
755,Medroxyprogesterone,Amenorrhea,8,40715,8,I was prescribed Provera mg days due to not having a period for several years and so my husband and I can have a baby Works like a charm Started period days after taking last pill st day was mild flow and all subsequent days were extremely heavy Its now day of having a period which is not normal for me even when I had periods and continue to have extremely heavy flow I will be calling my doctors office today as I do not want this to continue The upside is I did not experience any side effects while taking the medicine
756,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40710,3,I do not recommend getting this for your teenage daughter When I was a teenager It made me very moody and would get so so upset over the smallest things Now I am watching my teenage step daughter use it and she is the same way I am and have been on it for two years now and I finally stopped bleeding and spotting I have noticed its giving me muffin top and I am thin I am switching to the Implanon next week because my doctor recommended that instead of a tubal ligation I am nervous but so far I heard Implanon is the best birth control
757,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,3,40708,3,Works as birth control but for me the side effects were completely too much to handle Had my first shot about months ago and all was okay for the first month or so But since then I have had almost no sex drive constant breakouts and for the past weeks or so Ive had my period with severe cramping Making an appointment today to see about switching to the patch
759,Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,40700,34,years old have been on DepoProvera for about years now due to terrible awful debilitating periods the kind that made it hard for me to go to work I did get spotting the first few months but after that it was FREEDOM No periods whatsoever I didnt have any weight gain still around lbs and no other problems Im going to get NovaSure soon because I dont want to have to bother going to the pharmacy every three months and Im worried about the whole bone density thing although my doctor said she was on Depo for years without any problems I would recommend this for anyone who wants a longterm but temporary way to get rid of periods Dont suffer
762,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,1,40684,7,I have been on the Depo shot since April I actually got it the day after giving birth to my daughter Ive been spotting for a year now and still is Ive gained at least lbs I have no sex drive and I have lost about inches of my hair The only good thing is it does prevent pregnancy but thats about it Definitely switching to something else
763,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,8,40681,2,I have polycystic ovarian syndrome I have been using Depo since I was and I am now Even when I took the pill which regulated my periods my periods were abnormally heavy and I did not want to deal with it I like using Depo a lot I have taken a bone density test about months ago and my bones were great you just have to make sure you are taking calcium and vitamin D The only negative side of using Depo for me are the mood swings that happen after I get the shot and last for about a week or two I dont get any other PMS symptoms and I have NEVER spotted ALTHOUGH this is important DO NOT be late on taking your shot I did that ONCE and I had my period
765,Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,10,40665,2,This is a great birth control for most people I very rarely get my period and if I do its like about every months and its only spotting You dont have to worry about waking up everyday and remembering to take a pill I love this shot and I recommended it to a friend She didnt have the same experience as I did I love this product So all Im saying is everyone is different
766,Phenylephrine,Eye Redness,10,42477,0,Best eye drop I ever tried Provided soothing relief with NO side effects whatsoever Shame that it is no longer available
767,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42462,28,Really not sure why my urologist gave me samples of this drug since my prostate was normal for my age and my PSA was normal I was not having issues peeing just some discomfort Anyway I tried the pills for four days Nothing changed because I was still up times per night like I have for years Butthe side effects were immediate Stuffy head headaches and no ejaculate Not a drop Freaked me out Erection was not as strong and the quotclimaxquot took longer to reach and was literally a split second If you still enjoy sex steer clear of this drug Im am stopping immediately and will not return to that doctor As far as Im concerned I paid for nothing
768,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,42431,18,It reduces urination frequency but has a very negative affect on my sex life Im going to have to stop using it
773,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,4,42266,21,Having trouble emptying bladder so doc gave Rapaflo samples Increased flow within days but still difficulty emptying completely No ejaculate at all but orgasim still there Will stop Rapaflo regimen and try disposable caths for awhile
777,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42137,44,Im and have had weak flow for years It seems Ive tried every drug available but not much relief First dose of Rapaflo gave noticeable improvement within hours I thought I had found the solution until the diarrhea started Cut the dose to the mg capsule once per day and diarrhea solved but sexual problems set in No ejaculation Judging from this site this is not a minor side effect but almost a guarantee After a few weeks I began to have increasing difficulty reaching orgasm at all My sex life is fading fast Rated for effectiveness and for side effects
779,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42075,34,I am a year old married man I started on Rapaflo months ago It seems to have reduced my urination trips at night from about to or I can still have an orgasm but I have to focus harder and the subsequent ejaculation is dry Something I have never experienced before It does seem to be very expensive at for a day supply
780,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,42072,34,Prescribed by Urologist with samples for trial Found negligible benefit for the intended purpose very weak urine flow but severe interference with sexual fulfillment and inordinately high price I quit after six weeks
781,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,42057,37,I am a year old man who suffers from benign prostate hyperplasia I had to urinate to times every night My family doctor put me on Rapaflo It worked immediately now I have to urinate only once or twice at night It depends on how much liquid I drank The main side effect is that there is no ejaculation at all
785,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,41825,77,Fifty six year old male Obese but otherwise healthy Rapaflo mg once a day for symptom associated with BPH Rapaflo efficacy is measurably effective Serious downside is decreased ejaculation intensity AND retrograde ejaculation Dry as a bone Talk about affecting quality of life
786,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,41823,63,Started taking Rapaflo about a month ago after experiencing horrible side effects with Flomax I find that it only works well if I take it every few days and then it only works for about hours Taking it every day does nothing for me after the first hours However when it does work it reduces my nightly urinations from to about doubling my sleep The ejaculation side effect is completely awful though
787,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41816,82,Im years old and was diagnosed with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia last year I was my Urologists youngest patient BPH was so bad I was not emptying my bladder and was getting up at times per night It made work and home life miserable I had the TURP surgery coupled with a daily dose of Rapaflo and I cannot believe the results If I get up once during the night thats a lot Nowfor the side effectsIm not too pleased with them at all I have a very active sex life with a high drive While Im able to have an awesome erection and orgasm I cannot ejaculate whatsoever
788,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,41798,51,I have been on Rapaflo for months Results are mixed some nights Im up only once and others several times Consuming liquids in the evening makes little difference Sexually the only change is no ejaculation which is OK I guess but not great Dr recommends Avodart but the side effects of that medicine are serious in my opinion erectile dysfunction swollen breasts loss of sexual interest Not going there
790,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41710,48,Just started this and like it so far I keep waking up with morning wood and my erections are harder then normal Urine flow is slightly better and bathroom trips are less
791,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41644,58,Have been taking an mg dose prebedtime for the past days Symptoms of weak flow and seemingly incomplete voiding improved markedly within hours Only though significant side effect is retrograde ejaculation of which I had been forewarned but had never been previously aware Doesnt seem to make a great difference to the sensual experience while providing builtin birth control
792,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,39914,81,I like it because so far it has improved my flow over the rest of the medications on the market
793,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,40925,52,Yes it helped my urinary flow but the dry ejaculation and lower sex drive are a deal breaker for me Im going back to Flomax or using nothing I really like sex
794,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,40900,48,I have a somewhat enlarged prostate and was diagnosed with prostate cancer five years ago following an initial biopsy Three successive biopsies over the years have not shown any cancer However my bladder has apparently not been voiding as it should and after my last visit to my doctor I was put on a day trial of Rapaflo It has been moderately successful but not so overwhelming that I think I will stay on it I have had some slight dizzinessas well as no ejaculate and a slight decline in orgasm sensation Since I am still in my mids I would like to continue to have sexual relations that include ejaculations and a more intense orgasm I am assuming those sensations are a result of the Rapaflo
795,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,40892,66,GENTLEMEN YOU HAVE TO SHRINK YOUR PROSTATE Ive used Rapaflo for abouts months now Stops my urethra infections and gives strong stream Take it in combination with Avodart I couldnt grip my penis good to pee straight it was so small from lack of blood flow Yes there was retrograde ejaculation However you want to win the war Reduced prostate size and maintenance not a battle Im better than I was
798,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,40801,52,Doctor did not warn about the dry ejaculate so I was really spooked that maybe my system had shut down until I googled about it Otherwise the medicine did exactly what was needed Im and got a mysterious prostrate infection I did have to be at home with a catheter for days waiting for the Cipro to treat the infection and Rapaflo to let me pee Apparently good results based on the time I dropped my drawers for more strangers that week than anytime since college and was glad to do it
799,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,40784,28,Worked within first to hours Dry ejaculation stuffy nose feeling is better on my second week
800,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,40757,47,Rapaflo works great for me No really significant side effects Dont have the sex anymore just a wonderful understanding wife Sex is not everything I would rather have the flow
802,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,4,40712,22,Improved Benign Prostate Hyperplasia but not dramatically Side effect no semen when ejaculating
805,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,40579,58,Found Rapaflow impossible to tolerate bloating severe congestion very dry mouth tongue like sandpaper horrible sexual side effects no desire and no ejaculate Stopped after a weak It did not improve my symptoms at all anyway
806,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,40450,38,Rapaflo works just as well as Flomax in terms of flow and I dont get as dizzy or conjested It felt weird having no ejaculate and my orgasm was not as intenseas it was with Flomax
807,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,40437,36,Rapaflo has given me a very nice stream and taken away the pressure I dont mind not ejaculating its worth the flow My frequency and urgency are not improved close to months after starting Get up at night less Hoping to try it during the day instead of at night or increase dosage by mg
808,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,40388,59,Started Rapaflo three days ago Stream improved after first day Retrograde ejaculation today Some stuffy nose and some bloating stomach pain in evening Debating whether to continue Generally dont like medicines and do not take anything else Would like to have Benign Prostate Hyperplasia corrected surgically but am afraid Will give the medicine a little longer before deciding next course of action
809,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,40331,56,Patient age Have taken Flomax intermittenly for two years Urologist switched me to Rapaflo to improve urination and split stream No significant improvement for flow or split stream Within two weeks all ejaculate stopped Completely dry climax Discontinuing Rapaflo hoping ejaculation will return
810,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,40323,114,yrs old with moderate urinary difficulty up a couple of times a night Tried Flomax for a few months but did not like the stuffy nose light headedness sore muscles and crazy dreams Now taking Rapaflo with only slight stuffiness Seems to work consistently well It does cause complete anejaculation no ejaculation slight to somewhat diminished climax remains which feels a little strange but okay Overall Rapaflo works well and the pluses outweigh the minuses much better for me than Flomax
811,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,40320,62,Was using Uroxatral Rapaflo seems to work about as well but I also have experienced very little or no ejaculation very strange sensation
815,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,40027,46,Rapaflo has worked great for me I used to use Flomax and my doctor switched me I feel so much better and dont have the dizziness I used to have with Flomax
816,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,39949,59,I had been using Flomax for the past years and my urologist suggested I try this new medicine Rapaflo Well I took it for days and it became very difficult to urinate so I switched back to Flomax and all is flowing well again
817,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,39932,75,I am and have taken this for two weeks It has improved my urinary symptoms but has caused a side effect that I am not pleased with retrograde ejaculation
818,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,41585,41,Ive been taking Rapaflo for one week now wo any adverse side effects Rapaflo worked immediately to mitigate nightly trips to the bathroom I nowmake one or two trips and the flow is significantly much stronger than previously The only negative is that my PDP doesnt cover Rapaflo
819,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41568,86,I can only say it will make urination easier but it also will make a satisfying climax with ejaculation a fond distant memory IT TAKES A LONG time to wear off so you dont need to take it daily
820,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,41564,59,I started Rapaflo mg yesterday afternoon after my urology appointment Got up to urinate only once last night down from times a night I am impressed at how quotrapidquot it worked Stream is already stronger Orgasm last evening was same in intensity but produced nothing This really surprised me as I did not know it was a side effect Just hope intensity and drive dont decrease as well
822,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41539,65,Started to work immediately to improve urine flow and frequency However the side effect of retrograde ejaculation became extremely bothersome I did stop taking it for a few weeks and the side effect was completely reversed however the urine flow issue was too much of a problem so I restarted taking the Rapaflo again Same issues which I tolerated for a while but finally decided to go back to the Urologist and he started me on a new medicine
823,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,41515,63,Difficulty urinating Given a sample of Rapaflo by my urologist and warned about possible side effects no ejaculation Have been experiencing mucous and coughing and learned that this may be another side effect Flow is much better and if you can get over the need to ejaculate the medicine seems to achieve required resultsUsed Flomax for a kidney stone in the past with success but only short term One incident of bladder infection which was treated with Cipro by my family doctorAny idea what to do about the stuffiness or must I live with it Also on Lipitor and blood pressure lowering medicines cautioned the Rapaflo in conjunction with it might cause dizziness but it hasnt yet
824,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41509,24,Had symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia then a stone popped out Had both Rapaflo and Flomax on hand so I took the Flomax Great within hours and for the first few weeks then start with blood pressure issues I also take Avapro as a preventative to blown kidneys from being diabetic so they can BOTH lower blood pressure which it seems all of these medicines CAN do Not sure if I have a full blown case of BPH OR a moving stone as it comes and goes on its own and I never have night up and down issues Mine is what seems like unable to fully empty full bladder and then drip drip drip drip Flomax works within hours on me but long term has problems with the fast pulse Thinking of trying Rapaflo instead of Flomax when it flares up
826,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,41479,0,I am and have an enlarged prostate x taking Finasteride and have tried Flowmax and Alfuzosin The main side effect that is driving me crazy is Hyperacusis My doctor switched me to Silodosin and as usual it helped in all expected ways but still the Hyperacusis comes back Loud noises make me extremely nervous and it is difficult to be around people I may have to have the TURP surgery as I can not tolerate the side effects especially the HyperacusisNo one seems to have this particular problem but people as I do experience the throat and nasal symptoms I can tolerate the dry ejaculations but not the others I am considering going to a mg dose It does provide adequate flow
827,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,41454,49,Ive had a weak stream for some time but after a recent prostate biopsy I had extra trouble voiding Actually I was just dribbling and couldnt even get up a good stream In the mornings I wasnt sure I would be able to urinate at all After one day I noticed I was getting a little bit better flow but it immediately causes dry ejaculation I took a second day and developed a headache which carried into the third day This morning I was so tired and lethargic I lay in bed till noon I decided at this point that I would get off it and see if my energy comes back I believe I will have to opt for surgery and get this fixed
829,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,41370,60,The lack of semen freaked me at first but I got over it its like having a vasectomy my friends tell me But my erections are just as strong and my orgasms are better
832,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,9,41307,68,I have a prostate infection with an enlarged prostate and urinary issues I was given Flomax days initially with antibiotics but the Flomax made me dizzy and a bad stuffed up nose I was then given Rapaflo to help treat the benign prostate hyperplasia and felt only a slight stuffy nose and of course the most common side effect no ejaculation These side effects are common This medication is important in treating BPH and infections I now have no discomfort and urinate freely I still have two weeks to go I wont stop taking it until the days are up per doctors ordersFor those people who are worried about the no ejaculation side effect I have to say stick through and win the war It will come back Skipping or less sex for a month is worth it to get back to normal
835,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,41098,34,For me it works fair At certain times of the day I still have difficulty starting the urine stream I am sure I will have to have surgery before long
838,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,3,41057,60,To make a long story short Rapaflo worked making it easier to urinate and cutting the frequency in half However if you still enjoy Sex well there wont be any You can forget having any meaningful ejaculation After taking it for less than a week there was absolutely no ejaculate The frustration of trying to have sex is worst than the frequent urination to me So if your not interested in Sex its a good drug and it works well with little or no other side effects I also tried Flowmax and its merely a little brother to Rapaflo with pronounced Dizziness and muscle fatigue Neither is realistic for me But give them a try they make work better for you
843,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,43024,2,Seemed to work for about two weeks then wore off andsymptoms returned I would of had to stop takinganyway due to unbelievable nasal congestion Tried to stick with it for more weeks but since I could not breath throughmy nose had trouble with sleep also Also no sperm at allTwo weeks after stopping still some nasal congestion
844,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42927,0,I was facing difficulties in urination Every min there is urge of urination but only little urine passes All reports were normal Still my docter advised me to take silodocin and levofloxacinNow my experience both medicine have very bad side effects especially silodocin The main side effect is retrograde ejaculation I have taken only dose of both I dont know about the side effect of medicine so I was really very scared After discontinuation silodocin it took hour to go away retrograde ejaculation
846,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42837,1,I was having very frequent urination and some discomfort in my kidneys so I consulted the urologist he diagnosed me with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and no problem in kidneys and prescribed silodal silodosin capsules mg After few days the frequency of urination reduced however I am experiencing Retrograde Ejaculation and not a single drop of semen is released during sex I am quite scared and concerned about the impact of his drug on my fertilityI am stopping this medicine immediately I want this serious side effect to be mentioned on the medicine in bold and should be told to all patients who visit the doctor and prescribed with this drug
847,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,42831,20,Best drug out there for improvement in stream Worst drug out there for retrograde ejaculation and orgasm buzz killer
850,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42780,10,hrs old I started taking Flomax for BPH It completely blocked my sinus So I asked for something different My urologist prescribed Rapaflo but they blocked sinus was even worse and it cost me for pills Horrible medicine Avoid at all costs
852,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42773,8,I have just read through most of the comments here and find them accurate about the sideeffects no ejaculate while on it but stopping the drug ends that problem after a little while I had a procedure called Urolift where my urologist with local anesthesia inserted tiny devices that open up the urethra like shoring up a tunnel to create more flow During the operation in his office and while awake one of the little clips didnt attach fully and when I urinated a few days later it came out OUCH After that no more pain from it traveling out but lots of bloody urine for a few days Bottom line the procedure worked out well even with three of them implanted It has been a year and just had bladder infection cured with Cipro
853,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42716,17,For me it works well with some caveats Take it for too long and its effectiveness wanes around the week mark However when you go back it works in full force again I also noticed it was not needed EVERY day either skipping days worked pretty well too the second day just had a much lesser effect but still there Sexual effects YUP No ejaculate reduced drive All that This is not a big deal to me I am and my wife works the opposite shift from me during the week so sex isnt happening anyway When you stop taking them hrs later your back to normal So I just typically take them on weekDAYS and deal with poor urine flow on day when sex is a possibility
854,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42694,3,I am yrs old and went for a cystoscopy a week ago This was due to weak urination urgency to go to the loo and not completely emptying my bladder This was for years it was only until this year that it got worsehard to pee After two days in hospital I was prescribed Silodosin The first two nights it made me pee every hour With hardly any sleep I consulted the doctor and he told me to change to taking it at daytime Then the side effects kicked ini felt dizzy pain in lower back chest congestion first constipation and later diarrhea I know this may sound like way too muchhowever i never had this issues before Its making it really difficult to live a normal life I just want to know if anyone else has similar issues
855,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42668,14,After many months I lost my entire sex drive had hair loss very rapid heart beats shortness of breath all over muscle weakness sick to my stomach and rapid weight loss and loss of balance I had to stop driving I caution anyone about how the benefits out way the risks In will never take this ever again
856,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42648,12,Within hour of first dose I like many others on this thread had no ejaculate None It was pretty disconcerting to say the least As far as the BPH goes it worked I just cant justify taking something that ruins sex no matter what the reason
857,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2,42641,10,I have BPH and wish to avoid TURP surgery My urologist did ultrascans CT scans nuclear renal scans etc I have urine retention and that has led to one kidney having swelling He ordered intermediate cathing Have been doing that for months now My bladder is voiding to and retention is capped at cc More scans indicate my kidneys are doing fine now I started Rapaflo with Finasteride before cathing It did not help void my bladder So we moved to cathing I have no urge to pee unless my bladder has over cc So Rapaflofinasteride does not seem to be working I do have retrograde ejaculation Surely Rapaflo is causing it Urologist says keeping taking RF as it might take time Meanwhile int cathing is the plan
859,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42609,9,yrs old Had testicular cancer at left testi removed About years after I started having pain in between my scotum and rectum Was diagnosed with prostatitis doc put me on rapaflo Said it could take up to weeks for it to start to work First thing I noticed with in hrs was retrograde ejaculation Vary concerning at first then I read into side effects Thanks doc for not giving any heads up It took me about days befor my pain was lessenedand about weeks befor it was almost gone Now I can get away without taking it for days befor I start getting sorebut its a catch since the timing for me to have a normal ejaculation is about days off the meds days of use is not enough time for it to work prop
860,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,7,42589,14,yo male Frequent night urination not able to void the bladder completely Doc put me on Rapaflo and the symptoms vanished within hours Able to orgasm but not ejaculate Climax not as strong
861,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5,42574,19,Fiftynine year old Have taken Rapaflo for several years Diagnosed with BPH I was warned about the lack of ejaculate I was still able to orgasm Then I developed problems with orgasm My urologist said it was either low testosterone levels or psychlogical issues He said the Rapaflo was not causing the problem My prescription plan sent out a letter stating that the cost of Rapaflo would increase dramatically I talked to my urologist and he prescribed the generic Tamsulosin brand namd Flomax I get three months supply at a time I finished out my Rapaflo Then I started taking the Tamsulosin The return to orgasm and ejaculation was not immediate but I and the woman in my life are very estatic with our sex life now
862,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42573,10,I have been getting up times every night and finally decided to try medication again previously tried Flomax which did nothing for me Rapaflo after days gave me only a headache diarrhea and at best a flow increase I still got up several times during the night maybe one less time than previous The side effects and miniscule benefit made it a nobrainer to stop taking this useless medication A waste of
863,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,42546,2,I tried HytrinFlomax then Hytrin again then I tried Silodyx which works well except that no semen is ejaculated sex is normal with shorter orgasms its totally unmessy so my wife is happy
864,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6,42546,11,In I was diagnosed with prostate cancer tumors Underwent treatments of radiation My choice over surgery Had shots of Lu pron months apart to kill the testosterone and help the radiation do the job Cancer gone and PSA tests less than ever since Started taking Rapaflo mg every night and it helped me sleep at least or hours without having to get up to the bathroom so often I think the radiation hurt my bladder and the result was frequent urination Anyway to the point The Rapaflo works but I cannot experience a normal ejaculation But when I quit taking the Rapaflo for a week or more I can with ext ream pain both from the penis and the area of the prostate It is a burning sensation Have tried twice
865,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1,42528,2,Probably the worst medication Ive ever taken It had very little effect on my prostate but gave me swollen sinuses blurry vision fatigue muscular weakness retrograde ejaculation and no ejaculation
866,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10,42496,22,Immediate relief Seems to be very long acting I was prescribed Rapaflo mg once daily but seem to need once WEEKY I quickly know that once urine flow becomes a problem its time to take the medication
867,Silodosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,42464,3,yo male diagnosed with Bladder Outlet Obstruction The doctor put me on Rapaflo as a last medication effort for bladder retention The number of time I have to go during the day has went from to times a day Flow is unbelievably better Like the other reviews have said the main drawback is the retrograde ejaculation The strange thing is it comes and goes depending on the time of day
868,Resorcinol / sulfur,Acne,10,39822,3,Have loved this product since I began using it The price is great
870,Methylin ER,Depression,9,41568,113,Ive been diagnosed with ADD at the age of and have struggled with major depression since adolescence I currently take mg Methylin ER and mg bupropion XL in the morning In the evenings I take mg of trazadone for sleep weeks now and I have never felt better The adjustment period was pretty mild Just a bit jazzed in the morning and very mild nausea in the evening This gradually faded over a week My appetite is returning my diet improving and I am reconnecting sociallyMy sleep is good and I awaken fully alert with the sunriseI cant believe how dramatic this change is I am optimistic that I will be able to dig myself out of the hole Ive been in and rebuild a life
871,Methylin ER,ADHD,8,40974,29,My son yrs old has been taking this for about weeks now for ADD I was apprehensive about resorting to medicating him but as his grades and progress were suffering we felt we had to take the next step and try medication We have noticed a dramatic difference On the nd day his teachers sent me notes about how much he had already improved with focusing on his school work and having to spend much less time getting him to pay attention He is more focused and hasnt brought work home not completed in class since he started it Only one dizzy spell on the nd day of treatment and a little trouble getting to sleep the first nights but now he seems adjusted to the meds and is doing quite well
872,Methylin ER,ADHD,10,40772,11,My son takes this Best medication he has been on that works Just hard to get as its always on back order
873,Methylin ER,Narcolepsy,9,40261,20,I used Methylin ER for months I used the equivalent of a days prescription one mg once a day for months I did not use the pill every day due to illnesses and migraines Who wants to be alert for that When I did take it it was a different life for me I could actually plan what task I would complete that day instead of quotwatch and waitquot as it has always been for me with narcolepsy I am a stay at home mom with a year old and a year old In result my house was cleaner I was more predictable energy wise I did sleep lighter and occasionally woke up at night It was not bothersome though not to stop it Then the unfortunate happened I became allergic to it I am also allergic to Nuvigil and Progvigl
874,Methylin ER,ADHD,9,40106,4,My adult ADHD is the result of a traumatic brain injury This has been helpful with the ADHD but also with other symptoms from the TBI
875,Methylin ER,ADHD,4,39916,15,My doctor recently switched me from Ritalin LA to Methylin ER since it comes in a generic form and is much more affordable Sometimes I cant even tell I have taken the Methylin ER the performance is so substandard to the Ritalin LA
876,Methylin ER,ADHD,10,39837,25,It gave me back a life which I thought I would never have
877,Methylin ER,ADHD,9,39749,24,I was prescribed this for ADHD that was along with bipolar disorder I didnt take it at first cause I was scared because I have a history of substance abuse Finally I decided to give it a try The first day I took it there was a HUGE difference I was not as irritable as usual The quotchatterquot in my head quietened I was able to focus better on a few tasks I felt a little bit more confident than usual So far I havent had any bad things to say I have ECT once a month which helps a little bit with my depression and bipolar but this medication seems to do more good than any of that stuff
878,Methylin ER,ADHD,9,39582,33,I have been on Methylin ER for about a year and a half I still have a lot of difficulty with ADHD symptoms but the medication helps I can tell when I dont take it properly my symptoms increase I have only had to increase the dosage once in about six months I think that I need another increase now I have not had any problems with side effects My appetite is fine no sleep issues if anything I sleep better now no anxiety or increased blood pressure
879,Methylin ER,Depression,10,39528,249,Ive been on antidepressants from the old style to the newer SSRIs SNRIs and others and nothing worked My doctor suggested Methylin ER and my depression lifted in two days and I havent had a relapse Its been about a year now and Im still as happy as can be I dont sleep for hours or more anymore either I can wake fully rested with hours sleep and do anything my heart desires Methylin ER is truly amazing and Ill never go back to an antidepressant as long as this keeps working
881,Clemastine,Allergic Rhinitis,10,40205,11,I have used this medicine for a number of years for allergy and hay fever dust mold pollen etc and find it is quite effective for mild to moderate hay fever symptoms with no noticeable side effects For a long acting OTC remedy its relatively cheap too around for mg tab doses and I take tabsday
882,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41538,53,Between amp years old I suffered frequently with urinary tract infections and was all too familiar with the pain However about years ago I thought I was getting them again but all the cultures were negative for infection and no antibiotic would work When I decided to talk to my OBGYN about my symptoms he immediately mentioned Interstitial Cystitis and I tested positive for it They put me on Elmiron for about months and it cleared it up The only food that bothered me was bananas I recently had the Ablasion procedure which seems to have flared it again so I may have to take Elmiron again It is expensive but worth it to me
883,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41529,40,For years I was in and out of doctors offices explaining to them that I was having severe bladder pain the kind that makes you nauseous sweaty and feverish Finally I went to this one doctor and told her I had symptoms of urinary tract infections times in less than months I had tried changing my diet and nothing had helped She put me on Elmiron mg pills times a day and within weeks I could finally pee It has been amazing although I do suffer from frequent headaches even when we have lowered the dose as low as pills a week and exhaustion I had this before the Elmiron but it has been increased while on it I still recommend trying it it is better than nothing
884,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,41497,46,Ive only been on Elmiron for weeks But I did notice a decrease in symptoms pain is my only real symptom by week Now I am in week and I am almost pain free most of the time I dont stray too far from the diet yet but I do notice I can get away with more foods Id give it a but Im not sure how it will work in the future Doctors say that the sooner you start taking it after symptoms present and the more mild your disease the faster it works and the more beneficial it is My Interstitial Cystitis was considered mild and I was diagnosed within month of symptom onset I hope it continues to work I take mg a day
885,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41182,55,I suffered for many years with painful and frequent urinating I went to many doctors who kept telling me it was a UTI although each time the tests were always negative They kept just saying maybe whatever medications I was taking were probably just counteracting the results I lived on AZO Finally my gynecologist decide to do some other tests and found I had Interstitial Cystitis and this was in I was so relieved to finally have an answer I was then prescribed Elmiron I have been taking it almost years now and its helped me immensely I am still at pills a day some days I can get by with just or pills depending on what I eat and drink And although it is expensive it is so worth it I am just so thankful to be on the right track
886,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41015,62,It takes about days for it to start working and probably days for it to fully work However it does help prevent pain associated with Interstitial Cystitis IC I didnt fully appreciate it until I couldnt afford the medicine anymore If you call the manufacturer they can help you get a discount card to save on the cost
887,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,1,40875,29,Ive had Interstitial Cystitis for yrs Ive had cystoscopy surgeries and bladder tack All to have a diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis I have taken Elmiron on and off for years and I unfortunately do not get much if any relief Im only and fear that I am going be in pain forever
888,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,40836,50,Well it being the only medicine from my problem I felt better after weeks of taking it I had Interstital Cystitis for years I thought it was a urinary tract infection and took too many antibiotics Sadly the pain came back every time I have no side effects from Elmiron it helps me a lot also no weight gain or swelling
890,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,40689,61,Sure glad I researched and found this medicine All others were awful I do warn you though that Elmiron takes about months to work and I have to continue taking it forever I usually give up on medicines if they dont work in a week sure glad I gave this a chance There are zero side effects You must follow directions about taking an hour before eating and you must stay away from alcohol and caffeine religiously I found that if I stay away from irritants I can decrease dose to only one a day but as soon as I have a coke or beer or chocolate I get a flare up for a month or more
891,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,40644,52,My story is a different one I was diagnosed a couple years ago with an overactive bladder the urologist I was using said there was no way I had Interstitial Cystitis I had been doing research but he didnt want to listen Well I suffered for a couple years cause I was having a hard time finding another doctor and then finally just a week ago I found a doctor that listened to my symptoms and without hesitation told me I definitely had IC He put me on Elmiron times a day I know it has not been but a couple days but I feel different My urges arent as bad I am still having pain to some food but I am new to this and will learn I am very happy I finally about almost years of pain found out what was causing it and something to help
892,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,9,40565,39,I have lived with Interstitial Cystitis for decades and this is the only effective medicine that I have found to relieve my quotUTIlikequot symptoms when taken regularly I still have issues with some foods causing irritation of my bladder but for the most part Elmiron helps me not have to watch every little thing I eat
893,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,7,40492,44,I had severe Interstitial Cystitis which I had thought and the doctors I saw thought was an incurable bladder infection For six months I took dose after dose of higher level antibiotics while my IC got worse I also kept drinking cranberry juice and taking cranberry supplements When I finally found a doctor who knew what was wrong I had to start at taking mg a day of Elmiron as well as about bladder washes with heparin a week and I gave up all acidic foods It took about months before I felt better Now I am down to to mg a day I feel great
894,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,5,40416,17,I was diagnosed a few months ago My doctor started me on mg a day and times a week I went in for bladder instillation Soon after it became obvious that I am quite allergic to it I continued to take it with a strong dose of Benadryl but my reactions continued to get worse so I quit taking it about a week agothe symptoms are back Dont know which is worse What else is out there
896,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,40349,0,The only medicine that has managed my Interstitial Cystitis and helped me live a near normal life Without it Id be dead or at least severely incapacitated in a lot of pain and urgency
897,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,6,40310,22,I have had improvement on issues like frequency and pain but the medicine causes fatigue headache nausea weakness and swelling in my limbs
900,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,7,39968,60,I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in February Since that time Ive been taking the prescribed dosage of mg daily This has helped my interstitial cystitis symptoms tremendously I had suffered for a long time before being diagnosed properly so when this medication was presented to me and I took it for a couple of months my pain was gone I was so excited to finally get relief Unfortunately I had a recent blood test to check my liver enzymes The AST was and the ALT was both of which are normal between and My physician wants me to decrease my dosage of Elmiron and check me again in weeks Im very concerned about the high levels of enzymes in my blood Be careful and keep a check on your liver
901,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,39925,66,I have been using Elmiron since February I love it I think I did gain some weight but who cares I did not have as severe a case of interstitial cyctitis as some people but the medicine has sure been a blessing for me I have just recently cut back on it because I believe I have leveled off with the symptoms But just to be safe on that Ill be seeing my Doctor to be sure Dont want any flare ups Ive been able to eat again I eat just about anything I always did Mustard being my favorite Thanks Elmiron for helping me According to what I have read on interstitial cystitis mine is a mild case I do hope Elmiron will help those with a severe case I am so blessed and pray others will be after taking the medicine
906,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,1,42374,38,It took a long time for the doctors to find out what was wrong with be after endless testing and the distention of my bladder i finally got a diagnosis I was put on Elmiron and i took it like told waited the month waiting period for it to workand over a year later it still did nothing All it did was make me so constipated that I would go weeks without a regular bowel movement The only way I could use the bathroom was by using laxatives And the nausea was terrible My hair was weak and broke easily as well as my nails Not only did this medication not work but it caused even more agonizing symptoms
907,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42318,50,Being diagnosed with IC was a life changer I got depressed didnt want to leave my house unless I would be close to a bathroom I would have emergencies at work and get awful flares where I had to see me and get a cocktail which only lasted until I peed it out I have an abnormally small bladder and also urethral structure I have a severe case of the IC and Elmiron saved my life I get a moderate flare here and there if I splurge and have a coffee which use to be my life I dont drink alcohol at anymore Really only water now Spicy foods give me flares But on Elmiron they are tolerable and way less frequent Im so thankful for this drug as Ive tried everything else I always went into retention which would burn me up I love this
908,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42295,49,IC nearly drove me out of my mind I had it for yearseven underwent an experimental surgery to increase the bladder neck Worthless Considered DMSO infusion but did not want to put poison into my bladderFinally found a urologist who prescribed Elmiron At that time it supposedly only worked for about of patients Elmira totally totally worked for me Also never drink cranberry juice and stay away from all acidic foods One of the worst for me is watermelon No alcohol citrus fruits or tomatoes Its so worth it
909,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42276,65,Diagnosed with IC March by ER Physician I went to a UroGyno and was given Elmiron pill x per day and Hydroxyzine mg pill x per day Works for me I drinkeat what ever I want including drinking coffee and eating chocolate I have great insurance so cost is not a problem I have not experienced nausea vomiting or hair loss Please try it it might be the answer youre looking for
910,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42145,49,I thought I was having frequent UTIs the majority of my life I did everything I could think of to prevent and treat them The summer of and multiple negative UTI tests I was tested for IC and a test to see the size of my bladder Turns out my bladder was VERY large for my size I not only began taking Elmiron two pills twice a day but also had to retrain by bladder by quotgoingquot every two hours After about two months I started to finally feel relief that I had been searching for for over years I have been on Elmiron for almost two years I have dropped from pills a day down to and now down a day I stay away from lemon and very citrusacidic foods My goal is to be off Elmiron by the time I want kids No side effects
913,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42106,13,Its awesome
914,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,9,42082,38,I went to my gynecologist for what I thought were vaginal infections It felt like my vagina was on fire all of the time She sent me to a great Urologist because she suspected IC Sure enough I had a raging case of it He put me on Elmiron It took to months to begin working My pain went away almost totally I have experienced hair loss that isnt that noticeable I tried going off of it Big Mistake Ill be on it the rest of my life When I sometimes eat one of the foods not on the IC diet and experience pain I take a UribelAnother great medication Elmiron is a miracle worker for me
915,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,42067,45,I have been taking Elmiron mg since August after being diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis If I quotcheatquot on the IC diet I still have mild to moderate flareups but I am now painfree most of the time and able to have a fairly normal sex life I have not lost any hair and have found that the digestive sideeffects are mild
916,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,9,42062,21,I suffered from tremendous pain beinning at the age of and did not find out that I had IC until age At that time I was told that IC was untreatable and began using catheters However that lasted for maybe a few weeks A couple years later I learned of a urologist in the area who performed the hydroextension of my bladder which worked for a few months She shortly after prescribed Elmiron for me I currently take and have been taking for the past years mg twice a day mg total The pain has subsided greatly but I still experience some amounts of pain nothing close to before though I have not experienced any hair loss but want to try something different before such occurs
917,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,3,41986,29,I couldnt tolerate the tremendous amount of hair loss on Elmiron so now I take Vitanica Bladder Ease and Marshmallow Root for IC I prefer CystoProtek but its too expensive
918,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Bladder Infection,6,41971,15,I was on this medication months ago The first three months were okay no obvious side effects After a problem at the pharmacy I didnt have access for weeks and then continued on it for another months and I am having the bad abdominal pain and sweeping yet again This time it feels like a radiating infection type of pain Sharp pains in te front where I suspect my bladder is I am now having this bloody mucus instead of bowel movements I have also been experiencing hair loss in great amounts during showers This medication seems to work at first and then begins to wreck havoc in other areas after extended use I am on a strict IC diet so I know that that is not the contributing factor
919,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,8,41965,27,Not only do I have Interstitial Cystitis but I also have an extremely small bladder After the nd surgery to stretch it it still only has a capacity of mL My doctor just started me on Elmiron for the pain and will do a Botox treatment for the bladder spasms in a couple weeks Since I started taking the Elmiron I have noticed blurred vision I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or if it is unrelated and the onset of symptoms is just a coincidence
920,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41925,66,I have unexplained pelvic inflammationinterstitial cystitis In fact all the women in my immediate family do We are convinced its due to undiagnosed auto immune disease Taking the Elmiron was a somewhat challenging couple of months dizzy loss of appetite but after months it was all worth it Seriously changed my life urgency burning constant cramps amp pains muscle spasms gone
922,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41905,26,CAPSULES AT NIGHT worked for me after monthsBut the cost is outrageous
926,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41798,2,I live in India years of age I was suffering from urgency nocturia bladder burning sensation I showed to a urologist he did many tests including cystoscopy and doubtfully labelled me as Interstitial Cystitis but was not sure of his diagnosis so showed to more urologists over the span of next years who were very casually saying it to be chronic urinary tract infection urethral stricture as if they didnt even believe in ICs existencebut I believed I had IC then finally I visited an IC expert in Ahmedabad who confirmed IC gave me PPS mg per day amitriptyline mg per day amp hydroxyzine mg per day Im relieved within months now taking only PPS only bananas aggravate my situation Not doing any restriction on coffee and other items
927,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,41744,64,After having what I thought was a bladder infection for about months taking ever antibiotic there was I finally found a Urologist that was willing to work with me He did the scope and indeed confirmed I had interstitial cystitis He put me on Elmiron I still have flare ups but nothing with a lot of water and pain meds I get back to a normal life I have been on the Elmiron for years About months I decided to take myself off and see if I could get by without taking the meds VERY wrong decision I went back on Elmiron and thank GOD I am better now I have come to the conclusion I will always be on Elmiron However if this is what it takes to have a normal life then so be it

930,Metoprolol Tartrate,High Blood Pressure,8,42904,17,Had first bypass op in second a triple in I have been taking mg tablet per day for years now age I take half the tablet in morning and half at night my own method have found this best for me Have a little Fibrillation from time to time in the form of hard heavy beat lasting about half hour My blood pressure is good tending a little to the low side pulse normally around Have not had side affects that I am aware of

933,Metoprolol Tartrate,High Blood Pressure,10,42463,17,In summertime I have quotRepair of Ascending Aortic Aneurysmquot operation The mg Metoprolol is one of the main medication that help me in heart rate and hypertension The Norvasc and Hydrochorlthadize are other medication that cannot without it But the Diovan makes my heart uncomfortable It took me a year to figured out
934,Metoprolol Tartrate,High Blood Pressure,8,42018,111,This medication does keep my hypertension under control and also seems to effect my heart rate by lowering it by an average of bpm I take other medications that tend to raise my heart rate so this medication is useful for me in that regard I have found that this medication is very sensitive to dosing propery I have found that if I miss only a couple of doses my blood pressure and heart rate start to increase
936,Metoprolol Tartrate,Heart Attack,8,41848,104,Im a YO male in fairly good shape I started taking Metoprolol mg twice a day after suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this year in April It has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure and keeping my heart rate low The side effects are becoming unbearable now though Im tired and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning and have now developed a rash under my arms I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today and hes cutting my dose in half Im hoping some of these side effects will diminish when I cut down to mg twice a day

939,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42932,1,I have been on so many different drugs for my RA this one has been the best one yet I do have insurance but the cost with insurance is still very high a month My doctors office helped me to help from Xeljanz to pick up the difference
940,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42864,2,Xeljanz XR is the first medication to truly give me relief I has allowed me to live somewhat of a normal life None of the biologics worked and methotrexate was a bust with lots of side effects Ive been on it for months and an very happy
941,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42916,31,After failing all other RA treatments I was highdose steroid dependent and running out of options Ill admit the PML risk had scared me off from trying Rituxan sooner however the increasing and very real risk of becoming nonfunctional scared me more I began infusions about years ago While most patients receive concomitant methotrexate therapy I do not due to liver damage from previous methotrexate use Rituxan has improved my quality of life physically mentally emotionally My advanced RA will never allow me to live quotnormallyquot but I am the best me I can be with this treatment Side effects are minimal for me nausea for a few days after each infusion Thats my story
942,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,42841,22,I had first infusion with no problems during administration but weeks after I had to go to the ER with a heart arrhythmia and had to have my heart shocked back into normal rhythm Two days later had second infusion with no problems during administration weeks later same thingback to the ERheart shocked back into rhythm Heart rate was stuck at bpm Had to be put in hospital for days to be given an anti arrhythmic drug that can also cause a fatal arrhythmia So I would be cautious if you have any type of heart problem prior to taking Rituxan I will not ever take it again

946,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42274,72,Rituxan has completely changed my life for the better I was in a clinical trial and tried several other medications with some success but my symptoms eventually returned After four sessions of Rituxan over a two year period I stopped seeing my RA doctor because I had no symptoms I am now going into my th year without pain I am playing softball tennis and golf without any pain I highly recommend this drug to anyone dealing with RA
947,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,41805,83,Entering the th hour of the process during my st infusion I experienced annoying itching deep within my ears back of throat head and face Shortly after the quotpushquot increasing the drip I broke out into hives on my face head and neck with red welts ironically appearing in the areas where I had historically given myself the Enbrel injectionsfront of both thighs and stomach Enbrel had stopped its effectiveness after almost yrs and it had been almost month from my last injection prior to the infusion My Dr made the decision to discontinue the infusion fearing that my allergic reaction may cause anaphylaxis
948,Rituxan,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,41713,70,I had two infusions Both lasted hours I couldnt tolerate the infusion faster than mlhr I would get chest pain and muscle rigors MD refused to continue after that
949,Rituxan,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,10,41457,72,I was diagnosed with CLL I began Rituxan once the lymph nodes began to enlarge and my counts were doubling Initially I was infused once per week for a month I have continued with this infusion but moved to a monthly visit It is now July and my numbers have dropped significantly and my doctor has moved to a maintenance programinfusion every other month I have never had any side effects from the infusions and doctor is pleased that Ive not required chemotherapy medicines added to get same results Prior to each infusion I take two mg Benadryl and a Tylenol Perhaps these medicines beforehand have aided me I have no complaints
952,Rituxan,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,8,41307,38,I have gone through three rounds of Rituxan for AutoImmune Hemolytic Anemia triggered by early stage Chronic Lymphocytic LeukemiaEach time I have had initial reactions with the first dose My throat and ears get itchy and my throat starts to swell They give me IV Benadryl and have administered Decadron slowed down the infusion and I have done okayIt is very gradual improvement in my hemoglobin So slow that Im not sure it is working but my doctors believe it is The only alternative is prednisone which makes me completely hyper and unable to sleep Rituxan is the better alternative Unfortunately it is not stopping my AIHA just keeping my hemoglobin up It is extremely expensive though

969,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42891,17,Elmiron has changed my life I knew immediately that it was helping with my symptoms of urgency and bladder pain It is a little pricey but I dont even care Living with IC can be miserable and elmiron makes it possible to feel good again
972,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42755,35,This medicine has changed my life I suffered with IC for almost two years before taking it It worked a little after weeks of taking it but it started working incredibly well at three months I now only go to the bathroom times a day I was going up to at least times a day before that I can now drink soda and tea without a problem I still stay away from citrus and spicy foods as I am too scared to try those I have had zero side effects I take this pill on an empty stomach and then wait an hour later to eat I am a military veteran and am able to get this medicine from the VA for an copay

983,Pentosan polysulfate sodium,Interstitial Cystitis,10,42556,0,It took years to be diagnosed with IC I had urge to urinate My urologist did a cystoscopy and found Hunners Ulcers and immediately gave me a script for Elmiron Elmiron worked really fast for me and I no longer had the constant urge to urinate after about weeks However it does cause diarrhea and I have suffered this side effect every day for the last years The benefits of Elmiron far outweigh the side effects

990,Torsemide,Edema,10,42457,14,I find that torsemide works very well for me I dont take it every day more like every third or fourth day The only down side is that if I take it every day I get very painful cramps in my thighs Now I take CalciumMagnesium and that seems to reduce the incidense of cramping If one does happen I also take a tablespoon of mustard recommended by Dr Oz on tv which has turmeric in it and that helps very much alsoTorsemide helps greatly with reducing any edema that I have in my ankles feet and legs Other than the occasional cramping I experience no other side effects and I will continue taking this drug
991,Torsemide,Edema,10,41890,37,Torsemide has really been effective in reducing the edema that I suffer from Pulmonary Hypertension IT really gets out the extra fluid without any harsh side effects I used to take LAsix furosemide and I had to be taken off it after I suffered painful red nodules all up and down my legs Furosemide was far more harsh than the Demadex and Im glad my doctor switched me to it

1019,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42984,0,I wasted pound on this garbage Would strongly suggest antibiotics instead of wasting both time and money
1020,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42980,0,st day fine nd day it made me SO sick Severe stomach cramps and I mean severe Nausea dizziness headache racing heart backache weakness and fatigue I havent used it for days and most symptoms have cleared but the stomach cramps and fatigue are still very painful MD said to go to emergency for stomach pain but its an hour drive so I opted to try to sleep it off Since its still ongoing Ill be seeing my MD tomorrow I will never take this again
1021,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42923,5,Earlier this year my skin looked downright awful with tons of redness with small papules all over my forehead I started using this once per day with Avene Skin Recovery Cream and my skin is clear less red Love
1022,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42918,10,When I first looked at the reviews for Rozex I was terrified because so many of them said it made their condition worse until someone reminded me that happy people dont usually write reviews So I wanted to write a good one I have acne rosacea so about minutes after I would take a sip of red wine I would break out in huge bumps that last for weeks Im a yr old in Ireland so obviously the idea of never drinking again was troubling but so was the thought of having horrible acne after so many years of nice skin I started rozex a few months ago and the effects came in semislowly maybe a month or two but now it works amazingly I dont even worry about it anymore I can go on a huge night out and wake up with great skin
1025,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,42883,16,Im and have had rosacea untreated for about yearswith pustules mostly the last yearsone doctor telling me it was adult acne Anyway it got really bad after changing my diet to keto and I knew it should have cleared my skin up but the pustules got so bad My Dr prescribed the generic gel and within two weeks the pustules were completely goneband another two weeks and skin texture is wonderful but the redness remains on my cheeks so only Im going to ask my Dr about something else when I go back for the redness Id like to know why I waited so long to treat it This worked great and my skin hasnt been this clear ever in my life No side effects that I can tell
1026,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,2,42878,2,I was diagnosed with BV and was prescribed Metronidazole Vaginal Gel After my treatment I saw little to no improvement in my symptoms I have had BV once before however this was my first time using this specific gel It also caused an unpleasant discharge sort of like white thick wet toilet paper I was prescribed Clindamycin vaginal cream before this case of BV This cream was more effective It relieved and got rid of my BV completely I went to the gyno again yesterday and she prescribed me Clindamycin Most of my symptoms have gone away I dont recommend Metronidazole gel Im not sure why it didnt work for me It was definitely a waste of money Clindamycin vaginal gel is better
1027,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42873,2,Ive had BV a few times usually after I sleep with a new partner Every time I have been on this medication it works like a charm I am on day and I noticed yesterday all symptoms are completely gone Ive had the cream in the past and would say I prefer the pills Just less messy Also no bad side effects for me Ive been taking them with food and probiotics and have felt fine Ive refrained from alcohol as recommended Very happy with this treatment
1028,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,42871,2,I was prescribed this to treat BV I would take the first pill around after a meal and the next around dinner time I had no bad side effects I was taking it while on my period on day I came off of my period so far no signs of BV But Im looking forward to seeing if my BV is really gone being that I was on my period while taking this If this has cured my BV I will rate it
1029,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42867,15,I had mild to moderate Rosacea and started using the Metro cream two weeks ago I saw improvement within the first week Ive been using it twice a day after washing my face with Garnier Sulfate Free Gentle Cleanser I have dry skin so I then use CeraVe lotion with SPF in the am and CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream in the pm These combinations have really worked for me I think I am ready to cut back to once a day in the pm Ive been rather impressed with CeraVe moisturizers and the Garnier cleanser Im years old and was very frustrated by how my skin was changing having had pretty good skin throughout my life My skin is now clearer and brighter with no eruptions
1030,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42856,2,I havent taken any antibiotics for years days with metronidazole I felt it right away that it was working so well The fact that I dont take any medication made it super helpful Also eating the right food and taking probiotic prebiotics daily I know it probably doesnt make sense taking probiotics while on antibiotics I did some research its okay if you take the probiotics hour or more after you take the antibiotic They gave me metronidazole for x a day in days So what i did is I take it morning and night time and in between I take probiotics and enzymes I Also eat lots of fermented food like kimchi lots of veggies drinking bone broth and green juice Green tea is also good while on antibiotics
1032,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42821,10,I had mild rosacea when I started using metrocream It made me break out extremely badly all over my cheeks and nose I think it clogged my pores making the redness and Rosacea much worse Very disappointed in the setback it gave me
1034,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,42805,5,Very good for folliculitis Tried everything else Gave me relief after first application
1036,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,42753,21,I think this stuff is great I have rosacea that seems to run in the family worsened by the dryness of winter Ive been using this for a week and it works pretty well Apply it once before bed and another time during the day and my skin had significantly improved in redness The scaliness of rosacea is also gone Would recommend
1039,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42734,20,Garbage It takes it away for a little while and right back again it comes I been going through this for years now As far as Im concerned this medicine causes it to reoccur which I feel like the government and pharmaceuticals purposely did to make MONEY
1041,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,5,42383,3,I was diagnosed with BV by my obgyn and she prescribed me with Metronidazole mg twice a day for days I took the pill and noticed that my discharge lessened but My odor was still traveling around but it wasnt as strong Then as the days went on Day I felt dizzy and as like the room was spinning minor cramps headacheDay nausea cramps dizziness headache constipation dry mouth loss of appetiteDay I was vomiting all night and I decided to stop taking the pills and called my doctor in the morning because the side effects werent getting any better and my BV didnt seem to be clearing up as much as I wanted it to She prescribed me metronidazole vaginal gel for days And havent taken yet but will be reviewing
1042,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42326,8,Had BV for the first time didnt know what to expect but this medicine made me confident again and stop suffering from embarrassing odors
1043,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42316,13,Its great doesnt help the infrequent redness but keeps the skin clear for me just when I notice the flare up until it subsides The cost is exorbitant a tube g
1048,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,6,42240,22,This gel is amazing and I have used it on amp off for years but now my body is paying the price I first noticed each time I used it my hands would go numb then my vision began deteriorating with a stigmatism Now its at the point my hands go numb quickly within a half hour of using this Just be aware and careful I used it about x a year for years Cannot use anymore
1049,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,42238,46,The first time I got BV the doc prescribed Clindamycin and a month later it came rite back then he prescribed me Flagyl and a month later it still came back as well I felt like less of a woman bc of this I thought that I would never have a sex life again and i was hysterical then he prescribed me the MetroGel and after the first use symptoms were gone I was like a kid in the candy store he prescribed me like refills for if it comes back I made sure that he gave me enough refills I love it so far and I have a prescription for past nights to make sure it doesnt come back this works I love it better than the pills
1052,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,42187,33,Having foolishly used a steroid lotion on my forehead rosacea I had a real flare up when after weeks I stopped using it Horrible lumps amp lots of whiteheaded pustules appeared as well as larger red spots making me very selfconscious It hardly helped that I was about to head off an a week business trip meeting lots of new people I tried Azelaic Acid which seemed to make matters more inflamed Then having overlooked it thinking it was pretty first base I tried metrogel clear gel After days I thought I could see an improvement Within days it was clearly working no new pustules were appearing and the old ones were being shrunk down Within a week my forehead looked pretty clear days later it was fine Recommended
1053,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42177,54,Have been diagnosed with Rosacea that I have had apparently for years was not willing to seek medical advice and treatment due to money concerns Two and years since my last consulting with Dr And all I can say is I am amazed at the results topically applied Metronidazole gel has given me I am grateful for being able to shave my face without feeling like it was a blood sacrifice Only one regret why didnt I do it sooner happier now
1055,Metronidazole,Rosacea,6,42166,12,When I used the lotion I found that it did get rid of a few pimples It definitely does not get rid of any redness whatsoever Even though its the same thing I find the lotion to be more effective than the cream
1056,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42154,43,This has been a wonderful medication for me I was having BV monthly and it was impacted my sex life My doctor recommended that I use it after Intercourse and I havent had any problems since then Highly recommended
1057,Metronidazole,Rosacea,5,42148,10,It really hasnt seem to change anything for me other than it lightened a tiny bit of the redness Im hoping its just because Ive only been using for weeks Hopeful but skeptical been down this road many times nothing seems to work entirely for me
1058,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,42134,8,Okay i have tried the gel the only side effect is loss of appetite and a bad yeast infection Looks like i growing biscuits but the diflucan took it all away It work
1059,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42126,72,Ive always had a problem with odor and tried douching etc but nothing ever helped FINALLY I spoke with a PA who told me I probably have an over abundance of quotgoodquot bacteria which produces this odor She prescribed Metrodinazole and I used it as prescribed NO MORE EMBARRASSING ODOR I dont know how long this will last but I could cry from relief Unless you experience thus yourself you dont understand the thoughts always in the back of your mind So thankful for this medication
1060,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,42102,32,I suffered from rosacea for years but as I went through menopause it seemed to decrease in frequency However when it did pop up it was more intense so the last time I had an outbreak I finally broke down and asked my new doctor for something and he gave me MetroGel I was a bit dismayed to read the label that it could take weeks to be effective but like several others here I literally saw results after the first application I applied it at bedtime and was quite surprised the first night to find my face noticeably less inflamed the next morning and smoother I have used it several nights in a row now and my face seems to be healing from this latest outbreak much more quickly than I could ever have expected
1061,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42075,15,This really works this is my first bacterial vaginitis and was really freaked out but after talking to my doctor she said it was normal and prescribed this I am so happy and relieved
1062,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42050,62,I have found that Metrogel works wonders for me It made a difference the first time I applied it Applied at night woke up in the morning with noticeably clearer skinIt is recommended to use it twice a day but I just apply it once at night because it causes a filmy layer over the skin and I wouldnt want to go out in public like that and that seems to be enough for me
1063,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42031,68,Used gel for days The smell was gone the next morning Still continued to use it for the remaining days It made everything so much better Im glad they have this treatment
1064,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,41943,45,Day and night difference All the redness and the red veins are gone My skin looks fantastic
1065,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42729,24,I find Metrogel more effective than Finacea It minimizes redness and breakouts with no irritation
1066,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42721,12,My doctor took several vaginal samples and tested for yeast all stds and bacteria The ONLY thing that was positive was g Gardnerella which is bacteria She gave me flagyl MG daily x days and told me to use metrogel x a week for months Still not better and just finished weeks of the gel which is doses I have zero odor never had any but my discharge is like acid My skin around the vaginal opening is extremely red and it burns and sometimes I itch Im majorly frustrated I have used desitin and vaseline to try and keep the discharge from burning me so bad docs suggestion but those tend to make me worse Im truly so depressed I just dont feel like this is ever going to go away No sex for months now
1067,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,42708,0,Pap came back saying i had BV Ok was given this gel to use at night for days Ugh rd night stomach ache since day one will finish the last and hopefully i will feel better Today I though i was going to pass out Actually hope its the prescription and not something else It cost with my crap insurance Good thing for my health savings plan
1068,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42702,11,Day of rosacea flareup thought I was having an allergic reaction to seafood My face turned red and swollen my chest was covered in a rash I took Benadryl that did nothing other than make me sleepDay symptoms got worse with my skin hurting but realized it was Rosacea I had a tube of Metronidazole cream that I put on immediately relieving the pain Day skin looks much better today Started on Minocycline mg qid Couldnrsquot sleep because of itchingDay less redness and swelling No itchingDay and on cheeks still red but otherwise look normal Rash is gone After stopping the Metronidazole skin texture gradually returned to normal Irsquom still on the antibiotic
1069,Metronidazole,Rosacea,6,42697,8,I am amp noticed a change in my face after my second baby After breastfeeding I was finally excited to see a dermatologist Immediately was told Rosacea She prescribed doxycycline amp metro gel Within days I saw improvements but at my day appt I still looked red She told me to continue amp return in days I am nearing my appt with no acne but redness amp a slight scarring complexion My cheeks nose amp chin get really red from heat or spicy foods Ive noticed I dont really feel like the metro gel is helping much cause I always wear a little redness nowadays
1071,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,2,42649,17,Ive had bv off and on for years tried the day course multiple times Always came back in a couple days Was told to do metro gel twice a week for months This has kept it at bay but never got rid of it I was tested positive for group strep b was told I may have had this overgrowth infection since I gave birth to my second son years ago and that it could be the cause of the bv or the symptoms of bv After the penicillin treatment Ive noticed a slight difference but still having to use the metro gel to keep it at bay I take a raw probiotic twice a day as well I wish this medicine worked like it has on everyone Ive known to it This bv stuff is so crippling
1072,Metronidazole,Rosacea,5,42647,10,Initially had good response to gel but days after starting it I looked like I had a mild sunburn I then started getting multiple finger joint swelling with swelling redness and pain and then gastric problems Obviously having side effects Back to neomycin creme
1073,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,42633,28,I used metrogel for nights It worked great The itching and burning were relieved the very first night I took it I did have to do a sixth dose two nights after the fifth night because the symptoms came back slightly but since then I have been fine That was a week ago and since then no problems at all The only home remedies I had tried were the probiotics folic acid vitamin D and vitamin C I also ate a lot of plain yogurt I think the vitamins and yogurt worked to give temporary relief but ultimately it was the Metrogel that did the trick Crossing my fingers I dont have a relapse I decided to use the gel and not the pills so the drugs dont have to go through your whole body The gel just attacks the problem at the source
1075,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42611,12,Started the gel or so weeks ago for my rosacea and its just gotten a million times worse My cheeks are angrier than ever and Im even getting spots on areas that are normally clear like my forehead nose and chin
1076,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,42609,2,I did experience some side effects the feeling of menstrual cramping but not because I had a hysterectomy years ago diarrhea some vaginally discharge Nothing severe or unbearable
1079,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,7,42561,7,Ive been on the gel for days First diagnosed with a UTI with no growth Finished Cipro and still had symptoms Second round pelvic exam amp swab Still had bacteria amp yeast so was prescribed metro gel No side effects but hasnt helped my issue Waiting for nd culture to come back to see if still UTI and wasnt sensitive to the Cipro and need something new Pains from hell
1081,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,3,42559,5,I tried the Metro gel for the first time for Bacterial Vaginosis I have always used antibiotic pills before Using yogurt and probiotics I have never had a yeast infection after antibioticsuntil using the Metro gel I have never had a yeast infection so bad that yeast clumps were falling outuntil using the Metro gel The yeast infection began before I was even done with the Metro gel There was NO yeast present before the Metro gel A culture was run at the lab before starting any treatment and that is how the BV was diagnosed YI did not show at all on the lab result I will NEVER us the Metro gel again unless I am given Diflucan spelling pills to take through the gel treatment to prevent the yeast infection
1082,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42549,12,Used it twice a day for several months and it did nothing to help reduce the redness or bumps It cost as well and that was with percent covered
1083,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,4,42546,9,Tried this gel for night thinking it would have less side effects than in pill formBut I had a very bad experience Within half an hour of using my legs felt as if they were on fire mainly from my knees to feetGot worse with achingshooting pains up and down my legsMy head felt funny but no headacheAll night I barely slept cos of the severity of the painThe hotness did lessenstill had painful legs until mid morningbut it had spread to rest of body a dull ache as if I had fluHad slight blocked nose til morning as wellFelt slightly nauseousWas itchy too all overFelt spaced outSuffered memory loss in day before all went awayWill not take again as am allergic to antibiotics so is probably just meBV did feel bit better though
1084,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42542,40,I am and never had a skin condition Ever Heat stress lack of sleep all contributed to a redness to my face Now it cracks and peels and swells I started metronidazoleb and it clears up in two days Put non oily lotion over the top and I can put makeup on Yeah
1085,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,42539,9,At the age of my nose stayed to break out at the Time I thought it was acne but after seeing A dermatologist I was told It was rosacea with looks like acne with red spot and white heads I used the metro percent gel for one week and felt like it made it worse so I stopped After weeks my rosacea was at the worse it had been I tryed the gel again weeks on the gel and I have not got any white heads or and new spots I do have redness Only side affect is it seems as I am growing hair on my nose not sure
1086,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,42487,11,This medication did nothing for me
1087,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,42463,28,After nine years of no flare ups I suddenly found myself with the red cheeks and pustules I decided to consult a dermatologist who prescribed me sulfa cleanse and a very low dose antibiotic Within several days my face was extremely red raw and full of large painful pustules Heartbroken I decided to see my regular doctor and he prescribed me metro gel and a stronger antibiotic I saw results instantly From one day to the next my redness and inflammation went down to the point that I noticed it Now only days later my face is back to normal I am amazed at how fast the metro gel combined with the right antibiotics cleared my face up I am forever grateful to my doctor and metro gel for helping me smile again
1088,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,1,42454,17,Ive been getting bacteria infections on and off for about yrs have always taking the metrodonizole pills and they give me a bad taste in my mouth so this time I wanted to try the vaginal gel Did not work at all Plus gave me a yeast infection Now having to redue treatment with pills Fml
1089,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,2,42431,16,I was diagnosed with BV and took this medicine PERFECTLY for days After the first day I got severe crippling anxiety attacks which are very uncommon for me I also had an upset stomach cramps and diarrhea for a week The symptoms of BV never cleared up I started my period after day of medicine and after that I was back to square one It did not work at all for any of the symptoms except the smell of the discharge was less bad so thats why I gave it a two instead of a one Still trying to find a medicine that helps me This is so frustrating
1090,Metronidazole,Rosacea,10,39814,66,I have found that MetroGel clears up the pustule like eruptions within hours
1091,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,39683,44,Worked great and very fast No side effects experienced
1092,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,41935,28,Ive been using it for about weeks After the first few days I noticed a considerable difference in the size of my pores I tend to have oily skin and as a bonus this medication seems to decrease oil production I will keep using it
1093,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,41871,53,I had flushing rosacea for years before it was diagnosed Then I spent years trying one medication after another to control it but due to side effects could not take them About years ago I was prescribed MetroGel It has changed my life The persistent flushing and burning are almost completely gone I still wear sunscreen and a hat when outside but now I can read at night and watch TV with the lights on
1095,Metronidazole,Rosacea,7,41790,46,Well there isnt a cure but this sure helps
1098,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,8,41428,42,I had bacterial vaginitis It was very unpleasant as one would expect My Dr prescribed Metrogel and Diflucan Did the gel for three nights About two weeks later itch occurred so I took the Diflucan Ive had bacterial vaginitis twice and subsequently a yeast infection Metrogel diflucan combo worked great for meGave an because I got a yeast infection after the bacterial vaginitis treatment but Diflucan cleared it up
1099,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,41346,49,Since MetroGel I no longer smell
1100,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,41201,74,I have found Metrocream to be very effective in combating symptoms of rosacea especially the pimple like lesions I get around my nose amp chin area I use only when needed and notice after just a couple of applications a dramatic improvement
1104,Metronidazole,Rosacea,9,40816,61,Great working only if you use nonstopand start to work only after weeks therapy
1105,Metronidazole,Rosacea,2,40554,33,This medicine worked for about two weeks and then stopped
1107,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,40529,36,Have used this medication for months and found it to be ineffective in controlling the rosacea I continued to use it only at the urging of my physician applying it three times daily with NO symptomatic relief
1108,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,40484,59,When I use Metrogel I dont have to worry about bacterial vaginitis coming back easily It helps faster and its very effective When I take the oral medicines bacterial vaginitis recurs within weeks That can be a major pain The only bummer is the yeast infection that can sometimes occur
1109,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,10,40316,53,I love this medicine cor bacterial vaginitis It works well and I never have side effects However I almost always get a yeast infection afterwards so I have my doctor prescribe Diflucan as well
1110,Metronidazole,Rosacea,1,40245,76,After weeks of using it my face is redder bumpier itchy and sore
1111,Metronidazole,Rosacea,8,40205,49,This medication has been very effective in controlling my rosacea symptoms Since it has a cream base it helps with my dry skin as well
1113,Metronidazole,Perioral Dermatitis,8,40181,15,Works pretty well for my perioral dermatitis but I should have seen a doctor sooner Its been resistant to the medicine but is slowly healing Definitely have the metallic taste in my mouth from it and a bit of intestinal discomfort
1115,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,9,39966,81,Metrogel is a very good solution to curing a vaginal infection A common side effect not listed is heavy discharge I have also experienced pelvic cramping from day but about the same as menstrual cramps
1116,Metronidazole,Rosacea,6,39832,36,Useful for rosacea that is not extremely out of control If you have just a few pustules it can be helpful when used regularly
1118,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,43071,0,I tried it today cause Irsquove been getting really bad migraines and I tried it expecting it to work but instead I got bad side effects neck is tighten and I also have a severe migraine really disappointed and going to speak to my doctor about finding me something else never taking it again
1120,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,43042,0,This is the only Rx that will get rid of my migraines thus far but it has painful side effects I stumbled across the antioxidant drink called BAIacute Justin Timberlake and Christopher Walken do a commercial for it and it literally takes away the side effects so Im not in pain or knocked our for the hours it takes to get through my system You take the pill with the Baiacute and slowly sip on it As soon as you feel an ache take another drink I have no idea why it works but it does
1121,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,43035,0,This review is for the injectable form of Imitrex sumatriptan only For anyone that has tried the pill or nasal spray forms and found them ineffective please try the injections They work wonders and act fast Ive tried the other types and they actually seemed to make me more nauseous and especially the nasal spray I keep one in my purse at all times so that I can get relief anytime a migraine hits The pain is not bad as the needle is very small and thin You dont have to jab yourself just press against your skin and push a button The pain of migraine is much worse Ive found the most comfortable injection site to be the bit of fat at the top of my buttox I use the mg injections but Im pretty sure there is also a lower dose
1122,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,43025,2,Had a allergic reaction to this medication and it was one of the scariest moments of my life
1123,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42995,3,I was suffering bad migraines for days until I came across this medicine which works wonders
1124,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42994,4,I am perimenopausal age and for last several years suffered from debilitating migraines I days wasted because I was too sick from these headaches Forget Excedrin for migraines or any other OTC drugs no relief whatsoeverThis past weekend I had a migraine that pretty much knocked me out the pain was horrific nausea vomiting and cried like a babyFinally went to emergency room and they gave me Imitrex Within minutes headache was gone I was very sleepy but I dont know if thats a side effect or just from not sleeping the prior days
1125,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42985,7,Reading some of these reviews makes me wonder how much of a chance they gave the medication Ive had vascular migraines since I was Im today I take Excedrin migraine for my headaches I take Imitrex for my migraines Used to be hard to tell the difference I understand now the difference But before I found Imitrex I took all kinds of prevention meds Amitriptyline nortriptyline Zoloft more than I can remember Never prevented a darn thing Just ended up with side effects from those As a teen that meant acne and weight gain Aka hell Its been years now since Ive found Imitrex And like many I was worried about trying it But there came a day I couldnt NOT try it minutes later I kicked myself for waiting
1126,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42984,5,I have had migraines since my teenage years sumatriptan is the only medication that works every single time with no side effects besides being a little tiered thank goodness for this pill
1127,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42968,5,I am yrs old I started having migraines at age so yrs now About to a week These migraines changed my life completely for the worst Sometimes they were so bad I would have rather died All of a sudden I couldnt work I quit my job at age Spent yrs trying or different medicines and other remedies to get rid of or control my migraines and nothing worked for me until I tried mg sumatriptan To keep my point short mg sumatriptan has been a miracle drug for me I just have to make sure I take it immediately when I feel a migraine coming and take it with food timing is everything with this drug Take too early it wont work and too late then it will take longer to work
1128,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42954,1,Works of the time
1130,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42946,6,Iam years old and I have been suffering from chronic migraine since the age of no medication has worked like Imitrex or sumatropan I take the pill when I have migraine pain and literally it takes about to minutes and WALLA migraine GONE YES THANKS science
1133,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42923,6,I preferred Relpax but my insurance stopped covering it Imitrex works at least of the time but maybe of those times the headache recurs and I have to take another one which almost never happened with Relpax My side effects are weird but not debilitating sense of pressure in head neck chest shoulders arms tingling in face dry burning eyes skin sensitivity to hotcold taste sensitivity to spicysour lack of appetite sweat thirst diuretic A bit sluggish and sometimes drowsy but not truly fatigued Almost never nauseous never dizzy A couple of hours later I often feel mild muscle soreness The side effects are stronger if I take it on an empty stomach but it also works faster
1134,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42915,1,I was having my followup appointment with my neurologist and she gave me a sample of this because the oral tablets were not working and the nasal solution was taking a while to work for me This was my miracle drug for me one evening I felt my migraine coming on and I tried my sample pack I was very nervous about blowing something up my nostril but this wasnt bad at all and within minutes I could feel my headache start to calm down I did not have to go into my dark room I am really impressed and you dont taste the medication going down your throat as much as you do with the solution Thank you
1135,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42912,11,Ive been experiencing migraines for about years now The pain is always on one side of my head and is completely debilitating I used to have to take a bunch of Ibuprofen and sleep in a cool dark room until it went away which took forever Finally I was introduced to this medicine I took it a few hours into my migraine and the pain was gone within minutes The medicine made me feel a little weird like my senses were overly receptive and my skin was a bit tingly These temporary symptoms are NOTHING compared to the migraine Ive learned to like these odd side effects because thats how I know my migraine is leaving This is a miracle drug and over the past year Ive been taking it its never failed to relieve the pain
1136,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42910,3,After suffering with cluster headaches for two years I was prescribed sumatriptan mg tablets which were effective if taken on an empty stomach They got to work in about min which saved a good hour or so of debilitating pain so were great When the next bout hit I asked about the injections as the tablets didnt always workwork quick enough Doctor agreed and I got Imigran mg Wow Just wow Aborts the headache within a couple of minutes of injection which is simple and easy They are a lifesaver and I would recommend anybody who suffers cluster headaches to ask your doctor about it In the UK theyre available on NHS my doctor was hesitant at first as apparently they cost pound per injection pack But they are worth it
1137,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42899,4,Started having debilitating not able to take my head from under the pillow and nauseavomiting migraines after having my daughter I get about a month most of them are menstrual migraines but I was lucky to find imitrex soon after I started having migraines I used to take injectable or nasal spray but have been on mg tabs for a few years now Nothing else but Imetrex works and it works for me every time I am not a fan of the side effects at all which are muscle tension mostly in jaw and neck as well as feeling drained for several hours after I will take it over the horrible migraines any day though
1139,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42891,0,Fabulous medication after getting to the point I was taking mg ibuprofen way too many a day and at least paracetamol and not even getting relief this came as a god send Worked wonderfully
1140,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42880,0,This was hugely helpful for me when my doctor figured out that I was suffering from migraines Once in a while I get sick to my stomach before the medication takes effect especially if Ive delayed taking it for whatever reason but I cant describe how much better it is to have this than to suffer If I lose a dose to emesis Ill take another with a small amount of water and wait for everything to calm down Keeps me functional where before Id have been wiped out and wishing for death for a day or more Side effects for me have been very mild and occasional Slight tingly feelings or a little bit of mental quotdistancequot from my surroundings Words cant describe how much better this is than torture
1141,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42877,4,Lifesaver This med has helped give me my life back I occasionally had days of lights off ice pack cool amp quiet bedroom time for the pain often to the point of vomiting Ive been on it for years and take the injections with warm amp tingly side effects but completely worth it I crash for an hour with an ice pack amp when I get up I feel fantastic Love ❤
1142,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,42874,0,My experience with generic imitrex has been bad It sometimes works sort of but a day or so after I have debilitating muscle aches It took me a while to make the association but once I switched back to the real medication that problem went away
1144,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,42865,0,Just tried sumatriptan for the first time I got it over the counter in a UK chemist Im a yr old man who has suffered from debilitating migraines since a teenager They have become less frequent with age but when I get the early signs aurora it still sends me into panic of whats to come lying helplessly in Hell for hours so when I heard of a new effective drug I jumped at the chance and this was my experience you get two pills I took one with water and laid down in a dark room after about mins I could feel the drug starting to take effect it was if the migraine was still happening but it had been dulled down or masked by the drug you feel tired sick and a bit bit weird but its better than the migraine pain
1146,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42854,5,I only used this one time it did not work for me and made me feel worse I hate that I have unused ones that are going to go to waste
1147,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42850,8,I have been using Imitrex mg injections for several years as an emergency migraine abortive While it did instantly relieve the head pain and nausea I had to then wait out minutes of side effects Those side effects were upper jaw pain and overall body aches like when you have the flu such as super sensitive skin even my hair hurt But for a long time this was the only option available to me through insurance and the side effects were more bearable than the migraine But recently the injection stopped working and I ended up having to go to the ER Now I have been given Zomig nasal spray I have not had a reason to try it yet but am worried about side effects
1149,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,42837,9,I avoid taking Imitrex if I can because I experience so many side effects from it I get jaw and shoulder painstiffness pain in the back of my neck and scalp headaches drowsiness and I just generally feel weird and awful after taking it After hours or so my migraine goes away and the awfulness of the Imitrex lessens so that is why I do take it occasionally Every time I take it Im reminded of how badly I need to find something else
1150,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,42836,2,Im and my doctor prescribed me this because I suffer from constant headachesmigraines This has the worst side effects which made my body ache it hurt when I yawned and I felt so much pressure on my chest My head was still pounding hours after taking it I wont be taking these again
1152,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,42815,3,Just took it for the first time today use to use Maxalt This drug completely knocked me out so sleepy and tired not to mention feeling very weird Its been hours and I feel not great Headache gone but left with fatigue and dizziness Back to maxalt
1153,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42811,0,The medication was amazing I loved how quickly it worked for my migraines I get too many a month to use Zecuity exclusively so I saved it for the bad nausea ones Unfortunately the second time I used it the patch burned a hole in my leg When I called to report it the company insisted it was just an allergic reaction I literally had a chunk of skin missing and I still have a scar several months later The medication is great but whatever they use to push it through the skin is not good Obviously since it has since been recalled Disposal of all of the materials is ridiculous I would have driven an hour or two to the nearest speciality pharmacy to not have to deal with the delivery and packaging of the medication
1154,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42810,2,Finally something nonaddictive that actually treats my migrainesI take this with an aleve and I usually get relief within an hour and the relief lasts a few hours about Only downside is that it makes you really drowsy and it makes you feel like quotblahquot for a few days after you take it but its totally worth it in my opinionAlso I feel safe taking it since its the only option my doctor had that doesnt have any warning about possible addiction
1156,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42804,4,Ive been getting migraines for years and every doctor kind of wrote it off as hormones or stress and just told me to relax and take advil They would last a couple days I couldnt get out of bed the whole time Just constant pounding in my neck eye teeth and forehead Last month I finally talked an neurologist into seeing me without a referral and he couldnt believe my other doctors and let it go on so long and not sent me to him He gave me the generic imitrex and said to take it with the antinausea med promethazineI had to use it for the first time yesterday It was amazing In mins I could tell it was going away I felt a little foggy for an hour or so and my reaction time was decreased for a few hours but Ill take it
1157,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42785,11,Works great the only one for me no side effects yrs old started getting these headaches last yr Excedrin Aspirin Fiercet and Advil didnt work takes about an hour to kick in but since nothing else works I can wait it out
1158,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42775,14,I have suffered migraines and headaches since I was little Iam years old and in physical healthy shape I as many I have been a prisoner in my own body Iam totally debilitated for what use to be hours at a time has grown to sometimes days I have suffered hearing loss ringing in my ears with the fullness and so many other symptoms from sinus pressure to neck pain etc I have at different times had epidural shots in my neck for migraines and tried all kinds of pain killers and daily meds to lower the severity and frequency they occur Last month alone I had headaches which were migraines UGH The Dr put me on Imitrex to try I was nervous but it is a miracle drug for me
1159,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,8,42775,5,Ive had cluster headaches for about years now and havent found any helpful meds until now Sumatriptan has been extremely helpful for me this cluster period I use the tablets so it takes about minutes to feel the effects I take it as soon as I start to feel tension in the head and neck with the slight onset of a headache By the time it starts to work the attack is almost in full force but once it kicks in the pain immediately subsides and begins to quickly go away It saves me at least a good hour of the intense tortuous pain which also saves me a lot of the side effects of the attacks such as nausea and fatigue Ive found little to no side effects along with the drug so Im almost immediately able to function afterwards
1160,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42763,4,Went to see my neurologist for usual migraine check up med refills treatment While there he suggested Botox another story DO NOT DO IT I am in horrible non stop pain since I was in the middle of an episode I got a Toradol injection and this NEW Onzetra Nasal Not a fan of anything going up my nose should have went with my gut instinct You put one opening in a nostril the other in your mouth and blow Like blowing up balloon blowing powder through out your nose soft palette and throat It felt like sucking salt water up your nose the pain was immediate eye watering dizzying nose pinching nauseous pain I coughed gagged cried wanted to scream days later am worse than ever pain shaking incapacitated Not worth it
1161,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42759,7,I have migraines that are usually triggered by hormonal changes around my menstrual cycle I have been taking this medication for roughly years now My migraines become so bad I shake vomit and otherwise feel like I am dying Sumatriptan has been a godsend for me I take the pill form and mg is all I usually need It takes around minutes to an hour to kick in were I feel I can function again and I feel completely normal by hours I request Dr Ready brand I have had some brands not work as well Hence the rating of for me due to inconsistent effectiveness with generic brands It does make me a little lightheaded and whole body fatigued for the first hour but that is nothing compared to suffering through a migraine
1162,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,1,42745,2,Ive been having chronic headaches for the past month to the point where they get severe not a migraine so I asked my dr for Sumatripan and she gave me it little did I know it doesnt get rid of the headache nor relieve it Im on day of it and all its done is make me dizzy my chest feel heavy and horrible that I cant breathe and need to cough hard my shoulders feel heavy and achein my neck and its made my headache feel like a full blown migraine which I havent felt for years never having it again I dont recommend this medication its made me feel really horrible
1164,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42739,3,I have read many of the other reviews of Sumavel DosePro and agree that I have had some not fire when I go to inject myself I have learned to be patient and continue to hold the applicator in place and continually push it into my skin until the injector fires It sometimes takes a while but it does eventually goes off You just need to be patient Yes its frustrating but when you have a migraine its worth the wait This has been a miracle drug for me and I will continue to use it as long as it is available to me
1165,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42739,4,I been suffering with Cluster Headaches for over years I just used the injected form of Sumatripan The pain was completely gone in mins Amazing
1166,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42738,4,I have suffered from chronic migraine headaches since I was I have at least a month Ive tried everything had MRIs done gone to several specialist and none could help me Eventually I was put on Sumatriptain which is used to stop the migraine in its track I am prescribed a month and almost always I use all This medicine has saved my life because after minutes my migraine is completely gone
1167,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,42601,5,Very bad experiencereaction with only half a dose Did not take away headache Increase in pain heavy weight feeling on my chest shortness of breath cold sweats This med was a nightmare for me I felt immediate pain and pressure in head neck and shoulders The worst however was feeling like a one hundred pound weight on my chest Additionally nausea and cold sweats and feeling like I was in big trouble practically and ER trip Beware of this med it may not be for everyone Will go back to advil and a coke or my fiorocet Cure is worse than the disease in this case for me
1168,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42595,7,I have had migraines for as long as I could remember especially when its bright loud noises or when Im on my phone I had a really bad migraine and I took a tablet as directed and I felt horrible after So bad it brought me to tears The migraine worsened and I felt nauseous and sick Never will take again
1170,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42593,5,I have a serious issue with Migraines Almost a week When the device was first prescribed back in I did not have a problem since they were coming from San Diego from Telegenics Once ENDO started producing the product all I have are failures I have had as many as of in a box fail to work I have had several that after I tried to use them they spontaneously quotwent offquot on the bathroom counter Luckily not in my face I have contacted ENDO at this point now early August I have not received even replacement for the that failed You know the cost My insurance will stop paying for them in a couple of monthsI reported every one to Endo But the issue is getting worse I have reported this chronic issue to the FDA
1171,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42591,1,Absolutely amazing Never found anything that could take away a migraine until my doctor prescribed this My migraines are gone within minutes of the shot Ive suffered with them since a child and now at I found something that really works This medication is a blessing to me
1173,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42580,4,severe migraines for years took Imitrex shots Immediate and I mean immediate relief Needle is very tiny and you put it up to the side of your thigh Highly recommend
1174,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42565,0,Id taken Excedrin for years wsome effectiveness amp then had a streak where headaches would return within a day and sought medical attention An urgent care doctor prescribed BubalbitalAPAPCaffeine and I used it as needed for about a year and was happy with the results but the prescription was running out Because the medication was prescribed by an urgent care doctor the prescription couldnt be refilled so I had to see an internal medicine doctor and he prescribed Sumatriptan After taking the medicine today it did eventually take away my visual auras and it seems to block the full on migraine but I feel kind of crummy with sinus drainage and pressure grogginess and slight nausea Going to try wpain reliever Naproxen
1175,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42562,8,It works well when you can get to inject This prescription with out insurance is over I have had numerous instances where it did not inject I have out of in my last prescription that failed I just got satisfaction on a failed injector from January I now take the same prescription and it only is a co pay where Suma Vel is amp co pay Robbery and the Endo pharmasuticals shood be ashamed
1176,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,42551,14,Words cannot express how grateful I am for this medicine I have dealt with these crippling headaches since my mid s Now in my mids I finally happened upon a physician at a CareNow of all places who actually listened to me as I told him of the nightmare I face at least three times a day every day for months on end and prescribed Imitrex for me If taken at the very first sign of an attack these little beauties I take the oral can save you minutes to several hours of unimaginable pain I cannot recommend enough that my fellow cluster headache sufferers ask their doctor about considering Imitrex While theres no cure this is the closest thing Ive found so far that at least makes living with these headaches bearable
1178,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42543,6,I am and had been having migraines severe enough to cause vomiting for about years without knowing what they were Was diagnosed a few months ago and given Sumatriptan It has changed my life No side effects at all I take to pill when early signs appear and some naproxen Within hour or so I am fine and life goes on
1179,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42543,5,I am For about years I have had occasional episodes of acute headaches to the point of vomiting Finally got diagnosed with migraine about months ago for some reason it never crossed my mind despite a family history of it Was prescribed sumatriptan Now when I feel a migraine coming on I take or pill along with naproxen Headache is gone within hour My life has greatly improved No side effects at all
1182,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42531,2,The medication itself works which is the only positive thing I can say This quotneedlelessquot injection is so much more painful than any needle Ive ever experienced Ill be going back to real injections My leg is still throbbing in pain minutes later and it took over minutes to stop the bleeding Ive never had pain or bleeding with an Imitrex shot through a hypodermic needle Who would choose this
1183,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42525,3,Imitrex has been a life saver for me As soon as I feel the headache coming I can take half of a mg imitrex and in min the headache subsides I have absolutely no side effects from this medication
1184,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42522,8,My Migraine headache started when I was or years old Now I am years old I have migraine headache about once a week unless when I am on vacation Usually I have them on Monday afternoons because its the first day of the work and I think my eyes get tired or maybe I have more stress But I can get Migraine for the number of reasons Last night for first time I used Imitrex I had awful feelings I cannot describe them but after couple hours my migraine was gone I got very sleepy but it felt very good The best part is that the next day I had no headache either Because my headaches usually takes days to go away I hope that it works next week as well
1186,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42489,9,I was diagnosed with severe painful and silent migraines a few months ago but the neurologist said Ive most likely suffered from silent migraines my entire life Im by the way but recently they have started getting painful Imitrex was the first medication I was put on I was excited to start feeling better but imitrex made me feel awful I suffer from extreme nausea before during and after a migraine and its completely life ruining Ive tried imitrex many times in hopes of it finally working Every time Id take it Id get a horrible burning in my throat and my migraine would worsen It didnt help nausea aura pain or any other migraine symptoms I suffer from Ive recently been put on another medication thatll hopefully work
1187,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42488,7,I have had migraine for years and been on every migraine medicine I am diagnosed as chronic with or more migraine days a month My doctor is very progressive with new treatments and offered zecuity because it is considered to be very clean as far as triptan side effects and no hangover or fog I was properly trained on how to use the medicine with insuring a good seal since it is a patch and forewarned that it can be uncomfortable the first or minutes I put it on ensuring a good seal Activated the red LED button It was prickly for about minutes Annoying but not painful My migraine was completely gone in minutes I had redness at the active site of delivery but it went away in a few days No other side effects
1189,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,42469,1,I first experienced cluster headaches at age in the spring several times a day for about a month just suffered through with OTC pain meds which did nothing Finally got to see a neurologist in my s who was awesome diagnosed as classic cluster headache got on verapamil prophilaxis mg xday which I take when quotshadowsquot start coming also oxygen Lmin for aborting attack This has been working but if start oxygen too late then attack progresses I tried sumatriptan injection for the first time when oxygen failed and attack was in full swing tried sumatryptan injection mg scamazing all symptoms were gone within minutes I will keep trying the oxygen but will definitely use sumatryptan as backup
1190,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42464,8,I dont like it at all Have taken times and causes me to yawn alot and jaw tightness Makes me feel really weird
1191,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,42461,3,Well I was having really bad cluster headaches I took an imitrex for the first time With in mins I was projectile vomiting and having bad stomach cramps The taste stayed in my mouth for hours My headache has went down some but it was still there
1192,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42725,12,I have suffered migraines maybe times a year or so since I was little Usually accompanied by vomiting and complete inability to function The past two years after having my second daughter the migraines have amped up to or a month sometimes more Imitrex works almost always to eliminate the migraine Every once in awhile I wait too long and have to take two I have no side effects to speak of which is crazy to me because I cant even use herbal remedies without experiencing weird side effects Im thankful for the scientists who created this drug I always have it with me just in case and it keeps me from being out for the count with my two little girls
1193,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42717,8,Will not ever touch it again I suffer migraines so bad that I end up in the hospital almost on a regular basis Well my doctor finally prescribed imitrex and I swore up and down that I wouldnt take it due to potential side effects but my head hurt so bad today that I threw in the towel and took one Mind you Im on the mg and it has done nothing but ignore my migraine causing it to manifest into a bigger one
1195,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,42712,0,Took this as given by doctor for migraines I was having daily well never again will I take this tablet Made me feel so unwell I cant describe how I felt Never again
1198,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42703,3,Ive been suffering with migraine for years Tried everything on the market including acupuncture Used imitrex needle injections for many years Learned about sumavel dosepro a few years ago Loved this script Very good success with it However in the past few months I have had injections not fire off or minutes after my attempts the cartridges fired off on my counter Some never fired off and the medicine remained in the injector I contacted Endo and they were helpful Took the information and sent a postage paid envelope to return the defective injections to some lab in California Endo forwarded info to my insurance company for replacements Surprise Im still waiting for these replacements Getting nowhere
1199,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42699,12,This med works well for me in about mins My comment involves the packaging When you are struggling with a bad headache it is extremely stressful trying to open the plastic and foil the pill is sealed in Dont always have scissors at handyAny one else find this annoying Should be changed
1201,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42692,4,Ive been suffering really bad migraines for the last r wks At first i bought over the counter tabs like anadin extra paracetamol ect Altho these meds worked eventualy i would still go between mins in excruciating pain then id get a few hours of relief then it would start al over again it was very exhaustin an so painful Eventualy I went to the doc he prescrided naproxen these tablets didnt even touch the pain after a few days I resorted back to over the counter meds Then I went back to the doctor he prescrided sumatripton tabs yesterday I took my first tab early this morn when I felt the pain The relief was amazing It took the edge of the pain strait away and was barable less than mins the pain was gone Best relief ever
1202,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42691,4,I get migraines mostly when wake up and weather changes Works within minutes A real miracle
1203,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42674,11,I have suffered from migraine for many years Before I started using Imitrex about years ago some migraines would affect me for days I missed out on so much back then Imitrex changed that I normally can take one dose and get complete relief in an hour The only side effect that I have ever suffered is sleepiness but its not so severe that I cant take Imitrex while working if a migraine strikes This medication has been a life saver for me and changed my quality of life
1205,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42656,3,Been experiencing migrainesheadaches since I could remember Im unable to take Nsaids so meds such as Cambia are not an option for me which helped but not as well Daily medications such as Topamax were not effective enough to warrant the extreme fatigue Finally after requesting an quotas neededquot dosing med a doctor prescribed this one Took dose shortly after symptoms began oral tab Took roughly an hour to take effect but it really helped I had option for nd dose but felt enough relief to get through evening Had some side effects but they were tolerable and did not worry me since I read what to expect ahead of time Side effects short lived comared to constant fatigue of alternatives and worth the relief I received
1206,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42652,0,Given this drug to my mother after an hour taking mg she admitted to relieve in her migraine but weakness whole day long but after two days symptoms reappeared so now giving her tricyclic antidepressant mg at bed time only for a month now she feels better
1207,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42635,7,I have had diagnosed migraines for about years have tried many different doctors and medications I just couldnt believe a pain horrible enough to cause vomiting amp wanting to stop living was randomly daignosed as quotmigrainequot No known cause or cure Headaches put me down for two solid days and were sometimes twice per week No life I was prescribed Sumatriptan mg tablets amp OMG miraculous Take one at the onset of headache amp its gone in around minutes Tightness in shouldes chest quickly passes My life has been changed by this medication I am so thankful I have no other side affects alert amp able to go about my lifejob YAAAYYYY
1210,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,42628,0,Relieved migraine and reduced temperature in minutes first time has never taken longer than mins to act Quite impressed with this worked when codeine and others failed
1211,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42624,5,I love this medicine when it works Recently Ive had a problem with it failing to inject I will press it on my leg and nothing happens Ive reported the problem to ENDO and never heard back I also reported the problem to CVS In both cases I turned over the nonworking needle less shots I really depend on this medicine when I have migraines because it works like a charm but i find the injections to be unreliable
1212,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42622,1,I have been a long time sufferer of migraines for years on my life and I am so half of my life I have been on many many daily meds and meds to take to help with the pain to heavy narcotics This is the ONLY inject able that helps with my migraines I try my normal thing of IB Profin and a benadryl and if that does not work after a few hours I use Sumavel DosePro and with in minutes of the time I am migraine free and ready to go though my day This works for onsets to walking up with a full blown migraine
1213,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42619,10,Imitrex works wellto rid me of my migraines a few hours after I have taken it but the side effects for me are pretty bad It makes me feel really weird and it seems like my whole body is achy and muscles are burning Of course the side effects that I get from this medicine is nothing compared to a full blown migraine hence why Ive been taking it all these years I will be talking with my doctor at my next visit though about switching medicines because Im sick of feeling like crap after taking it
1215,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,42614,3,I love this medicine I suffer from eye pain then a knot in my back muscle then vision aura and light flashes then here it comes the vice feeling in my right side of my head That knaws at me all day unless I take sumatriptan within minutes Im a new person The only down fall is my doctor wont let me take more than a week period So I suffer in between nothing else works this medicine is s miracle worker
1216,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42612,10,Ive had migraines since age so years I received Imitrex at and am forever grateful I average one migraine every months usually wchanges in weather andor interrupted or reduced sleep If I recognize the aura phase usually smells sometimes halos or light streakstrails and take Imitrex within the first couple of hours it can completely ward off the pain If I dont catch it in the aura and take it after actual pain hits its still helpful but I will still be subject to days pain and need recurring doses plus I supplement Imitrex with naproxen and caffeine But it works Ive gone from being bedbound in a dark silent room to being able to work even wflourescent lights without vomiting or worse Life changing
1217,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42460,5,If you are a migraine sufferer this is a MIRACLE DRUG Yes the quotinjectionquot is sort of painful for like secs and I only experienced a little soreness in the spot afterwards But within mins of the injection my DEBILITATING MIGRAINE WITH NAUSEA AND BLURRED VISION WAS GONE I was able to head to work and put in a full hours as normal No nausea no follow up dosage no pills just a little sleepiness Im a yr old female that suffers from migraines with vomiting light sensitivity blurred vision per month Yes they are expensive but I am lucky enough to have great insurance coverage thru my employer and only pay per mon for of these
1218,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42458,6,I saw the ad for Zecuity in a magazine a month or so ago The whole process to get the patches takes a long time weeks to a month or more I have migraines maybe every other month but they can be severe with vomiting lasting two days not counting the migraine hangover afterwards I usually take narcotics and have Zofran for the nausea but if I wake up with a full blown migraine the meds dont stay down even with the Zofran The patch is complicated to set up but it worked Sunday I had a migraine it didnt work as well and I have a raised red circular welt on my arm that itches like anything I am going to the doctor tomorrow so Ill check it out with him I hope it works better the next time
1220,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,42454,0,I took one Sumatriptan tablet when the migraine aura began I found that it upset my stomach and wasnt as effective for headache pain as Excedrin Migraine
1222,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42439,3,Ive been experiencing migraines ever since I was around or When I went on birth control they started getting a little better except for when I was either really stressed or on my period both times when they are really bad I talked to my doctor about it and she put me on imatrex which I tried for the first time when I was when my sister took it and it works wonders It alleviates the headache in about minutes The thing Ive noticed that is its best when you first start to feel a migraine coming on not when youre migraine is already unbearable Ive also experienced some minor side affects like drowsiness and some minor stomach pains usually only if i take it on an empty stomach but other than that Ive had no issue
1223,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42436,1,I started by taking imitrex pills and now am using the nasal spray it works so much quicker But I have the foul taste after taking it
1224,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,42417,1,Made me more sick
1226,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42397,6,Pain would cease within minutes
1227,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42395,3,Straight at onset injected and pain gone within a matter of minutes Where have you been all my life
1228,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42381,8,Im only and I was prescribed it at and told only to take it when my migraines were unbearable Every time I have taken it I usually get a really sick feeling such as hot flashes weakness nausea and dizzy Theres always like a feeling that my brain is being frozen over from where the migraine mostly is But I always take it and go straight to sleep except for last night I stayed up and I was seeing and hearing things that werent there I couldnt do simple tasks I forgot where my room was after my boyfriend told me to drink some water I cried over everything I was scared of everything Staying awake for me was horrifying
1229,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42376,7,I took one pill at onset then took a second pill after hours of no relief as directed I spent a total of hours puking and uncoordinated except for the hour the nd pill knocked me out with drowsiness My migraine never subsided and continued to rage in full force during and after the side effects Will not take again
1230,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,42364,24,I am a long time sufferer of frequent chronic migraines up to a month I have used sumatriptan since it became available both in pill form and selfinjection Yesterday I tried the new patch ldquoZecuityrdquo for the first time and likely the last The actual cost per patch is about The packaging is ridiculous a box overnight delivered which was about two feet square with a weight of about pounds It contained a large thick styrofoam container six special red ldquoPureTemp Bricksrdquo designed to keep the drug at room temperature it must be kept between it degrees FahrenheitndashNOT refrigerated and a box of four patches The patches themselves contain the medication but also the ldquoreleasedeliveryrdquo system which includes a computer chip the red light to indicate activation and completion of medication delivery four hoursndashthen the light turns off and patch can be removed and two lithiummanganese dioxide batteries perchlorate material which are considered TOXIC WASTE by the federal government and cannot be thrown away in the regular trash Instructions say to contact your local authorities to inquire how to properly and legally dispose of the used patches The above in and of itself should give most people pause as to whether this is all worth it But as anyone who is suffering from a migraine will tell you the pain and other symptoms are so bad you feel like yoursquod try practically anything So hey even though this is the same drug maybe this fancy delivery system is the magic relief we have been searching for Personally sumatriptan lessons the duration and severity of my migraines but has never ldquorelievedrsquo them It may for some but not for me Other than the powerful narcotics I take for other chronic pain itrsquos the only other thing that helps at all Of course there are strict limits on the number of times it can be used per month for safety reasons so I can only use it for my worst migraines The limit on the patches no more than four per month So okay I decide to give them a try I followed all of the somewhat detailed and involved instructions and ldquoactivate itrdquo apply it and push the ldquostartrdquo button and the little red light comes on Within a few minutes I start to feel a tingling itchy burning sensation though not too bad and certainly not unbearable or even anything as bad as the pain of the migraine Within about five minutes the gel I assume the medication starts to ooze out the sides of the patch making a sticky mess and of course causing the adhesive of the patch to stop working and the thing starts to practically fall off Okay the directions say if there are problems with the patch staying in place to use medical tape So I use medical tape All around the entire patch I use medical tape Five minutes later even the medical tape starts to come loose due to the ozzing gel so I apply even more tape a lot of tape I am also concerned that there is more medicine sticking to the tape than being absorbed into my body I also only feel very slightly any effect of the sumatriptan I felt a mild burning sensation the entire time the patch was on as well as red irritated itchy rashy skin upon removal Oh yeah and now what the heck do I do with this environmentally hazardous medical waste Are most users really going to properly dispose of these things As far a headache relief obviously intramuscular injection is a quicker way of getting this drug into your body to provide whatever amount of relief you are going to get from it as quickly as possible Another consideration my health insurance required Prior Approval to cover the patches part of which was a statement from me and my doctor that the other forms of ingestion of sumatriptan pill selfinjection intranasal spray were inadequate and that I required the patches When I found that out I refused and told my doctor to do the same I had little faith that a hour patch of the same drug would work better than a second injection and I did not want to give up my ability to keep receiving the injections The drug company provided the one month free trial four patches so I agreed to try them Several years ago I remember how happy I was when Imetrix finally went generic and I was able to obtain sumatriptan much cheaper It saved me and my insurance company a lot of money I donrsquot really want to give that up either So I suppose that there are people who may find these patches amazing and effective especially those who for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to use the selfinjections For me however considering all of the factors above I think Irsquoll stick with the injectable pun intended and sometimes the pills as I donrsquot like to carry the autoinjections around in my purse I already have to carry an epipen with mehellip I wish the best to other migraine sufferers perhaps the patches will give them the relief they seek For me however they are not the answer
1231,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42360,16,I have been suffering from migraines since around and now at although they have became less frequent over the years They are horrible as I usually am out for the entire day bedridden in a dark room I have always been very paranoid to try a actual migraine medicine so have taken vicodin for the pain I recently had a migraine at work and decided to try a imitrex my doctor prescribed me I was nervous to try it but am so happy I did I waited a few minutes of having the migraine before I took it but it relieved me of my migraine within minutes I did experience some effects like muscle stiffness in my neck tightness in my face and a burning feeling in my nose and forehead for about a hour but Ill take that any day over a migraine
1232,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42349,9,Helpless migraine victim for years My Dr Recommended imitrex so I took it I took one mg it tasted horrible I had an upset stomach for almost hours I did get a heartburn feeling in my chest hotflash mood swings but my Migraine disappeared I will speak to my neurologist regarding my side effects I would consider using imitrex again in the future
1233,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42337,6,Ive used sumatriptan for about years to treat my migraines that Ive had since I was Theyre mostly period and stress related headaches Nothing had ever helped and Im excited that I can finally get on with my life without laying bed for days suffering in pain It works pretty quickly or minutes after I take the medication Its a life saverIt does make my extremities tingly and sensitive to heat and cold But overall Im thankful to have an option
1236,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42322,3,Had clusters years now Ive tried literally EVERYTHING out there The only thing that works for immediate relief is imitrex injections If med takes too long nasal or pill it simply doesnt work Gabapentin sp regime should be started immediately they eventually stop the nerve from spasms Imitrex is now available generic sumatriptan however still expensive I pay shot only available as a twopack
1237,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42316,2,This RX did not work for me My migraine went from a pain level to a after I took it
1238,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,42314,7,After years of taking this medicine it has lead up to hair thinning out severely full body muscle pain and weakness as a side effect and a possible stroke It works to get rid of the migraine but this what happens when you take it long term
1239,Sumatriptan,Migraine,4,42313,4,I have been suffering from migraines for over years My migraines are hormonal but also stress related First time I took sumatriptan I couldnt believe how effective it was My migraine disappeared in only minutes and I was able to live my life as a quotnormalquot person instead of lying on bed all day Unfortunately the magic only lasted a few times I realised every time I had a migraine it took longer and longer for the drug to act And also my migraines were more frequent since I began using sumatriptan I stopped taking this triptan and my doctor suggested another one zolmitriptan which is working really well for me and I only have migraine per month now
1240,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42296,4,I swear Sumatriptan injections saved my life My new best friend I never leave home without them
1241,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42296,5,Sumatriptan is a life changer Ive suffered from cluster headaches for years having one at least once a week and NOTHING has ever come close to helping Now I havent had one in months I take a pill when I feel a cluster headache coming which successfully aborts it Even hours into a full blown attack I took a pill and relieved of the pain Another great thing My insurance covers it Even better it is only for pills you can break them in half and have without insurance
1242,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42089,1,I have been a cluster headache suffer for yearsMy Dad suffers as wellI remember him sitting in a chair day after day night after night with no real relief I never could understand or know how intense the attacks were until I started with minelucky my dad was prescribed Imitrex in the s at the beginning of mine his words and mine are that this drug is a god send for us suffersMy issue is now my insurance company will only approve boxes of shots per month So my only way is to stock pile these boxes every month until my next attackwell Im out and now I wiil use coupons or any other way to purchase these on my own to try to save Sad UHC will not approve the number of shots needed for each episode
1243,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42075,5,I can make the injections last by using only a vial per cluster attack I take the vial out of the auto injector and use a qtip to press in the amount After this I wait exactly minutes and the headache is gone I had a very hard time getting enough injections from my insurance to cover all the cluster headaches I was getting and this method helped me handle x more than I could before I do feel my headache pain jumping from a gt immediately after injection Taking the mg tablets does not cause this increase in pain but the wait is about mins for relief Sometimes I can tell which headaches to use either the injection or pill for
1244,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42060,15,I have suffered from migraines for many years but menopause has made the headaches both more intense and frequent The only medication that helps is Sumatriptan Typically the headache is gone within minutes although it usually gets a little worse before it gets better There are side effects most notably jaw pain difficulty swallowing and a quotspaceyquot feeling but honestly these are minor compared with the agony of a migraine I love this medication and do not know how I would manage without it
1246,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42044,2,I was recently prescribed Imigran the European version of Imitrex for Acute Cluster Headache in the injection form pretty much life changing Id previously tried Oral Sumatriptan for Cluster Headaches but that just did not seem effective and once a full blown attack had started the pill did not seem to abort the headache Injectable Sumatriptan though has proved to be a totally different thing and even when the pain is at its peak once injected its probably minutes maximum before the headache is gone totally gone Ive suffered from Cluster Headaches for many years and only wish Id tried this sooner for me it has been just brilliant Having used it several times now have not had any side effects whatsoever fantastic
1247,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10,42040,6,Ive suffered from cyclic vomiting for over years and the only thing that brings me reliefIve suffered for over a week before with the intense vomiting and dibilitating migraines and had to be hospitalized due to dehydration and pain and panic attacksMy GP actually prescribed me the injectable form and at the first sign I take an injection then usually wait minutes and give myself a second injection and this medication has saved my life
1248,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42028,19,Thank you SCIENCE for this medication My migraines used to immobilize me and now I finally have relief thanks to this med Better living through modern science
1249,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42024,18,I have had debilitating migraines since I was a very young child diagnosed at first week of Primary school My childhood is filled with memories of regular migraines and nothing would touch them I started taking Sumatriptan in and my life changed dramatically for the betterIf taken at the first sign of a migraine it works brilliantly I have taken regularly for years usually tabs per week depending on frequency of migraine I am wondering if anyone else has taken longterm and wonder if any other side effects occur
1250,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42022,19,Works well for my migraines First couple of times taking it caused my jaw to feel tight and makes me pretty sleepy
1251,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42020,4,Ive had migraines as young as years old It was horrible every time I got one I was too young to understand that it was a migraine At last when I was years old I began reading more about migraines and knew that I had them The first time ever taking Sumatriptan succinate I felt so relieved and almost migraine free Sometimes I feel tenderness in my jaw and neck but after mins I feel great
1254,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41964,10,After three solid weeks with vestibular migraine tinnitis nausea and no sleep I have finally found what works Mild dizziness especially when bending tinnitis is there no dopey feeling and I am finally relaxed I tried EVERYTHING elseTopomax was a disaster B shot heatcold alcohol no alcohol diet sleep Toradol Benedryl shot Phenergan only way to sleep and not be sick Thank goodness too bad I have no insurance and it costs A FORTUNE
1256,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,1,41948,6,Havent seen many people with my experience so I appreciate Housewifeandmothers input below Maybe my problem is also with generic sumatriptan Maybe my dose at mg is too high But out of times after taking it I became horribly nauseous and vomited the pill up within minutes of taking it Im afraid to ever go near it again Still looking for relief from my daily crippling headaches Vicodin and Hydrocodone seem to be the only thing to relieve my pain Started taking magnesium supplements as well but no improvement yet But FYI I think my experience is uncommon
1257,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41946,19,Great Ive taken it twice and didnt experience any major side effects Kicked in after minutes was fully ready to go at minutes after That said I did experience some side effects includingmild heartburnlike feeling during the first hours after taking itmoderate heavinesstightness in my jaw that lasted just about hours after takingsome drowsinesssome mild neck pain which could have been the migrainea tightnesstingling very mild in my forearmsBut Im free and clear of the headache Definitely plan on taking again
1258,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41942,17,Best migraine medicine I have ever used The injection does hurt for a few seconds but the pain is gone as fast as it came Within a few minutes I can feel the medicine rushing through my head It feels very heavy and leaves me with a dizzy sensation I usually need about an hour of sleep and then the migraine is gone completely I suffer about three migraines a week and only need a second dose about once a month Pretty effective if you ask me I have noticed that if I am feeling nauseous already the medicine intensifies this I found that taking a sublingual anti nausea medicine a few minutes before the injection greatly reduces this side effect
1259,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41935,13,Taken at the beginning of symptoms it stops the headache within minutes
1260,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41932,2,Cluster sufferer
1261,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41904,40,My husband has always whats called prostrating attacks which is a form of a migraine that leaves him in so much pain he cant function at all The only medication that has ever worked on him is the Imitrex This stuff is awesome The only thing that is irritating is every time I get his prescription filled the pharmacist try to give him the Sumatriptan the generic version which makes him so sick he will throw up nonstop for hours So I always have to tell them he needs the name brand and I have gotten into many arguments with pharmacists trying to tell me its the same thing ITS NOT When my husband takes Imitrex his migraine is gone within minutes he takes a Sumatriptan and I feel like I need to take him to a hospital
1262,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41896,9,I would NOT have a life without it Ive tried everything Nothing works for me but this Ive been on it years I started out with pen injections then nose spraypill suits me best I dont wish these on anyone Migraines are horrible
1263,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41879,6,Imitrex is truly a miracle for me It has given me my life back
1264,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41871,4,I have had migraines since my late teens I used to take Fiornal but discovered Imitrex which has been a life saver I get migraines with aura followed by pain I use the nasal Imitrex and I find that if I take Imitrex at the onset of my vision loss I am usually able to stop the vision problem as well as stop the migraine within minutes This medication has been a lifesaver for me The only side effect with the nasal spray for me is that it tastes HORRIBLE in the back of my throat and it makes me a bit sickly feeling but all in all Id rather have it than not
1265,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,41855,23,Imitrex did not work for me I have not reached the vomiting stage of a migraine in years thanks to other medications Imitrex did nothing to stop the progression of my migraine I had to leave work in the middle of the afternoon feeling as if I would vomit at my desk in the hallway in the elevator walking to the parking garage the entire way Aleve works better than this stuff and Aleve only keeps nausea at bay but does not cure migraines for me
1266,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41836,16,I have had migraines since my teens and until I was prescribed the Imitrex Injectable I suffered severely I thank GOD for this medicine and cant imagine life without it
1268,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,41822,29,Imitrex in any form is the Best med for Cluster headaches by far High flow oxygen at first twinge and the pill at the onset even if you think it might hurt Most effective You all know how fast they come on Usually work immediately unless late in a cycle I too wish you could take more than twice in a hr period After suffering for almost yrs with no medicine at All For these crippling things I have tried all Imitrex types injections pills nasal sprays Injections are fast but so very expensive and painful as well Nasal spray is nauseating for me the pill form has always worked well if taken at the very BLINK of headache Because of price and insurance restrictions I would wait to take the medicine Not anymore
1269,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,41812,17,I have been using Imitrex since it first came out in the s It was a God send Ive had migraines for years I get about six migraines a month Imitrex always works BUT for me I pay a price with stomach aches Sometimes I refrain from taking Imitrex for fear of the stomach pains
1270,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41802,10,I had a few small reactions but it took care of it and it was gone after some sleep
1272,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41770,6,The injectable version works well for my infrequent every months migraines It stops them dead in their tracks The only downside is it leaves me feeling a little out of as if Id better not operate any heavy machineryI also err by not taking it as soon as the pain hits Thats because I hate jabbing myself with a needle Bizarrely I also get migraines with aura but no pain The aura is only visible in my left eye and looks like fluttering black fringe So weird The first time it happened I was sure I was having a brain bleed When it went away without my dying or having a stroke I figured it was just my brain chemistry throwing a party one with black streamers
1274,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,41737,6,I get migraines with aura Right when I begin to lose my vision I know the migraine is minutes away I take an Imitrex as soon as I start to lose my vision It works within an hour or two about of the time I feel very weak and quotout of itquot when I do take one It still doesnt help with nausea however I have not thrown up from a migraine yet just very nauseousI have also used the injectable version That works SO much better However I have psyched myself out and can no longer give myself a shot for some reasonPhysical Therapy has really helped with my migraines I also quit going to the chiropractor I used to get migraines weekly now its been months and I finally got one today
1275,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41734,6,Have had migraines on and off for years I used Fioricet the last yearswith good results but then my system must have changed that they did not work anymoreAfter talking to an Neurologist and having blood work etc done she putme on Imitrex Sumatriptan mg which worked great Only thing I do is split these into mg pieces and they still work goodFrom reading on different forums I did notice a lot of our fellow migrainesufferers get relief from to mg Also I have not had any side effects taking the mgOnly negative for me is that they are pricey about for pills Whynine who knows but they work and its worth it to me
1276,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41726,28,First month prescription for mg tablets If I take at the first sign of headache goes away about min If wait to take tablet takes up two hours for the pain to stop Since I have daily migraines tried waiting to save tablets concerned run out of mg tablets prior to refill date The Imitrex has been God sent for me I have had migraines since my teens now in my sixities Migranies only health probem I have Plan to call my doctor let know how well Imitrex works for me and see if day prescription or stronger prescription is what I need From other reviews appears some users go days between headaches that would be more than I ever expected after all these years
1277,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41699,9,I have had migraines ever since I can recall my earliest headaches Im lucky that mine progress slowly giving me time to take either ibuprofen or naproxen to take care of the majority of my migraines That said every once in a while I get a acute enough or resistant enough attack that I take Imitex sumatriptan and usually within min my migraines are less severe and within an hour completely resolved I do however have odd side effects If I feel nauseous prior to taking Imitrex it makes my nausea more severe Every time I use sumatriptan my body feels run down and weak almost as if I have taken a muscle relaxer Regardless it is a Godsend when I need it I have mg pills that I cut into quarters I usually only need mg
1278,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41694,43,I come from a family where everyone has terrible migraines When I started getting them at age I resorted to taking loads of Tylenol with Pesudophedrine to quotmaskquot the pain which took a heavy toll on my liver Someone suggested that I look into the Triptan family of migraine medication After going through a few different ones I found Imitrex to be an absolute lifesaver Whenever I feel one coming I take mg and the migraine usually disappears within minutes If I wait a few hours to take it the response time could be more like minutes With migraines a month Imitrex is essentially the only thing that allows me to function I have not seen any real side effects
1279,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41679,9,This pill has completely changed my life I highly recommend it to anyone that suffers from migraines As soon as you feel the symptoms you take it and it goes away in a half hour to an hour and if it doesnt you take another one and it will go away I suffer from migraines and had to be in bed for sometime days This really works for me
1281,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41624,11,Took my husband to doctor while suffering a severe migraine with vomiting which he has suffered from his whole life a month to the point of vomiting After not being able to keep down pills this was his only hope of relief Had first injection at doctors office and within minutes he had relief and was even able to go in to work the same day I am so happy there is something that cures his pain He said the shot hurt but it was worth it The cost is high but also worth it when he is in that much pain We paid with discount card for injections You can find the discount card on their website HIGHLY RECOMMEND when nothing else has helped
1282,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41623,22,I have suffered from debilitating migraines for over years I feel like I have tried everything Imitrex shots gave me my life back After taking a shot I normally need to lay down for min but then I feel great I used to suffer for at least days I never had any side effects
1283,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41621,3,I have extremely bad migraines and have tried several different medicines Imitrex stat dose injections have really been a lifesaver
1284,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,41612,24,This is a miracle for me Cluster headaches would put me out of commission for days Imitrex gets rid of the intense pain of my eye feeling like it might pop out of my head The first few times I took it I had side effects of the heavy feeling on my chest and in my muscles after x I can take with no side effects Ive only taken it x but still working great
1286,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,41594,18,Works super fast and well Gets rid of my migraines fast when I take with a Motrin BUTit makes me sweat buckets I took it at work before my shift and hours later my migraine was gone but I had sweated through shirts and was visibly dripping It was pretty bad It does it every time I take it so I try not to use it if I can help it
1287,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41587,23,I have taken Imitrex ever since it came out in the s It works and Ill be forever grateful that it does If you like me know what it was like to get migraines before Imitrex came out youll understand why I sing its praise
1288,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41540,9,Severe MigrainesCluster Headaches years Intensityfrequency varies intensity is around point scale frequency is around per week some lasting days I have tried many medications most Triptans Maxalt Zomig Relpax Frova Axert works well for me but when it doesnt I use Alsuma Injection It works like a Epipen injection you give yourself Place the pen against your skin and push hard There is a jolt and then the needle point emerges and you keep it there for seconds The pain from the prick is not bad because the needle is small The jolt is kinda scary I have to brace myself but way worth it It WORKS Some nausea but not much other side effects I usually go to sleep right after I take it
1289,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41538,20,The only medication that works for my migraines that last typically days at a time right side of my head in my eye down the back of my neck and upper back I take the mg tablet every hours or when I feel it coming back on Imitrex kicks in within minutes of taking it As close to instant relief as you can get GREAT medication
1290,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,41516,8,Its quick acting but painful and it made me bruise and bleed a bit It makes me feel nauseated and I vomited once a few minutes after use It also made me feel sleepy like my other migraine pills This just acts quicker and makes you drowsy fast
1291,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41503,17,The injection feels like a rubber band snapped on your skin I recommend the abdomen over the thigh much more comfortable I only bleed slightly and the site only bruised once The triptan effect is fast and intense you feel that rush of the migraine about to go away It makes me sleepy as sumatriptan always has and I nap for less than hour then I am PAIN FREE The nice thing is the triptan effect goes away as rapidly as it comes on which is far better than the lingering quotyuckquot feeling with oral triptans Not just pain reduction not a lessening of the migraine it is gone It has reduced my sick and late days due to migraine from days in to ZERO so far in Will never go without it again
1292,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42291,3,Imitrex shot is a very effective drug for me Have had migraines for decades and was introduced to imitrex after years of having blinding aura then days of suffering in a dark room Imitrex shot works within minutes No pain killer needed Once I give myself the shot I lay down for about an hour Only issues are brief fatigue nausea for a few minutes and a strange prickly sensation in the top of my head which goes away quickly
1293,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,42289,4,So far this medications does help but it makes me very sleepy Generally when I get a bad migraine its debilitating I usually leave work and in bed for the rest of the day So far Ive taken this medication twice and it helps rid the migraine andor lessens it to a dull headache then I need to rest stay hydrated no lights noise or strong smells
1294,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42286,4,Ive been a migraine sufferer since I was years old My Dr prescribed sumatriptan years ago and honestly now I cant live without it I take one tablet and within mins the migraine is completely gone Side effects for me are hot flushes for a few hrs and I have really achy heavy joints the next day anybody else get these side effects
1296,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,42265,15,I have tried this medication in the past and it did not work for me but now after revisiting the drug with years of migraines of no relief I have found that it works well for me now I tend to have extreme nausea and vomiting with my severe headaches so I also use the nasal spay form depending on how nauseated I am They both work well if taken early in the migraine I did however have severe reaction the first times taking it nausea vomiting abdominal upset but I forced myself to take it again Now my experience is quothead tighteningquot which I see can be common with this drug and after about minutes of this I feel a quotlooseningquot and finally relief I have not experienced any other symptoms with tablet form
1298,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42257,1,Works in about minutes for me which is about twice as fast as the pill form Creates a bad taste but well worth it for the faster speed
1299,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42246,1,Sumatriptan tablet is very good within half an hour there a big difference I take it with pain killers and it works wonders Cupping it very good for migraines I know a few people that have done cupping on there head n migraines the have gone
1300,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42241,11,I have been getting migraines off and on since around the age of and am now Most of my migraines are due to my allergies during the springsummer But they seem to be even worse during the colder months This medication works wonders for me The only thing I seem to notice is a bit of dizziness after the medicene wears off But I would much rather have a little dizziness rather than being bedridden lightsound sensitivity migraine and nauseavomiting
1302,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42216,2,Ive suffered from cluster headaches for the last years since I was diagnosed with a growth on my pineal gland Nothing worked until I was put under neurology science in York UK I was put on verapamil tablets and also prednisolone to prevent and sumatriptan as a pain relief when I have an attack I was close to drilling a hole on the side of my head before I was prescribed these meds The problem is they are expensive I am lucky and I have these prescribed under the NHS however they will not prescribe me more than injections per week and sometimes I have these attaches every day sown times twice a day for to weeks Sumitriptan is the best thing ever invented
1303,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42207,11,This drug give me hallucinations And made my body tingle
1304,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42205,5,I take Sumatriptan for menstrual migraines and this medication has been an absolute lifesaver for me If I take a mg tablet when the migraine starts I have relief within minutes If I wait until the migraine is really bad then it takes about an hour to kick in My migraines generally last days and the first dose wears off in about hours so I usually have to take another dose The only side effects I experience are a slight head rush that goes away after about minutes I would recommend trying to take a nap after taking this medication which really helps
1305,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,42175,4,I took this medication as soon as I felt a migraine coming It did not ease the pain I was in bed from pm till am the next day I was hoping I would get better results since its very expensive
1306,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42153,20,Saved my life Nothing else worked Other drugs intensified the headache I much prefer the injection Less of the drug is needed and the effective result occurs more quicklySide effects I can get nightsleep sweats and have quotoddquot dreams that do not otherwise occur
1307,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,42149,13,Imatrex has helped me with my cluster headaches Certain foods trigger these painful headaches and even though I know most of the triggers and even though I try to avoid them its impossible to eat and not have at least one or two of these triggers in my food My doctor tried me on several pain meds for these headaches but nothing worked The headaches got so bad I was literally pulling my hair out and was thinking about suicide Then my doctor gave me Imatrex As long as I know I have access to Imatrex I am fine I finally went to a wonderful neurologist who has been very patient in trying other meds to work with the Imatrex I do take the generic of Imatrex
1308,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42142,10,From the moment I started taking Imitrex in it has worked wonderfully for me with probably only two or three occasions over the years where a headache has persistent It is been my wonder drug I do get very frequent migraines and take as little of it is possible but I will normally take to mg tablets per month with few if any side effects
1309,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,9,42131,6,Ive suffered with tension headache and migraine for years and nothing has ever really helped with the pain until now As soon as I feel one coming one I take one tablet and the pain is gone with minutes The only downside to using this medicine is the side effects I have Hot flushes and a heavy burning sensation in my legs almost like growing pains But I much rather the side effects than the headache
1310,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42129,13,This medication has changed my life I have had migraine since I was age My son lost a lot of time and attention from me because I used to be debilated for from early morning until about pm Only when my doctor prescribed Sumatriptan for me about years ago I have got back quality of life I thank from the bottom of my heart whoever invented this medication Thankfully in UK we have the National Health Service which means I dont have to pay for the medication I probably would find it hard to afford otherwise I worry about all the people around the world who suffer migraine and do not have access to Sumatriptan Forget all the wealth Health is the true wealth for me Thank you Sumatriptan
1313,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,42119,3,I cant believe all the great ratings for this Maybe my skin is just extremely sensitive but this was the most painful injection Ive ever had in my entire life I choose though over belly and I actually screamed so loudly Im sure I scared everyone in the reception area I was not at all prepared for it to hurt as much as it did The unexpected sharp pain only made my headache worse and even paired with a shot of Demerol my headache did not clear
1315,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,42104,10,Ive been using Sumavel Dosepro and Sumavel pill form for over years The Dosepro has relievederased my migraine in less than minutes of the time Its liquid gold in my opinion The pill form is less effective and takes up to hr
1316,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,42096,15,days on medicine caused extreme muscle pains tiredness and weakness Also facial flushing tingling hot and cold flashes blurred vision malaise increased urination lack of concentration
1317,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41494,10,Ive been dealing with episodes of cluster headaches for years Nothing has ever made a dent in the pain besides this and Zomig nasal spray The slight pain of the injection is a very small price to pay to relieve the crushing pain of a cluster headache For me the trick for both medicines is to catch it as early as possible before the headache is full blown Im never more than a minute or two away from a dose Besides feeling a little weak afterwards which would have been worse with the headache anyway so far I dont have any real side effects
1318,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41491,24,Imitrex has truly been a miracle for me Im and Ive been having terrible headaches since as far back as I can remember No over the counter medication ever made any difference in the pain at all years ago I was prescribed Imitrex and it has literally changed my life It normally takes an hour or two for it to kick in for me but when it does it completely takes my headache away I have never had any side effects either
1319,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41484,12,Im yrs old and was diagnosed with cluster headaches in my late s I was prescribed sumatriptan last week due to my new spell which started weeks ago and the medicine is working great for me When ones coming on I take a mg pill and it starts working within minutes I feel and hear crackling noises in my head as well as my nasal cavity and eye socket and miraculously it starts to lift away In some cases though I had to take a second pill because the first didnt work completely but within to minutes Im relaxed and pain free Since theyve taken Cafergot off the market Ive been without any medicine at all trying steroids my neurologist experimented with which didnt work at all Sumatriptan is working
1320,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41476,16,This is a miracle for migraines Works within minutes and migraine GONE You will have energy and get on with your day I am yrs old and have suffered with migraines since teen RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN TO YOUR DR AND ASK FOR THIS MEDICINE SUFFER NO MORE
1322,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41451,28,I completely rely on Imitrex Once I had this the daylong headaches are gone I now know that what I used to call quotsinus headachesquot were migraines I had since a teenager though not bad until into my s My side effects are a little sleepiness and maybe some tiredness but nothing compared to the debilitation of a migraine However I am much more aggressive with eliminating triggers particularly MSG and processed foods and this helps My better diet has reduced my need for Imitrex down to times a month
1323,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,41450,7,I have suffered migraines since I was in grade school Im now My headaches used to come on in the late afternoon and put me in bed for the rest of the day but I would wake up next morning feeling ok Now my headaches come on about in the morning and last days of non stop vomiting and pain The doctor put me on Topamax daily but the side effects keep causing me to overheat in the Texas weather The doctor just put me on sumatriptan mg and I just had an attack days ago I took pill and it did nothing hours later I took a second dose and I still ended up in bed for hours
1324,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41450,15,This medication works for me I did have slight chest discomfort first few times using it No longer experience it Sometimes it makes me feel tired but I continue on and it goes away Headache disappears within mins to hr of taking tablet I have been taking Imitrex and sumatriptan for over years and am thankful the neurologist prescribed it
1325,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41448,14,I suffered for several years before I found a specialist who diagnosed me properly and prescribed this great medicine
1327,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,41441,27,Migraines have become my worst enemy over the past years Thank goodness for Imitrex I started with the pills then the nasal spray and have worked my way up to the shots plus nausea medicines The pills had the least side effects The spray was vile tasting but fast acting and I could take it while working When my headaches worsened they added botox and upgraded me to the injected version I needed something that acted FAST so I could stay in the classroom The down side to the injection is the head rush change of hear rate and the flushing feeling When I inject I have about BAD minutes then I kind of restabilize and about an hour later I usually feel better and capable of continuing to teach
1328,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41439,22,I have migraines that are hormonal in nature and Imitrex has saved me from days worth of pain many a time I also have a gradeschool daughter and if I have a migraine believe me the entire family suffers The pain from a migraine can last days for me so having something that will knock it out in a matter of minutes is in my eyes miraculous It doesnt ALWAYS work especially if I have cluster headaches but of the time it works for me on one dose If the first dose doesnt work I take another and that usually just completely wipes it out
1329,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41427,15,Amazing and totally effective andno side affects
1330,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41395,10,Ive been suffering from headache for over years Headache could last up to a week it was horrible Took so many pain medicines and it didnt work I ended up with craniotomy last year and metal plates on my skull bone I was fine for few monthsno headache Few months ago the headaches came back again Now Im miserable again when the headache comeI got this injection Sumavel DoseProafter the injection my head feels like it explodes and I fell asleep right awayafter an hourtwo the headache is goneits great medicineits working right awaythrough the skin and blood vessels
1332,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41381,7,This medication for the price worked the best I was using this along with Topamax as a daily preventative and also started receiving botox injections I found that after a few months between the botox the Topamax and the Imitrex I was able to use less and less each month
1333,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41377,8,After years of migraines that lasted three days at a time and nothing working to get rid of them this is awesome I was worried about being able to do the injection myself but it wasnt bad It felt like a bee sting Within a minute it felt like the top of my head was going to explode Within minutes it was subsiding It was completely gone in less than an hour There was no quotbuzzy worn out feelingquot like I normally have after my migraines I had plenty of energy and felt great The prescription discount card is a great help too
1334,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10,41373,4,The best medication I have ever taken for my migraines Works fast and I very rarely have to take a second dose I rated it as a
1335,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41346,13,Before Imitrex I had Migraines that would last day I finally went to emergency to get a shot of Demerol and then sometimes it would not workI would be right there with my bowl amp sun glass on waiting my turn I was put on Imitrex when it first came out and the long term effect was not for sure on people Anything is better than a migraine headache I started taking the shots and at first it made me feel a little funny for first minute then it cleared up and within minutes my migraine was gone After using it for a while I developed an immunity to it I then had to use shots My doctor at the time had me stop using it It WAS a great medication for Migraines back then
1337,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,5,41313,6,This is the first time I have used Sumatriptan it was ArrowSumatriptan injection I immediately felt a slight pressure in my chest and a pushing in my temples and the base of my skull and felt tired and weak There was a tingling sensation in my nose and my throat was ultra sensitive It is an hour since I injected and my cluster headache has eased but not gone away yet My eye has stopped streaming and nose not running so fast and I look slightly more human I had hoped for better than this but it is an improvement
1338,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41282,13,I have been on Imitrex for years now and when my Migraine starts Imitrex takes care of it Only a couple of times I had to take the second pill Im on mg as for side effects I have not had any My doctor has me on Topamax to help control them and I keep my Imitrex with me when I need it
1339,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41271,5,This medicine has changed my life it is a surefire defense against debilitating migraines I can actually feel it pushing the headache out of my head One word of caution however in the rare instance I feel a headache coming on and dont have my meds with me or more likely am out of them since the insurance allows only a pill script the headache that I do get is OFF THE CHARTS Its almost like the migraine monster knows I have no defense
1340,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41263,0,Started with Imitrex when it first came out with the big bulky injector kits then got the Statdose kit two syringes in one cartridges that fit in a case with reusable injector pen Injections for bad migraines tablets if I catch them soon enough
1343,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41249,3,The stat dose is a miracle I can finally go on vacations and dont miss out on work I used to be in tears and would be submitted to hospital for a iv
1344,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,41243,5,Imitrex is the best medication for migraines I have taken so far When I first started using it I would get the loopy feeling and slight dizziness Normal right But after a month or two and a few more uses of this medication I started get a burning sensation in my head behind my eyes and progressively got worse with each time I took it The side effects have gotten so bad that now I get coldhot sweats the burning sensation in my head and vomiting I have now switched to a medication that is the prescription strength of Motrin which works just as well
1345,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41224,0,Sumatriptan has changed my life A migraine used to leave me down for the count for hours Now within about minutes my migraines are completely gone I have not experienced any side effects
1346,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,41214,18,This medicine kept the migraine from becoming full blown It made me sleepy and out of sorts but this is better than an agonizing migraine I took it as soon as I saw the visual effect and within min my vision was back to normal However I still had a mild migraine with very little nausea Imitrex made me tired and my body felt heavy It also made my tongue feel swollen but it wasnt But Id take this over a full blown migraine any day It seemed to fast forward the headache rather than it being debilitating like last time I still lay around all day though
1347,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,41198,6,At first I suffered through them This included splitting head pain nausea and vomiting I started using Excedrin after a while which helped if I took it right away Then that started to not work so well anymore I had one really bad one that lasted hours I was still throwing up at pm and I was now throwing up blood I went to the ER and when I finally got in they put me on an IV to hydrate me They then added Imitrex to the bag and I soon started feeling side effects My head felt like I was going to pass out My breathing became labored and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest They said that meant it was working After about two minutes everything was gone I got pills to take at home and they worked okay Not as fast
1348,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41188,8,Imitrex works for me even if I let it get to the really bad headachehate to take because of the tightness in chest and achy throat afterwards Butthey do the job and I always say later I should have taken it in the beginning
1349,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41179,8,Imitrex injection is sometimes the only thing that will stop the headache Even when on Verapamil I can get head bangers that blow through when this happens Imitrex can be the added push
1350,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,41162,18,The first time I took this I got a severe panic attack It felt like I couldnt breathe my heart was racing and chest hurt It did nothing for the pain or any of the other things associated with migraines I did try it once more as per my Dr and it happened all over again Maxalt is what I use now
1351,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41153,1,Review for Sumatriptan Succinate Injection Generic ImitrexI was so impressed I was getting too wordy with the review and it cut me off so Ill get to the point After taking the medication through injection the pill is SO slow to work for me my aura was gone in less than minutes and I was able to continue teaching my students throughout the remainder of the school day I still had a headache and minor side effects like hot flashes tension in my shoulders and obviously pain at injection site but I will take those things over a days long migraine ANY DAY I am so impressed with this medication All symptoms were totally gone without even a minute headache by pm that evening
1354,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41083,21,I suffered with cluster headaches for about years before finally receiving an Imitrex injection in the hospital ER My headache was gone within minutes I thought it was a miracle I do not leave home without it
1355,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,41079,4,I take the generic Sumatriptan This medicine has changed my life I honestly cant see how I would make it through my days if I didnt have this medicine when a migraine comes along I get migraines times a week Taking it does have side effects as most of the time my arms get heavy and tingly I suggest taking it and then sleeping an hour while it kicks in but sometimes that is not possible and you just have to push through it To me its worth it and definitely worth trying
1356,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41072,12,It worked to abort a cluster headache Just as effective but not any more so than the needle version of Imitrexsumatriptan The injection stung quite a bit and left a fairly nasty welt similar to a wasp sting and it bled a little bit but it worked as advertised
1357,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,8,41065,4,If I take Imitrex Nasal spray mg in first min when symptoms of Cluster Headaches start its great chance that my headaches will last max min but sometimes doesnt work at all
1359,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,41014,4,Ive had clusters for as long as I can remember but theyve gotten worse as Ive gotten older First doc prescribed Frova which didnt help at all but the most recent doctor Ive seen prescribed sumatriptan I cant believe how quickly this worked My headaches usually lasted hours even after taking Aleve Sumatriptan has knocked them out in minutes I feel a bit jittery after and have extreme taste sensitivity for a few hours but its well worth it This medicine is a miracle
1360,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,41011,7,Those injections for my headaches that the doctor gave me are amazing I wake up with my headache a lot so I cant even stop them before they start and like this morning theyre usually paired with nausea and I end up throwing upThis injection is awesome though Quick relief without having to make a trip to the ER I usually get Toradol shots at the hospital that make the headache disappear within twenty minutes of so The initial injection of the Sumavel hurt a little and caught me off guard but it felt like a bee sting it just hurt for a second and then it was over It bled a little bit and about a minute after my head started to feel heavy and I felt a little dizzy I went to sleep woke up and feel better
1361,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,40995,9,My first experience with Imitrex was taking it at workwell that was not a good idea I started to feel the migraine coming on so I took it at the first symptoms like I was told and went about my day Im a technician for an ophthalmologist and I started to get a hot flash I stood up and my arms and legs went totally numb Since Im on Topamax too I expect a little tingle but this was a RUSH All this aside about minutes later most of my heavy duty migraine symptoms were thwarted Not gone but a lot better I feel they would have been much better if I had been able to lie down rather than been on my feet working I also still had a pretty decent headache and photophobia the rest of the day
1366,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,40930,25,I hated my experience with Imitrex It made my chest feel strange heart beat increase and I felt very anxious while on it I guess it shortened the duration of my headache but I became very worried and preoccupied by its side effects
1367,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,40916,22,At first I thought it was great no headache Then the more frequently I used the medication to treat my migraines the more debilitating sideeffects I began to experience I could first mitigate the burningpain and weakness in my head neck and jaw and the general feeling of malaisefatigue by the administration of Naproxen or Ibuprofen prior to the Imitrex but then even that ceased to be effective I finally quit after experiencing total body weakness a more severe burningpain in my upper extremeties than ever before accompanied by fluctuating hotcold sensations everywhere else irregular heartbeat and irregular breathing after administration If you experiencing adverse sideeffects it gets worse Please find something else
1368,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40874,3,Imitrex has been a life saver for me I keep a few tablets with me at all times Imitrex relieves my headaches of the time It relives my migraines but it also works on all the other types of headaches too At least for me it does I usually only need one mg tablet but on a rare occasion I will have to take a second tablet to minutes after the first to get relief I dont know what Id do without this medicine I guess Im one of the lucky ones because I suffer no side effects at all when taking Imitrex
1369,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,40855,10,Imitrex took away my migraine but I could not function on it I had to lay down completely still and go to sleep because it made me so nauseous I felt like vomiting every time I moved I was extremely dizzy and it made my skin painful to the touch Even after the migraine went away I still felt out of it the rest of the day I would definitely ask for samples before paying for the prescription
1370,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40843,7,I have suffered from terrible migraines for the past years and saw no relief in sight Once I tried this needless injection it has changed my life for the better I was nervous to give myself the injection but I had my sister help me for moral support The injection did sting and bleed just a little but any migraine sufferer would not mind a little sting over the pain of a migraine I did get lightheadeddizzy for a few minutes however my migraine was gone within minutes Awesome medicine it gave me my life back I highly recommend it
1372,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40834,9,I was nervous about the pain and even though its needlefree I have a bit of a needle phobia and the idea of any injection even without a needle was pretty rough for me to get over After talking myself up for about minutes I was finally able to give myself the dose It hurt a lot more than I was expecting and bled more than my neurologist and pharmacist said it would so immediately after administering it I was pretty apprehensive I felt the side effects most people have reported weakness dizziness heaviness etc but I also had some nausea and I was really tired I felt nearimmediate relief of about of my migraine and then took a power nap for about minutes When I woke up I felt like a completely new person
1373,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40830,2,As a disabled veteran with chronic post traumatic stress disorder I have migraines or days a week for years now The VA refuses to treat my severe pain properly The VA will only give me NINE pills a month which is not enough The VA pharmacist told me it is because the medicine is too expensive None of the codeine medicines work After eight years with migraines sumatriptan is the only medicine that works for me What is wrong with the VA staff They do not care if I am in severe pain
1374,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40827,5,year migrainer Hands down this is the best overall migraine abortive I have used for over year and of the time it takes of the migraine away Biggest plus is no needle the sensation feels like a rubber band snap My other abortive is Treximet and Topamax mg daily for preventative
1375,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40807,12,I have been using Imitrex for over a year now It works very well for me I had some trouble with chest pain for awhile My Neurologist told me to try to tablet mg This has worked for me The headache goes away and all side effects are diminished I found that the side effects varied depending on the manufacturer There is something like a variance in dosage a mg tablet can contain as little as mg or as much as mg of Sumatriptan Also some coatings dissolve faster than others therefore more severe side effects if the Sumatriptan is absorbed too rapidly
1376,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40805,3,Pill form did not work for me but the statdose stops the pain within twenty mins most times Side effects are tightness in chest weakness in arms but this goes away within an hour or so Better than that little devil with the big hammer beating the inside of my head I take it as soon as I feel that I am getting a migraine and not just a common headache I try not to overuse it as I have a fear it will stop working and it is the only thing that works short of an ER visit for Demerol
1377,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40775,7,Imitrex has long been the quotgoldquot standard for quotmigraine sufferersquot quot cluster headache suffers a much rarer but more painful form of headachequot and even those who suffer from just occasional really painful headaches but not frequent enough to be characterized as the quotmigrainequot or quotclusterquot variety After speaking to your physician about the safety of you using Imitrex ask for Sumavel Dose from Zogenix Prefilled units that get the medication in your blood within minutes Amazing
1378,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40724,6,I have tried both the injection and tablet and its has worked wonders I have suffered with migraines since I was middle school now yrs old and this is the first medicine that has given me any relief The side effects only last for about minutes so its no problem The only issue I have is after about or hours the migraine seem to start up right Either way any relief is better than suffering through a migraine
1380,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40710,7,As long as I take it right when the migraine starts it completely stops the pain
1382,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40702,4,I love this medicine The only caveat The difficulty in filling the actual prescription I have all the side effects you have all mentioned but as everyone said well worth it Im a teacher and in my last two weeks of school I need the insurance issues to clear up so I can pick up the rest of my medicines
1383,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40695,1,This is a MIRACLE medicine for me and is most effective when taken at the onset of a migraine Within minutes I can feel the relief setting in Within an hour I have no sign of a headache or the usual symptoms of vomiting blurred vision ringing in the ears etc If I deny that I feel a migraine coming on and take the pill after the headache has progressed it takes a little longer for the pill to work Before this medicine I had become a prisoner in my own life not daring to venture far from home THANK YOU Imitrex for giving me back my life
1385,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40677,9,Best one for me in the some yrs Ive had to deal with them Ive taken mg pills all along
1386,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40676,6,Ive suffered from migraines since I was in the rd grade and I am now I take Topamax every night to try and control my headaches but when I get a really bad one I use the Sumavel HATE HATE HATE needles So this works for me very good There is pain with the injection but compared to the migraine its nothing A little bleeding at the site and always a bruise I can instantly feel the medicine working in my body and within minutes my migraine is gone Its my miracle
1387,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,40652,8,I have headaches everyday I get them in the morning and vomiting is first thing Imitrex injections clear them right up
1388,Sumatriptan,Migraine,3,40605,11,Ive never felt so sick in my life My blood pressure shot up to the upper s and I felt like I was going to pass out
1389,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40604,6,Im years old and have used Imitrex for almost years No side effects except leg pain for about hours as if I overused in a workout Was on mg tabs for a long time with mg selfinjections as necessary Now just taking mg as I get fewer and less intense headaches now This medicine is worth trying but ask for EKG first if the doctor doesnt order it this can help check for heart okay first
1390,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,40559,10,I just use the Sumavel it stings in application area for minutes but my headache was gone in about minutes I felt little dizzy after wards Highly recommended and well worth it
1391,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40543,11,I am and suffered with migraines since about age didnt get Imitrex until my early s It has saved my life without it I was worthless for a day Fortunately I can cut mg into and it works for me I would lay down for minutes and headache gone Recently I have had to use the generic and didnt think anything of it and have found I need to take a mg and now I get side effects I didnt before Just the weird feelings from vasodilatation in my chest and sometimes my legs Sometimes the mg doesnt take it completely away I am a nurse and will look for another alternative because I would have to pay for boxes out of pocket if I want the brand
1392,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,40186,6,Ive tried a lot of migraine drugs and this one didnt help me
1393,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40184,7,Imitrex pills worked for me for a few years but then it stopped being as effective and I had to take Then that stopped working so I tried Imitrex statdose the injections and they work wonders They hurt a lot but the pain in my leg after I give it to myself is far less horrible than the migraine pain I give myself the shot and lie down for about minutes and Im fine Maybe a little pain but I feel much better Im also on Timolol Neurontin and Cymbalta and my migraines have reduced in number and then this helps when I get them And the shot works after youve had the migraine for a while you dont have to take it at the first sign to get relief
1394,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,40183,16,Imitrex makes me more nauseous than I am with just the headache My neck and shoulders get very stiff and it takes more than an hour to feel any relief As others have said however if I am able to take this medicine and lie down it does wonders Life just isnt that practical though so I cant use it anymore
1397,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40148,1,It works every time I use it but I feel that my migraines are much more frequent since taking first Imitrex and then the generic
1399,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40136,11,My doctor gave me a sample of Imitrex when it first came out It was a MIRACLE drug for me Up to that time nothing I took helped the headaches I got Ive used it since Over time my headaches have gotten less maybe with age But I keep it with me all the time just in case I quotdont leave home without itquot
1400,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,40127,5,Thank God for Imitrex The first tablet I took stopped the headache and didnt have any side effects the first time The next time I took it I felt shaky The only side effect that I get from Imitrex is jaw pain But at least my migraines are no longer in my back Just make sure that if you are needing two mg tablets a day for several days in a row and you still arent getting relief Consider a preventive or have a backup I dont have nearly as many headaches anymore
1401,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40119,5,Sumatripan Injections probably saved my life The only thing that works on my cluster headaches The injections are expensive but my doctor backed me up in my battle with my insurance company Works in minutes or less major side effect that I have found is burning but Ill take that rather than the headache
1403,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40101,27,Something that really works for me when my schedule allows is to take a short nap after taking Imitrex I wake up with little discomfort My head is clear I can think One of the worst symptoms of my migraines is that I cannot stay focused on a task If I am unable to nap the Imitrex has little effect on me This is horrible when you are at work as many of you know
1405,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40092,0,Amazing drug usually cures my migraines within minutes after taking
1407,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40077,4,If you can stand the burning sensation then its all worth it Its the only thing that helps my migraines I used to get them for days on end and I dont get them so often anymore I also add a trip to the chiropractor as well
1408,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1,40062,14,Did not work for chronic cluster headache at all
1409,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40030,4,I have had migraines since I was years old they are very strong in my family I have been using the Imitrex injections since I was I am now I am always amazed at how well the Imitrex works because I get migraines so often I usually wait until my migraine is pretty bad before taking an injection You are supposed to take it at the first sign of a migraine but if I did that I would take an injection almost daily I take the injection lie down for minuted and the migraine is totally gone Seriously The only side effects I have are a tinglytight feeling that lasts minutes and as of the last years a red itchy injection site reaction that resolves in hours or less
1410,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,40015,17,Imitrex would eventually stop the headache but like others have stated my heart feels like its about to jump out of my chest and I would get a worse headache before it got better
1411,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,39982,9,Injection is the best
1412,Sumatriptan,Migraine,5,39976,16,Im a migraines per week person When I first tried Imitrex I thought I had found my own personal miracle Even on days that I didnt have a full blown migraine I would still have pain and this was the first time I felt completely pain free in years Unfortunately the honeymoon wore off after about months I used Imitrex quite frequently during that time and had wonderful results even though sometimes I had to take two pills to really do the job But after eight months pills werent doing the job my headache was still lingering
1413,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,39971,11,I have suffered migraines for years This is the only medication that works for me If I run out of it it will be a trip to the ER and hours of vomiting and stacks of paperwork and minutes of ER doctor interrogations for sureI have Imitrex in my purse
1414,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39970,3,I have been a sufferer from what was thought to be very bad headache attacks but as I later began to doubt this I was told by my GP that my headaches could actually be migraine attacks I was given sumatriptan tablets to see if this would help in combating the onset of my headaches and stop them all together and not just preventing a headache from developing into a migraine I used to suffer from full blown migraines from time to time once or twice a month and less severe attacks in between Now as soon as I begin to feel any kind of eye or neck strain or light sensitivity I know am going to be okay Ask your GP about Sumatriptan medication Highly recommended
1415,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39969,4,Because my migraines start while I am asleep I do not get the quotlightsquot prior to onset I start by having ringing in my ears around pm then around am the pain starts If I take a shot at that time I can function during the day If not around to am I awake with a fullblown blindinoneeye migraine and I cannot function for about hours Later it feels like someone took a baseball bat to my head and it hurts
1416,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39968,8,Works great for me Can take or tablet most of time Have only taken whole tab on rare occasions Migraine is usually triggered by irregular or lack of sleep or tension this medicine makes me sleepy Most times Im functional within minutes no side effects
1418,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,39948,12,Only thing that works for clusters Within miniutes pain is gone Thank Goodness for this medicine Only wish you could take more than doses in a hour peroid
1419,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39911,9,Imitrex nasal sprays changed my life I developed migraines when I was about years old At that time the doctor would simply prescribe pain killers for treatment but they did nothing They only helped me sleep for a few hours and then I would wake back up to the headache again After seeing a neurologist I was prescribed Imitrex I have tried all three forms of the medication the pills did not work as well for me because I always vomit with a migraine I simply did not get enough doses with the injections to last a month only two in a prescription But with the nasal sprays I receive each month and they work GREAT
1421,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,39890,22,Imitrex does the trick of getting rid of my migraine every time but the side effects are a little rough I feel as though my neck and chest are tightening and achy but if I go to sleep about minutes after taking Imitrex I miss the side effects happening to me and just wake up feeling better
1422,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39885,23,God bless Imitrex I can take the injection either at the start of a migraine or right in the middle of it and it works like a charm each time I dont know what I would do without it My migraines were crippling but thanks to Imitrex I have my life back
1423,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,39854,2,Imitrex injections have worked like a miracle Have used it since they first came out Have had two minor heart problems in the past years The most recent one last week Was informed I cant take Imitrex anymore Dont know what Ill do Im a year old male and have had migraines for years Only the last years have been controlled
1424,Sumatriptan,Not Listed / Othe,10,39822,1,Works really GOOD and FAST
1425,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39770,5,Great drug
1426,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,39765,9,I find Imitrex to be very effective against my migraines as long as I take it at the start of one The first and second time I took Imitrex I experienced stomach cramps The next time I had to take it I had eaten shortly before and this greatly reduced the cramping If Im nauseous I obviously wont be able to eat a full meal but the cramps do seem to be decreasing each time I take it anyway The only other side effects I have are a burning sensation in my nose and a sore throat which are both tolerable Imitrex is very expensive but definitely worth it to me I can take a tablet lay down for an hour or two and then get back up to live life again
1427,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39764,15,I switched from mg to the shots which are mg I found that if I lay down for minutes after a shot I get up and feel as if I never had the headache
1428,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,39735,5,I have used this drug for several years now and have had good success with it I am on the mg and for the most part this will do the trick if I catch it in time
1430,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39695,9,I love this medicine Before I would always worry about the next time I was going to get a headache I couldnt work or play with my son I hated it But now if I get one I can just take my imitrex and minutes later its gone like I never had a headache at all The only thing I dont like is it is pricey but I will pay because it works very well Now that I have tried it I couldnt live without it
1431,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,39658,4,This drug is the only thing apart from being knocked outthat works Yes the injections are expensive but what a life saver never leave home without them
1432,Sumatriptan,Migraine,6,39627,12,Imitrex worked for me only when I could take the medicine at the onset of a migraine If I had a full blown migraine it didnt help
1434,Sumatriptan,Not Listed / Othe,8,39600,2,The tablets eased migraine in about mins I feel a bit spaced out but compared to the migraine its nothing
1435,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,39567,4,Imitrex injection has worked well for me for the past several years but sometimes it doesnt last more than hours and I need a second injection Pills dont work as well nasal spray doesnt work at all for me The only side effects I have are flushing with sweating and some drowsiness Im just glad to have it as I get a few migraines a month I definitely recommend it
1436,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7,39567,16,the first few years i was prescribed imitrex i thought it was a miracle drug now after ten years i find that i need to add excedrine migraine with it and i still have residual pain stillit sure beats a full blown migraine
1439,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,39538,16,These injections are a God send for Clusterers The ONLY drawback that I experienced was the expense which forbids me from using them on a regular basisbut the tablets are a good substitute just takes much longer to work The injections work almost instantly
1441,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,39522,4,Injection WORKS in minutes and you can have your life back Only thing I dont like is the minutes Hot flashes that can soak your clothing amp make your pain a times more intense Just wait it out No more pain no more loud noises amp no more bright lights I do not like the pill takes too long
1442,Sumatriptan,Migraine,2,40543,2,I have used Zomig mg for years and often one half of a tablet zaps the headache within minutes without any side effects at all Since becoming eligible for Medicare my prescription plan has forced me to use the generic sumatriptan Sumatriptan does not work at all for me I wish I could afford to take my Zomig again it is a wonder drug
1443,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40540,4,I use Imitrex at the start of my aura which is usually minutes long and once the aura is gone the headache hits me I add a Vicodin pill with the Imitrex and usually lay down when and where I can It seems to work for me The only side effects I have are a stiff neck and upper back and grogginess for a day or two I keep Imitrex in my car at work the boat and my golf bag
1444,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40539,10,The magic migraine medicine Im years old and have suffered from moderately severe migraines since I was The list of different drugs Ive taken over the years is too long to recite and the only other drug that has been effective in any way is FioricetFiorinal but I develop a tolerance to Fiorinal I was skeptical when I first tried Imitrex but have become a believer I have taken both nasal spray and tablets and both work quickly and thoroughly with NO SIDE EFFECTS Truly the magic miracle migraine medicine for which I am sincerely grateful
1445,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40537,13,I have high regard for Imitrex And the generic first provided by Dr Reddy was equal to the original Imitrex However I have recently been required to use a different generic and it is basically worthless I was taking milligrams and having the migraine gone within an hour Now a milligram tablet has little effect and I usually have to take a second milligram tablet to get any relieve I would sure like to know how the generic industry works because for me it does not seem to be quite up to speed at least with the drug that I need most
1446,Sumatriptan,Migraine,4,40480,5,While it did make the pain stop it didnt help the other symptoms I have It also left a dull aching pressure in my face made my chest hurt and my hair felt as though it was being pulled I found out later it is not supposed to be used by people whove had atypical migraines which Ive had
1447,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,7,40479,15,I take sumatriptan for the onset of my migraines and nausea that come along with my CVS On bad days they help a lot The only thing is I usually have to take more than one dose and the medication is expensive even with insurance
1449,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,40412,13,This medicine works fast and it is the best I have had so far for acute cluster headache Highly recommended
1450,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40409,15,Doctor gave me a sample and a prescription of this to try I have used Treximet with great results but it took too long for the medicine to into my system to counter the migraine The Sumavel works GREAT HOWEVER it does hurt The initial injection is painful I was left with a welt and a tender spot for hours afterwards The injection pain is well worth the relief I do get the burning sensation at the bottom of my brain stem seconds after the injection and feel very weak This is all normal as I got the same feeling when I start Treximet Luckily my insurance company covers it
1452,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,40382,8,Fast relief after injecting Havent had many other treatments I use for cluster headaches
1454,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40360,4,I have used both the pill and the injection form of Imitrex and they are both amazing The first time I was given a shot was in the walkin clinic the first time I had a migraine After a very weird initial sensation of kind of a quotbuzzquot I could actually feel the headache dissipating The pill form works just as well but like some other reviewers stated it does work best if you can lay down for a while
1455,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40345,5,I had migraines years ago and they were debilitating I had to be alone in a dark room I had trouble remembering my own name It was as if I had had a stoke Eventually I seem to have outgrown themI suspect some people label bad headaches quotmigrainesquot when they arent My wife has CFS and has serious real migraines about once a week Imitrex is nothing short of a miracle medication for her Nothing else helps The main negative is the cost about for a box of about six nasal sprayers She will use four to defeat one headache Insurance only pays for two boxes a month and she needs at least three With copays we end up spending about a month on Imitrex
1456,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10,40344,23,Had migraines since I was Thirty years later and they are worse Have tried Maxalt Treximet butalbital Excedrin migraine and Zomig to name the ones I remember Tried a sample of Sumavel DosePro this month It is the only medication that stopped the pain Took minutes to stop a bad migraine on a scale and another minutes to be back to functional Was a bit disoriented and dizzy for that first minutes Relpax is my typical drug of choice nowadays but it doesnt stop the bad ones It only stops the ones that I catch right away But this Sumavel is my new knight in shining armor I dont know how expensive it is yet but Im headed back to the doctor this week to find out
1457,Sumatriptan,Migraine,8,40330,11,I have had migraines since I was but theyve been getting worse and worse and I decided it was time to go to a doctor I went in and they gave me Sumavel DosePro to see if the medicine was effective The initial quotinjectionquot was awful It hurt as bad as my migraines did only in my thigh Then I felt extremely dizzy and my whole body was sore and I had trouble breathing They let me rest for about minutes before sending me home with a sample of Treximet I got home and took a nap for about minutes When I woke up I felt better than I had in months Finally my head felt clear and I had energy back As much as the initial pain and discomfort was it only lasted about an hour in comparison to the day migraines I was getting before
1458,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40304,5,This medicine works great for my migraine headaches I experience drowsiness and a heaviness or tightness in my head and neck but on minimally My headaches are usually gone within an hour or two Sometimes the drowsiness is nice because it helps me sleep through the pain I would definitely recommend this product
1461,Sumatriptan,Migraine,9,40282,9,Im years old and have experienced migraines since age Imitrex is the best drug Ive used I take mg at the first sign and it prevents it of the time If taken after the headache starts it stops the pain within hour and much faster if I lay down Yes there are mild side effectsdrowsiness sensitivite to hot and cold but it sure is better than a headache
1462,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40281,13,Injections are expensivebut they are the only thing that I have found that work for my cluster headaches Truly a lifesaver The burning sensation is ugly but better than the viciousness ripping of my head to pieces

1468,Sumatriptan,Migraine,1,39509,31,Horrible Made my chest tighten up and did nothing for my migrane I ended up in the ER
1469,Ibudone,Pain,7,41286,27,I just started taking this medicine I have been taking Hydrocodone with acetaminophen for pain since but recently discovered that there exists a variation with a medicine that would address inflammation in addition for pain and wondered why for all these years no one suggested I take that variant I specifically asked for it because I have inflammation I take it because I have debilitating pain in my lumbarsacral spine in my left parietal brain and I have IC I also have triple major scoliosis and major depression
1470,Triple Antibiotic,Bacterial Skin Infection,10,42855,0,AAA ointment it like gives you wolverine speed healing I work in the food service industry red lobster yay and I get a lot of cuts when I work dish but all I need is to put a on little Neosporin covered with a bandaid overnight and the next day its like nearly healed I ruined up my hand because my roommates dog chews up everything and she chewed the handle of the garden trowel and it gave me a massive blister that immediately broke open and got ripped off so after the naked angry red lower layer of skin dried out a little bit I covered it with a thin layer of AAA and put a bandaid over it for two nights and now its almost healed I tell everyone all you need is neosporin and a bandaid and it works
1472,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,1,43029,3,Absolute trash This medication DID NOT relieve my pain Just another rubbish medication to make drug companies wealthy
1473,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,5,42960,7,It works ok for my mild back pain It is not very effective for my severe back pain and broken rib
1474,Ultram ODT,Back Pain,7,42767,85,I have been on tramadol for many years for fibromyalgia back pain I take six mg a day It does in fact help It makes it bearable most of the time However when its at its worst the medicine doesnt faze it I would recommend a second prescription of something much stronger for occasional pain maybe a month if that Doctors and lawmakers need to realize that people with pain that will never get better and will progressively get worse need relief Unfortunately that is going to involve addictive medication But their addiction isnt the high Its the addiction to function and to live a productive life We crave these medications because we know without them our quality of life is very low
1475,Ultram ODT,Pain,10,42724,28,You can use ultram to detox yourself from harder stuff like OXY or H I used it before for withdrawal symptoms and it worked great In case ur ever withdrawing bad and have some it will help
1476,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,5,42467,27,I use ultramTramadol mg for breakthrough pain usually Normally in that capacity they work okay Prefer them to having to use a second opioid that makes me drowsy or more constipated Right now it has become my only pain med and taking max dose of hrs is a joke If you have real pain long term I find a common opinion among chronic pain sufferers that this is true
1477,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,10,42407,59,I have to say this med has helped me a lot it has taken my pain from to I drive a semi so Im very limited on what I can take Also sitting in that seat for hours on end would make me want to hang it up The pain was so bad then I was put on tramadol now I can play with my kids right after driving for hours and just be a little stiff n sore instead of going straight to bed cause of the pain Plus cigarettes tasted so nasty I had no problem quitting when I started
1478,Ultram ODT,Chronic Pain,8,41813,68,I have been taking Ultramtramadol for fifteen years fourday It is usually but not always effective I often have to add the NSAID Naprosyn I have neuropathy and other side effects from chemo and osteoarthritis also from chemo Many joints have no cartilage I am concerned about chemical dependency and consciously avoided codeine or morphine The Tramadol gets me through the average pain but not the severe pain I really wish someone would come up with an analgesic that was both effective and nonaddictive and did not diminish alertness and effectiveness
1481,Ultram ODT,Pain,10,40875,105,I have been using tramadol for eight years for joint and muscle pain the result of Lyme Disease which was undetected for more than a year I have NO adverse effects The one major problem I have had is since the medicine has now been classified a narcotic my doctor now hesitates to prescribe it even though I have taken the same dosage for eight years with no reduction of effectiveness or need to increase dosage
1483,Daliresp,COPD,7,41311,51,I have been using Daliresp for week now It appears to have improved my breathing but I have several of the sideeffects Now Im having problems with diarrhea anxiety and trouble sleeping Ive got a call into my doctor now to see if the sideeffects will go away If they dont Ill have to go back to Advair
1484,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,9,41286,45,Been on Daliresp for weeks now and I feel great no side effects I feel so good I forget to take my inhaler twice a day Thank you for this amazing medication
1485,Daliresp,COPD,5,41125,66,Originally I had no side effects on Daliresp and noticed better breathing but after two months I noticed a moderate tremor PCP put me on primidone for benign essential tremor After another month the tremor increased significantly and I asked my pharmacist what drugs could be causing this After she told me Daliresp I went online to the manufacturers website and discovered that primidone should NOT be used with Daliresp Since it is the weekend and my tremors are continuing to increase to the prevention of some normal activities Ive stopped using both until I can talk to doctors on Monday
1487,Daliresp,COPD,9,41108,69,Been on Daliresp for months No weight loss or stomach issues Has greatly improved shortness of breath and no bronchitis flare ups Before Daliresp you could count on at least to flare ups per year
1488,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,3,41089,43,Same as previous comment Made me sick to my stomach serious diahrea Only took for days and felt terrible like I had the flu It did help the breathing but not enough to put up with the side effects
1489,Daliresp,COPD,10,40979,54,My husband learned about Daliresp mcg after being in ICU for a monthBreathing has improved a great deal
1490,Daliresp,COPD,10,40958,79,Wow this pill has helped my father big time He has been on it since August of and no exacerbation since then My father had of them last winter but thanks to this product none since hes been taking it His doctor also said that it would take a while to kick in however so far so good and he claims that he can breath better
1491,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,3,40925,47,Dalliresp did open me up but the side effects were bad so I had to stop it Diarrhea nausea so bad I had to take medicine for it
1493,Daliresp,COPD,1,40860,77,Got prescribed this as Im allergic to prednisone On it for weeks but only taking of the pill daily with food as it was making me quite nauseated and continues but not as bad A little apprehensive about taking a new medicine FDA approval
1494,Daliresp,COPD,9,40849,87,Have been on Daliresp for one month now no problems and seems to help Can feel a difference in my shortness of breath So far so good
1495,Daliresp,COPD,10,40836,79,No side effects at all
1496,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,43061,1,Ive been taking this medication for over a month I couldnt take it twice a day as that made my stomach hurt badly I take pill a day and works like a miracle I used to look for bathrooms everywhere i went It was embarrassing Almost had accidents several times because the diahrrea was so badThe only bad thing I can really say is that IF I miss a dose or take it late my diahrrea comes back immediately with a vengeance So just remember to be vigilant in your schedule Otherwise best medicine ever
1499,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,43032,4,Nobody has mentioned this but this medication makes me have to pee more often
1500,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,43024,6,My miracle drug Been taking for about a year now I finally have a life
1501,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,43015,5,Ive been dealing with IBS several years to the point where it has taken over my life virtually homebound Started trying the FODMAP diet which my doctor hasnt even heard of and was gaining some control over my IBS Then he gave me some samples of both Viberzi and Creon The first day I tried both meds I was a constipated drugged crying my eyes out basket case It stopped my bowel movements all together No BM the first day stomach felt bloated and tight and I was in a stupor The Creon SEVERELY exacerbated my depression Second day I took a pill of Viberzi only and had a really sedated feeling and slept the day away Not as much belly pain Thinking about taking at bedtime
1504,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7,43002,5,This medication has managed my diarrhea attacks very well but the stomach discomfort that I experience when taking it is starting to make me consider discontinuing it Hoping some of you have suggestions
1505,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42995,13,Ive lived with IBS for as long as I can remember I worked in a high stress career since the s In the s I went to my doctor to get help His advice avoid foods that upset your stomach The trouble was that everything did this I could not sit through a meal at a restaurant without stopping part way through to run to the bathroomI moved to East Tennessee I established myself with a new doctor As part of his initial review of my health the IBS came into discussion He recommended a new drug Viberzi To say it has been lifechanging is an understatement I cannot tell you how great it is to be able to eat and not have IBS immediately One more thing my gallbladder was removed in no problems or side effects for me
1506,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42990,8,This drug has done wonders for my IBSD Ive suffered for years and was skeptical this would help I was at my wits end and was withdrawing from everyone Now I go on my way and do not have to find the bathroom everywhere I go just in case Everyone should give it a try as it may work for you despite negative reviews Every body is different so its worth trying it for yourself Best of luck
1507,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42985,5,After one week I went from having diarrhea times a day to normal movements twice average a day What a Godsend
1508,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42972,4,Finally some relief This is a hands down miracle drug for IBS Not a cure but Id say it controls my symptoms of the time which is outstanding
1510,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42969,5,mg x daily Diarrhea to the point of incontinence Told by doctor to take immodium minutes before eating anything Ended up being bloated and still have explosive diarrhea I stopped taking Viberzi and my untreated IBS D symptoms are a heck of a lot better than on the medication dont get me wrong I still have urgent needs but at least I can go back to the gym
1511,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42967,6,I took Viberzi for about a week and then I had acute pancreatitis for three weeks I have my gallbladder I dont drink and aside for IBSD I dont really have health issues This is a dangerous drug
1512,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42944,2,I have been using this with good results for almost a year I did have some break through diahrrea on occasion What I would like to know is has anyone stopped taking it after taking for a while I had been using the dollar coupon but now the price has gone up and the coupon is not valid So I am waiting for insurance approval But my doctor gave me samples and I have ran out I have called my doctor three times today to get more samples as they said they would give them to me until insurance comes throught but they never got back to me So I will just not have them to take Has anyone had experience with just stopping and if so what were the effects Thank you for any help Guess Ill stock up on imodium until I hear from them
1513,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42940,6,Horrible pain Was hospitalized Terrible drug
1518,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42890,9,Went my doctor in tears diarrhea was so bad it was up to or more times a day Stomach pain everything I ate made me sick My doctor gave me the FODMAP diet to follow and to go gluten free he also prescribed Viberzi I took the first tablet that evening mg twice a day In less than hours my diarrhea had stopped and the pain was gone I feel strictly following the FODMAP diet along with Viberzi did the trick Been taking Viberzi for a month and a half I had one bout of severe diarrhea when I ate a biscuit and boy did I feel the pain It took hours for it to stop Im one of those people who just cant eat gluten
1519,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42890,21,I have been taking VIBERZI for a little over days and it has all but eliminated my issues with chronic diarrhea that have had for forty years The first week I had some stomach bloating but that quickly subsided I can actually go places and not constantly trying to figure out where the closest restroom is It is literally changing my life
1520,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42888,4,Have Short Bowel with IBD over years Tried this medication and felt like a hat was crushing my head the first day than followed by increasing worse headache bordering on migraines Pain in my stomach was only surpassed by the pain in my back just under the ribcage probably liver location Nauseated constantly too Hate this ridiculously expensive medication
1521,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42881,12,Worked the second day I took it and I have been on it since Had IBSD for months and was having trouble getting ANY kind of food to work with me I can actually eat now and not have to make a run for the restroom the minute I swallow the first or second bite Thanks to all the medchemists clinicians volunteers toxicologists and people who worked on it and made this drug a reality
1522,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42871,14,I struggled with severe IBSD for years Viberzi began working on day of taking itIt has changed my life I am able to function and participate in activities outside of my home I was having water diarrhea times DAILY I have been on Viberzi for days and I have only experienced bouts of diarrhea
1523,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42866,10,Im baffled by reports of this not working I tried Xifaxin and was flushed out for days worse than before then on first day of taking Viberzi it stopped yrs IBSD tried everything amp only Lotroxex worked prior to Blk Box It worked with FIRST pill for me I might suggest doing as I did which was starting on mg x day then on nd week to mg day I also did extensive research and while I can eat whatever I want One MUST not drink and if you do maybe beer or wine once or twice a week due to liver enzyme and prostrate side effect possibility so NOT for heavy drinkers That said I have been on months now and have had JUST TWO upset stomachs THIS IS NORMAL amp glad that Rx allows bad food or virus to come thru VIBERZI
1524,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42860,15,Why would one take a medication for abdominal pain when one of the side effects is abdominal pain
1525,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42857,13,I had to take Imodium daily in order to fend off diarrhea and the constant bathroom breaks It has impacted every aspect of my life I was afraid to eat when a bathroom wasnt readily available As I grew older the condition became worse I would eat and have to go immediately A normal day out with the wife and kids stopping for lunch would create a great deal of anxiety Should I eat can I eat and would I make it to a bathroom on time My working career took into account how accessible bathroom facilities were Vibrenzi worked to end diarrhea and has limited my bathroom calls However I get extremely tired minutes after taking the dosage and remain so all day Dry mouth and gas are also a problem Price cost is a pill
1526,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42843,14,Actually it slows it down But after a year on it I was in the ER times with pain in upper GI tract I guess my liver didnt like it and I got drug induced hepatitis Quit taking it slowed down on sodium intake Processed foods Watch diet Thats it
1527,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42836,18,Ive been having success for years controlling my symptoms with probiotics and a sugarfree spicefree diet but thought maybe with Viberzi I could eventually get back to eating anything I want again You know be quotnormalquot Wrong After just a few days of taking it I had pain like I have never felt before in my life shooting up my back and stomach to the point that I was vomiting nonstop and shooting pangs of diarrhea Isnt that what this drug is supposed to cure It was like the worst case of food poisoning but with indescribable pain I remember saying quotIll take IBSd over this any dayquot I am back on my probiotics and my sugar free diet and finally recovered again Im glad that it works for some people but not for me Yikes
1528,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42835,12,Worked for maybe a week then stopped working Stopped for a couple weeks and tried again does nothing at all back to Immodium that has been working some for years
1529,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42824,19,Ive had IBS D for as long as I can remember Viberzi has fixed that Im living a normal life I can now go out and just enjoy the day without having to worry about my stomach So thankful
1530,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42822,16,I have had IBSD for nearly years and getting worse as time goes on Flare ups after everything I ate Traveling anywhere is horrible and I could never eat the day before flying until I landed then would eat My Dr prescribed this medicine and I have been taking it weeks So far so good with only diarrhea episodes That is really good for me I hope it changes my life and everyone suffering from this frustrating condition Im sorry to the ones it didnt help I hope you can find some relief soon
1531,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42820,16,Started this five months ago and in the first week I was totally fine It stopped all symptoms Felt great Ate what I wanted After being diagnosed over years ago and managed well with diet most of the past years A year ago I was back to trips to the bathroom with immediate diarrhea daily at least days per week Viberzi was amazing Went to pharmacy this week to pick up refill Had Note to call doctor Had to take me off immediately Has been black listed for patients without gall bladder Doc wanted me on on lotronex Has also been black listed for tissue death in intestines I stopped medication on Thursday and I have had immediate resumption of diarrhea Cant leave the house Have to travel to a conference for work all week
1532,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42819,19,For the last years I have had issues with IBSD Id say I would have a quotnormalquot bowel movement of the time with about occurrences of rushing to the bathroom per day and the rest of the time just unpleasant bowel movements My Gastro prescribed mg Viberzi and it worked almost immediately Id say in the first week I had two occurrences of diarrhea and the rest of the time I was quotnormalquot After a month I have had diarrhea a total of times and had some of my best bowel movements in the last years Ive even eaten Taco Bell several times and not had to go It is truly freeing to not feel nervous about whether I would make it home in time after eating dinner
1534,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42800,23,Was constipated most of the weeks I was on it One night all of the sudden I had horrible cramping under my rib cage and a pain that went all the way up my spine The pain was so horrendous I was crawling on the floor crying in pain screaming in a pillow as to not wake my children I would scream at times and nothing would come out I had tears and mucous coming down my face I literally thought I was in hell I have NEVER experienced pain like this in my life I have birthed children and lived with Ulcerative ColitisIBD for years I know what pain is I wound up going to the ER and reporting this to my GI doctor So much for this quotmiracle pillquot I was so hoping this was going to work
1535,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42800,14,For me this medication did absolutely nothing went back to my usual daily Imodium after one miserable week of quotgoingquot almost nonstopBUT even though is was useless for me I say try it out we are all different Best wishes to us all
1536,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42794,23,I use this medication after long years with IBS D I already used it months and for me working great my life go back to normal
1537,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,4,42792,7,At the time I think Viberzi worked for my IBS but it made me nauseous and didnt feel well After the first two weeks it put me in the bed because I was so fatigued Now I have a prescription that cost over that I cant use because I cant handle Viberzi After the Viberzi I was craving sugar and so I got some hard candies My IBS got better and I thought it might be because it created a lot of saliva which helped with digestion Therefore I got some digestive enzymes with Amylase which is the enzyme in saliva and now I am eating all sorts of foods with absolutely no problems except maybe some burping
1538,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42788,14,months with viberzi and I am really happy I just feel bad sometimes when I eat too much junk food but is nothing compared to before For me is very helpful no side effects at all just the first days
1539,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42787,27,I have been taking mg bid for over a year now I have never been so normal feeling in my gut I do have some bad days with it just depends on what I eat I get stuck gas sometimes and have to really push and typically take a phazyme to relieve it I dont get any adverse reactions Its a pain in the butt at the pharmacy but well worth it I have had crohns for years now had major bowel resection surgeries and lost my ileum Every BM was watery and explosive and very very painful After a few weeks of taking it I was happy but did not think it would work for long And this has seriously put me in remission and I have average BMs a day that are semisolid versus my old average at or more per day Changed my life
1540,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42786,8,Has already turned my life completely around

1543,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42775,20,I have suffered from IBSD for years I used to be able to manage it by not eating triggers and occasional Imodium The last six months it had gotten so much worse I couldnt eat without running to bathroom within minutes Going out to eat was horrible I barely could make it home It started causing major anxiety because a few times a almost didnt make it The spasms would last all day I could hardly eat anything I would have to take to Imodium if I was going to go out to keep the diarrhea away I was living on it After normal testing the doctor put me on Viberzi It has been a miracle drug It has given me my life back
1545,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42771,22,This medicine has literally given me my life back It stops the diarrhea and I do not have the constant urge to have to use the bathroom anymore I recommend it to anyone suffering from ibs d
1546,Daliresp,COPD,7,42947,3,Daliresp did cause me nausea and diarrhea but Doctor prescribed Zofran for the nausea and Zofran causes constipation Problem solved
1548,Daliresp,COPD,10,42786,24,I have severe COPD I cannot walk around I was coughing up lungers daily but for last years with this I have had maybe or times Life saver
1549,Daliresp,COPD,4,42751,9,Breathing great diarrhea not so great Not worth it
1550,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,6,42668,15,I just started taking Daliresp again the only problem that I have is I cant sleepI cant go to sleep or stay asleepand when I do go to sleep its only for a few hrsthan I am awake againI take it before and stop taking it because I could sleepI really dont know at this time if it works or nothavent been on it long enough to knowthats one of the side effectsso what can u do to stay asleep
1553,Daliresp,COPD,10,42618,27,This drug has worked wonders for me Its too bad we cant afford it
1554,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,2,42603,19,Started taking Dailresp mths ago Noticed improvement in breathing in st week Then started having nausea and loss of appetite I also started having other reactionsinsomnia depression anxiety panic attacks bad thoughts about death Over the last mths its gotten worse I didnt know it could be the Dailresp This morning I woke up at am couldnt go back to sleep because of thoughts of dying Its pm Im still awakeI cant sleep during the day Got so bad I went to the ER today The Doctor told me to stop the Dailresp OK I never had mental health issues before I dont have any clue how long it will take to recover from the mental health issues Im having
1555,Daliresp,COPD,8,42568,37,I have been on this medication for approximately one month When I first began taking this medication mcg and was having numerous side effects Changed regimen to taking mcg every other day Continued to have same side effects For past two weeks I have been taking onehalf dosage mcg once at night and once in the morning This has virtually eliminated all the previous side effects My breathing improvement has been much better and more consistent with this low dosage The mcg pills are so small that is is impossible to divide a tablet without a good pill cutter I found one on Amazon that works great Perfect split of mcg pill each time
1557,Daliresp,COPD,3,42456,31,Have been on Dalisrep over weeks now could tell much improvement in my breathing Didnt need to use supplemental oxygen at all However yesterday I couldnt take the nausea vomiting tremors leg aches headaches bathroom trips any longer I tried taking the meds with and without food didnt seem to make any difference Im wondering how long the side effects last It seems some people dont have side effects at all I am so disappointed that I wont be able to continue this drug as I feel that it was helping me with my breathing But I cant stand the side effects any longer I have lost lbs in the weeks I have no appetite whatsoever and I know that I need the nutrition as prednisone causes bone loss
1559,Daliresp,COPD,10,42162,51,I used to have exacerbations regularly after finishing a dose of prednisone Began taking Daliresp a year and a half ago and have not had one since The only side effects I had was a weeks worth of very loose bowel movements when I first began A great medicine
1560,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,10,41887,23,I seem to have lost my tasting abilities for foods
1561,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,2,41853,32,Love what this does to improve my breathing but the diarrhea just wont go away and that is the worst side effect for me I tried taking in the morning and got headaches and felt nauseous as well as having the diarrhea so took it at night but the diarrhea has persisted If I cant take something to counter this side effect I will stop taking as I cant go anywhere with the diarrhea
1562,Daliresp,COPD,8,41837,49,Made huge difference in breathing and lessened exacerbations
1564,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,10,41689,57,Been on Daliresp since September no adverse side effects at all I find that it has helped my breathing greatly Have not had and exacerbation since going on medication Prior to Daliresp had to flare ups yearly
1565,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,9,41572,52,My wife has been taking this medicine for weeks for COPD maintenance It worked great for the COPD she use to cough constantly and had a hard time breathing even while on prednisone However within hours of taking the Daliresp she stopped coughing amp began breathing well However she developed diarea then after coming off the prednisone got severe back pain and was not able to sleep It seems to help the COPD very well but the side effects may not be worth the breathing relief
1566,Daliresp,COPD,10,41563,78,Medicine took water weight of lb immediately and another lb in the next weeks Helped my breathing almost immediately Was nauseous for months however I took med at night to sleep through nausea Have used for yrs and no more side effects Does help keep swelling to a minimum in entire body
1567,Daliresp,COPD,10,41547,76,I started with a sample from my doctor After using daliresp I didnt notice any change in my breathingafter only days I realized I didnt use my nebulizer as much I cant believe this little pill could help so muchBravo Only problem I wont be able to get another prescription due to the high co pay what a shame I do recommend this medication highly
1568,Daliresp,COPD Maintenance,2,41529,36,Did improve wheezing symptoms when taken in conjunction with Advair Diskus however caused sleep problems as well as digestive disturbances bowel motionsday
1569,Daliresp,COPD,10,41471,72,Prior to taking Daliresp had to take inhalers everyday always before exercising occasionally just to breathe normally frequent lung infections per year Felt like I had a lung infection once again when the doctor prescribed this med instead of the typical antibiotics and prednisoneAfter taking Daliresp felt much better in a few days no longer need to take inhalers only x in last days and exercising jogging and weights almost everyday Big improvementOnly downside occasional headaches maybe times per week that go away after a couple advilsOverall big improvement in quality of life
1570,Daliresp,COPD,10,41389,54,I started it days ago I felt better on the nd day
1571,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42666,22,I can not tell you how wonderful this medicine has been for me I have suffered from IBS for probably years now I am able to have a normal life free of spastic bowel movements every time I would eat never able to sit thru a movie NOW I AM FREE
1572,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42666,21,Started viberzi mg x daily for IBSD since I dont have a gallbladder Was great for first days and then diarrhea kicked in x daily Early this morning had severe abdominal pain with sweating and weakness Pain was so bad I thought I was having a heart attack and almost called Made myself vomit and felt better after that MD said if it happens again I will have to come off the Viberzi
1574,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42661,19,From day of taking Viberzi I felt a difference No more stomach pains or cramps or needing to run to the bathroom every time I ate this medicine truly is perfect Ive noticed that other people have had issues with it and I see a few have mentioned that they dont have a gallbladder and it works fine for them I do not have a gallbladder and it has been the most helpful medicine Ive been on yet so maybe it has something to do with not having a gallbladder Anyways this medicine does work for me and hopefully anyone reading this that has wanted to try it will take the good comments into consideration and try it out You never know unless you try Just read the directions and DO NOT drink alcohol like it says
1577,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7,42643,14,Female over here I have had IBSD for about years since I had my gallbladder removed Ive only been taking Viberzi for a couple of days so far and while I started getting abdominal cramps day two theyre not awful and something I hope will not get worse but Im having maybe bms a day and not running to the toilet every time food touches my lips Its such a relief to not have bathroom issues every time I eat anything Im praying this keeps working and the cramps go awayl with time
1578,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42641,13,I have been dealing with IBSD since I was about years old I am now The uncontrollable cramping and diarrhea gave me no quality of life I wouldnt leave my house or do anything What kind of life is that for a young adult Back in December my doctor told me about viberzi This has been a GOD SEND medicine I have my life back The second week I started taking it though I woke up in excruciating pain I went to the ER and I had a spasm of the sphincter of oddi I stopped viberzi for a few days then went on the mg and I take it once a day I FINALLY can live a normal life and not worry every seconds about where the bathroom is
1579,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42634,15,I have been on this medicine for a almost weeks and I finally have my life back The only thing I am noticing is I cant eat as much which is a good thing I also have some itching on my arms but not sure if its from the Viberzi
1583,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42621,24,First taking this drug I was skeptical because of the reviews where not assuring but I tried it anyways because I had no where else to turn with the discomfort of IBS I have been taking this medication for months and it has done wonders worst part for me was starting the medication which gave stomachs cramping and fatigue tho only lasted a couple days during the second month I experienced constipation which was very new to me so I followed up with the doctor He insisted for me to take only once a day instead of twice and I have had complete relief of the constipation in as little as three days I do not have a gallbladder and this medication Works for me
1585,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42618,12,I hv suffered with IBSD for about years Finally in July I had had it I was starting to avoid activities or road trips as I was terrified of having an accident Many times I did My dr prescribed Viberzi and right off I had a reaction so I cut it down to one pill a day It was a dream come true I felt normal days ago my diarrhea was back so I kicked it up to pills a day Im hoping the drug will continue to work for me I was at my wits end
1588,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42610,17,I got viberzi and took pills a day mgI took them for weeks and had to stop I couldnt have a bowel movementI woke up one Sunday morning at am and my stomache felt like a volcano Finally I had a bowel movement and it felt like I lost pounds It didnt work for me because you cannot go that long without a bowel movement I Got this medicine for IBS and diarrheaIt stopped the diarrhea and stopped all bowel movementI literally thought I was going to die because my stomache was hurting so bad I was hoping this medicine would work but it didnt
1589,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42601,8,Unfortunately this medication did absolutely nothing to help me I spent days in misery just waiting for it to quotkick inquot Went back to Imodium MultiSymptom amp MUCH better already Hope somebody else has better luck with this drug Luckily my doc had a ton of samples so I didnt have to pay for it
1591,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42598,12,I have had IBSD for years and was diagnosed with anal cancer years ago and treated with radiation and chemotherapy Ive tried all kinds of natural supplements antifunglals and meds with only Immodium giving me some freedom but stopping the pain Ive been on Viberzi for weeks and had normal BMs for the first week but the med doesnt seem to be quotholdingquot like it did before Im experiencing bloating and two loose stools a day now I will probably go back to adding some Immodium Ive also been experiencing some racing heartbeats and will contact my gastro
1592,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42594,20,Ive been on Viberzi for a little over a month now and its been fantastic My only problem is each morning when I take it i always feel like my arms way pounds so I lay down for a little while until that passes but then Im good to go for the rest of the day Ill take a little discomfort in my muscles for a day of not having to worry about pooping my pants
1595,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42589,27,Viberzi has changed my lifeI take it for IBS and I am very grateful for this medicine I have been on it about months now I was the first person my Gastro doctor perscribed it to If I forget to take a dose I will know because my symptoms come right back and I take my pill and Im fine again I do not forget to take it very often My insurance does not cover the medicine but I have a discount card and I only pay a month co pay The original price is way to high It is over one thousand dollars I could never afford that monthly
1597,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42767,15,I took it for about weeks and one night I woke up around am with severe pain that radiated to my back with heavy puking and the pooping Went to the hospital and they told me I had Pancreatitis and took me off viberzi Spent days in the hospital with IV Fluids and no eating Horrible experience
1598,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3,42765,13,Worked great for the first months then nothing Went right back to same misery I have dealt with for years Doctor even increased dosage even though people without a gallbladder are not supposed to take the higher dosage The higher dosage actually made things worse for me and the cramps last even longer than they normally do which is pretty bad so since it was no longer working I stop taking it It did seem like a miracle drug at first but unfortunately Im one of the people that it no longer works for after three or four months
1599,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42764,16,This is definitely been a miracle drug for me Im finally regular I take one mg tablet before bed because it makes me sleepy Occasionally Ill take one if my stomach starts cramping up Makes you feel heavy sometimes I used to take sleeping medicine cuz I couldnt sleep from the pain Two birds one stone Best thing my doctor has recommended Ask for a free sampleits worth a try
1603,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42751,21,Ive been taking this medication for two months now At first I was taking the full dose but I never had a BM so I lowered to mg once a day I havent had an IBSD attack since Ive taken it I still have my A flare ups sometimes but its really been a lifesaver The downside is that my BMs have now gone to every th day and when I do go its in very small amounts is painful and I usually end up having to skip a few days of viberzi to get it all out The medicine definitely works For me it works too well Im going to do a follow up with my doctor I dont want to give up this medicine but I dont think its healthy to be constipated all the time either
1605,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42745,17,Dealt with IBSD for over years Imodium helped but still had anxiety about going anywhere Started taking Virbezi about weeks ago Having very good resultsexcept for fatigue and major gas I could resurrect the Hindenburg Finally got Blue Cross to pay for it really expensive After reading some of these reviews I am hoping that I am one of the lucky ones and it continues to work I have a life again
1606,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42738,25,started this medication about two months ago hard to get BC to pay for it but after I did it was a life saver after suffering from IBSD for years and having a particularly rough flare up over months after one week I was NORMAL I feel so much better now I know it might not work for everyone but it did for me I dont have a gallbladder and only take one per day
1607,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42723,0,Not covered by insurance
1608,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42718,28,I have been taking Viberzi mg for about months I do not have a gallbladder and almost years ago I had a bowel blockage I have had diarrhea at least x a week with high anxiety for travelling At first I took this medicine for weeks mg x a day and didnt have a BM for days so I went off of it for a few days then tried again same result and very bad stomach pain With problems continuing I found many reviews being too constipating so I started taking pill every morning WITH FOOD Since I adjusted the dose over months ago it has worked great I now have a REGULAR BM almost everyday sometimes x a day I have had diarrhea x in the last months this has helped me get back to living amp work It helped me
1610,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42716,26,Suffered from IBSD and anxiety for years Recently had a month bout of terrible IBSD Became a hermit Didnt want to leave the house had huge panic attacks about traveling and became very depressed Finally went to doctor Had problems filing this med with health Alliance but BCBS covered it Started taking a day each mg and caused opposite problem Now on a day and this is a game changer Its taken awhile to build up in my system but in weeks Ive only had attacks and I was having daily If this stays the course its seriously heaven sent Slowly getting my life back
1612,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42712,16,This drug has worked tremendously for me I take it x a day with food and it has almost ended my rushing to the bathroom I can go about my life without always knowing where the bathroom is It has some bloating and gas side effects but it cut my IBSD down to shreds I use to go times a day and now I have a much more normal schedule Cannot praise this drug enough
1615,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42704,9,Viberzi works well controlling diarrhea of IBS almost too well I have days of passing minimal stool and a constant bloated feeling Since I have only been on this med for two weeks I am hoping my body regulates in time
1616,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42700,18,Viberzi was given to me for ibs and I took pills and ended up in the hospital for a week I honestly thought this drug was going to kill me I had severe pain in my chest and could not take in a full breath The hospital doctors said my pancreas was swelled really bad and putting pressure on my lungs and it was because I had used viberzi
1619,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42669,22,yrs DX of IBSD Collagenous Colitis Chrohns total colectomy wJpouch I have tried every Rx known amp nothing could stop the BMs incontinence nausea GI cramping and rectal spasms from surgery I found Viberzi read pt reviews Allergan Pharm documentation I was on mg x daily Similar symptoms the first few days by the rd day major decrease in stool frequency and gut motility Then towards my th day it abruptly quit working I became severely ill nausea vomitingheadache GI had me stop taking Viberzi vomiting amp D in bed a week GI did blood work and Lipase levels at next week Creatine Lipase still very ill amp no answers my headache off of it for days FDA fasttracked this be careful
1620,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42669,19,I have been on Viberzi mg for about months now I have seen my diarrhea decrease dramatically I also no longer suffer from the upper abdominal pain that used to trouble me almost daily As with some others here I have noticed a kind of sleepy muscle ache feeling about an hour after each dose and a tendency to constipation which I counteract by using fiber supplements Overall this has made my life much better and allowed me to eat foods I could not eat before My insurance has covered the costs
1621,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42579,21,IBS D for over yr tried everything but nothing worked Took Viberzi and immediately my D was gone Life was so much better For those of us who suffer with IBSD it was a miracle I felt normal and healthy first time since the is No side effects at all Unfortunately after months is stop working like some other users noticed the symptoms slowly started to come back First the gas then the diarrhea It has been mo since I started to take it I am about better than I was before Viberzi ndash I guess I will take it and pray that it will not get worst but it is a little disappointment
1623,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42576,18,Took this drug days on the th day I became ill Pain in the abdominal area felt like I was having a heart attack or severe indigestion The pain was terrible for an hour Took a tramadol to ease the pain Entire body felt weak and achy After a few hours I was able to get out of bed and continue my day but felt like I had been run over by a truck I do not have a gallbladder and the bowel movements while not watery while on viberzi was scant and I had terrible gas and gas pains Off the med today IBSD is back The watery bile in BMs is back Ill take that over the bad pains and feeling bad
1624,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42569,14,I was giving the drug last Wednesday and started it Thursday morning Things were fine that day I woke up Friday morning in lot of muscle pain thought it from my sleep I took my morning pill and went through my day feeling very sorry my abdomen started getting tighter all day I was feel sick and couldnt even eat dinner The rest of the night I was in oain vomiting and never had a bowel movement that daythis is the fourth day and have diarrhea and very little appetite I of course did not continue the medicine after Friday morning
1625,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42566,16,Viberzi is working great for me All medications can have adverse side effects as well as the potential to lose some effectiveness over time if taken frequently For these reasons as well as taking care of my body in general I try to stick to the low fodmap diet designed for IBS as those are the foods my body can pricess well I do not have to take a pill every day Only on days when I splurge on something I know has the potential to make me sick or if I find myself in a situation where I dont have any low fodmap food options I dont use the medication as a crutch to start eating anything and everything I want
1627,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42559,11,I have taken viberzi for only about one week The drug works very well at controlling IBSD for the first week although my gastro doctor suggested that I continue to take dicyclomine at the same time The side affects are that it makes you very tired and gives you additional nausea as if IBS did not have enough nausea all on its own If you are over years of age and on medicare this drug might be a quotteaserquot in that it works fairly well but the drug cost is not covered by medicare or most other supplementary plans The drug is waaaaaay overpriced When looking at drug discount coupons the best cost that I got is per month The cost of the drug is not worth the benefits when other drug will provide some diarrhea relief
1629,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8,42556,15,Have been taking Viberzi for a month now for IBSD and I cant be happier I have ZERO side effects Thank you for making me normal again
1630,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42552,17,Added Viberzi to mg of Wellbutrin Out of the gate Viberzi worked very well But the positive results started declining after about days After months Im not sure its working at all
1631,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42550,24,I have IBSD Ive tried with different drugs Xifaxan included but anything helps me too muchDuring the first month of taking Viberzi mg my symptoms changed dramatically in a good way I started being able to eat different food included some of the ones that I used to avoid chocolate burgers etc just felt bloated and had more gasBut I have to say that after the first month the effect is declining and now th month is helping a littleSo better than in the past but not as helpfull as it was at the beginingDoes anyone felling the same about the declining effect
1633,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42531,20,Ive struggled with IBSD for the last years and nothing has helped until I tried Viberzi Viberzi allows me to enjoy my day without running to the bathroom constantly This medicine is a life saver I saw results within the first couple of days
1634,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42531,28,I have had IBS D for years but controlled with immodium and bentylThree years ago it was uncontrollableCould not leave the house Stool cultures colonoscopy blood work xrays and scans due to pain all negative Immodium didnt workDoctor termed as unspecified colitis and IBS D Now taking lomotil hyoscyamine donnatol and cholestyramineThis makes life bearableTried xifaxin and did nothingNow got the mg viberzi x daily Took one pill with food yesterday morning Within minutes my legs turned to rubber heart was racing cold sweat and difficulty breathing The heart racing and breathing went away within half hour but the rubber legs lasted about five hrsSevere abdominal pain gasmetal taste til last nite No more
1635,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42521,32,This product needs to come off the market I landed in the hospital for days with severe Acute Pancreatitis Renal Failure Liver Hepatitis Oddi spasm etc I am female I dont drink or do rec drugs After taking this my liver amp pancreatitis enzy where over x the normI had L stabbing pain within mins of taking Viberzi for the first time I thought I was dying I could barely breath amp I buckled over in pain I took antiacid thinking it might help but it didnt amp with time the pain transformed to my mid back my entire GI felt like it was on fire amp if My belly got touched it would bring me to tears a fever started a few hours laterI have had a MUCH milder pain belly reaction to VicodineOxi but never like this
1636,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42517,23,Ive had IBSD for over years Ive had many embarrassing moments over the years and the disease has limited my lifestyle most of the time Immodium helps but not always I finally got the point where I could not deal with this anymore there are things I want to do that I cant because Ive always got to be near a bathroom I finally got a referral to a digestive health clinic to get this figured out After many tests and conversations with the doc we settled on some diet changes and this new drug Viberzi Ive only taken the drug for a few days but I am already seeing great results I hope they continue for a long time Im not having the urgency I had before Im down to one BM a day now and feeling much better
1637,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42514,28,I have been taking Viberzi for a couple months now Prednisone was the only thing that was able to control my Lymphocytic colitis I am now on Viberzi in addition to Imuran and it has been working tremendously No more diarrhea I can eat most food I wasnt able to eat before I found myself sick with a bug last week which resulted in diarrhea I took my nighttime Viberzi dose and had no more diarrhea after that I saw some of the reviews here and wanted to give my opinion and share how well its worked for me
1638,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42506,31,Well Ive had IBS issues for almost years now My prior Doctor put me on some other meds that helped with the have Diarrhea and stomach pain like nervousuneaseanxious I have no reasons for these feeling at the bottom of my stomach But the currents help but I still have those feeling and Ive kinda learned to live with them I heard about this new Drug and ask my doctor to let me try it and being on Viberzi mg two times a day Now for days those feeling are like gone and no side effects I cannot believe it my BM are close to normal food does not go straight thru me and those anxious feeling have disappeared It has REALLY helped thus far May
1639,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42500,29,I took doses and was rushed to ER this morning with chest pain They treated me as if I was having a heart attack I am admitted and tests are being run Everything is pointing to this new drug I took Also had dry mouth and confusion Could hardly speak
1640,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42495,27,I had diarhea from my IBS and Took doses of mg over a period of a week and had a severe case of pain due to sphincter oddi The pain was so severe in chest back and abdomen and radiated down right arm Also severe confusion and fainting prior to pain onset The pain was immediate with no warning I was transported by EMS to the ER I was given trial packages that did not include side effects It did stop the diarrhea but the side effects were not worth it
1641,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3,42494,17,Have suffered from IBSD for approximately years The only medication that gives me relief from my symptoms has been Imodium tabs per day I tried Viberzi for just three days because my symptoms became so frequent from not using the Imodium that I wasnt able to leave the house for more than an hour or two I hope Viberzi works better for other people who try it Very disappointing for me to say the least I gave it three out of ten because it did firm up the first BM of the day and had no noticeable side effects
1642,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42491,23,Found this new drug on the internet had to beg my doctor to let me try it since he had never heard of it With what I was seeing online I thought this may be the drug to give me my life back Nope it didnt work for me it actually made me feel like a had to go more I didnt have any side effects other than that I was on the mg dose x a day I have had IBS D for over years and have taken a lot of Imodium to control my symptoms and maybe that had something to do with this drug not working for me But its great that they are trying to come up with new treatments maybe the next one will work for meI can only hope
1644,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42477,43,this medication was a miracle in my life but it cost so much I will have to continue to struggle with not eating outside the view of a restroom its a shame that the drug companies charge such a high price for something that truly changes your life when your on fixed income you cant pay a month for a medicine no matter how good it is
1645,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42472,30,Ive been on this med for about a month now I dont think Ive gone this long without an attack since I was pregnant My IBSD went away with both pregnancies weird I know This drug has been amazing The only side effect I have is constipation I take a stool softener right now because I keep forgetting to buy fiber pills and nausea if I dont take it with food directions tell you to so thats on me Give it a try Remember a lot of insurance companies wont cover it yet because its new but they have a savings plan you can sign up for Take advantage of it
1646,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7,42469,44,I have battled stomach issues for years now Im only No doctor has found the problem in the past Ive tried many different medications every diet known and still received no relief I was in the bathroom with diarrhea times a day and that was on a good day My doctor prescribed Viberzi x a day I took my my first pill in the morning and by the evening my diarrhea had completely went away However I do have side effects gas and bloating the feeling of being loopy dry mouth loss of appetite and now constipation Im trying some stool softener to see if itll help but Im going to keep experimenting until I find something that works Its been extremely nice not having to run to the bathroom times a day though
1650,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,42455,22,I had microscopic colititsSevere abdominal pain a couple hours after taking med Dried out mucosa of mouth so much could hardly talk Also dried out eyes so much took a day of using artificial tear drops every two hours to make eyes comfortable
1652,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5,42448,31,I have struggled with IBSD for years Ive been in every medication available including antidepressants bentyl loperimide lotronex colestramine and many others The Viberzi seems to control the diarrhea but I am experiencing debilitating gas Especially in the mornings but it lasts throughout the day Its not just inconvenient its painful and uncontrollable I want this medicine to be the one I just dont know how to combat the gas I am also having abdominal pain but will stay the course to see if these subside
1653,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3,42446,19,I have taken both the mg and the mg Viberzi When I started on this medication mg it worked somewhat My diarrhea was slowed and the stool more solid However after being on it for a month or a little longer the benefits decreased I went from having to bowel movements a day to having or more Usual pattern was first movement was the most solid the next ones were more loose and runny My doctor increased the strength of Viberzi to the mg Same basic issuesworked good at first but after using for a while I was back to having or more movements with the first one the most solid I am again trying the lower dose as the cost of the mg was way too expensive even with Medicare and my supplement drug plan
1654,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6,42435,23,Started this medication today after being on bentyl for years Noticed within a few hours I was having side effects Muscle pains nausea loss of appetite Hopefully these subside and this medicine works My insurance covered most of the cost so pricing wasnt too awful
1655,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42410,52,I have been struggling with stomach issues for several years now and have gone through lots of bloodwork colonoscopies stool samples different diets you name it Turns out I have IBSD and also battle anxiety on a daily basis which makes it worse My symptoms include cramping urgency severe diarrhea upwards to x a day and sometimes rectal bleeding Im often late for work because Im stuck in the bathroom or afraid to leave the house I started taking mg twice a day of Viberzi and its been absolutely amazing I am currently days diarrhea free with very minimal cramping Hoping it stays this way forever I tried Xifaxan back in November and that did nothing for me Its an expensive medicine but its worth it for me
1657,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,43047,0,I had a UTI and It helped with my pain but only brought on terrible back pain it hurt so bad I couldnt breath or move it was worse than the uti pain Lets just say after one day they are in the trash and I embrace uti pain worse product ever
1659,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,42955,2,I took it while at work It never calmed my pain I plan on going to get some AZO
1662,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,42672,7,I was in pain one might so i drove to kroger at in the morning bought this because it said it had more strength than azo so I took them as soon as i walked out the store drive home sat in my car for an hour to still be in pain These pills do not work i drove back to kroger got the azo brand and was in relief within mins dont waist your money on this brand
1664,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42585,25,I had to come home early from work thought I needed the ER Called my sis and she said to try Uricalm first SOOOO glad I took her advice I went from fetal position with nausea and pain to almost complete relief in less than an hour LESS THAN AN HOUR Ive never written a review for anything in my life but this was beyond amazing that I couldnt help but pass this along to fellow hurting mamas Im still cranberrying and antibioticing it up but my symptoms have totally subsided From tears to cheers Im in total disbelief Hahaha I sound like an infomercial but I promise Im real good luck
1665,Uricalm,Dysuria,1,42536,4,Did absolutely nothing to help with the burning or pain Just made me queasy and turned my pee highlighter orange Total waste of
1666,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42463,14,I was experiencing early symptoms of a UTI I felt like I had to go to the bathroom even after I had just been and it was very uncomfortable feeling I wouldnt say it burned like UTIs usually do it just felt like I had to go really bad I got an at home UTI test strip and sure enough I had it I got the URICALM at my local CVS store in hopes it would give me some kind of relief I drank a oz of cranberry juice and three water bottles with tablets in hours and that night I felt better I was worried I would have to go to the doctor and get on antibiotics but with URICALM that wasnt the case Very affordable It comes in a pack and it only took to help me I would recommend this especially if you are catching it early
1667,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42411,16,I got a UTI on the last day of my vacation with hours of plane rides to get through On my way to the airport I stopped at the drugstore for some recommended Azo I saw Uricalm Max and decided to give it a try since it was on sale Best Decision Ever I went from nearly crying sitting with nothing coming out yet feeling like I was going to pee myself whenever I stood up to feeling completely normal When I got home I went home and saw a doctor I was prescribed the usual antibiotics and urinary analgesic Uricalm Max works much better and for longer than the medication from the pharmacy same price AND I can get uricalm over the counter to help until I can see a doctor for antibiotics
1669,Uricalm,Dysuria,9,42230,15,IT works like a charm I took two pills last night and I was able to sleep without discomfort I really recommend I bought the Uricalm MAX
1671,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,42157,16,This OTC medicine was the first to make me stop feeling any pain at all One day I had to pull over during my commute to use the restroom at a Parkway rest stop I commute over miles to work every day and have never had to stop By AM I was aware I had a UTI On my way home I purchased this product with no idea what it could do but my doctor couldnt see me for three more days Within minutes the constant pain was gone
1672,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,41972,17,Works very quickly Prefer this over any other brand
1673,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,41368,53,Ive had urinary tract infections since I was little My mom always bought these numbing pills and they worked like a charm Im having one at the moment and my mom bought Uricalm Works within minutes for me and totally takes away the pain These things work for hours and hours And the higher the dosage the better it works Total life saver if your having any bladder problems
1674,Uricalm,Dysuria,10,41199,34,It worked a couple minutes after taking it I was relieved

1709,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42876,2,Ive had menstrual migraines since my late teens I also have an aspirin allergy so my pain relief was going to urgent care amp getting phenergan shots with codeine The pain didnt stop it just allowed me to sleep Then a fellow migraine sufferer told me about zomig Its a miracle I take mg as soon as I feel the quotmigraine feelingquot and lay down in a dark room hours later I take another Im good for hours I can function Go to work Run my house etc I then take one more since my migraines are anywhere from days This is the first medicine that actually wipes my migraine out amp not just dulls it My side affects are dry mouth fatigue foggy head tingling feet amp legs But heyId take those any day over a migraine
1710,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42875,2,Been taking Zomig for about a year for common migraines without aura I think I never know if a serious migraine is coming on but Zomig seems to work for it all I break the mg pill in half at first if its not bad then take a whole mg pill if I wake up to a headache the next day My headaches used to last days switching sides Imetrex seemed to work but it made my arms and chest feel heavy Zomig has less side effects and seems to work just as well I do have a few side effects but I associate them with relief so they dont really bother me A pill will put me out and Ill sleep really well my skin gets sensitive to temperature showers will sting a little and as soon as the headache subsides Ill feel a little euphoric
1711,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42873,1,Have had migraines for decades and tried imitrex before but didnt help I get minor relief from Bayers Back amp Body aspirincaffeine pill Recently asked my doc about trying a different triptan and he suggested zolmitriptan since imitrex didnt help Next migraine I took Bayer and the mg zolmitriptan pill with gatorade Two hours later my migraine was decreasing instead of increasing but was still in pain so I took the other of the mg pill and was surprised to see my migraine decrease until it was gone and I was able to sleep through the night without migrainain pain Now I take the entire mg at once with bayer and gatorade once I notice symptoms and it decreases my migraines from hrs of hell to around tolerable hours
1712,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42870,2,An amazing drug ZomitriptanIt clears my headache in minsI realise how much I need this drug having suffered with Migraine for a hr period I am doing a tour of the world at age yrs old I ran out of this drug in Australia Had to pay over one hundred dollars to see a Dr and pay for two tabs on prescription I get six tabs a month on a free prescription in Scotland Missing home
1713,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42856,2,Maxalt did nothing and oral sumatriptan stopped working so I tried Zomig spray I followed the directions exactly and still got a ton of product dripping down the back of my throat which is normal Either my migraine kept getting worse of the Zomig made it worse Either way this did not work for me
1715,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42809,3,I Suffered with dreadful Migraine ever since I was around years old so bad my arm used to be paralysed and speech was severely affected with almost stroke like symptoms I had so much time off school and also my places of employment in later life and I had to cancel shows trips out etcAt the age of I was prescribed Zomig and it changed my life I only need a quarter of a tablet and after minutes I feel fine and the only side effect is a slight sensitivity to hot drinks and hot water which wears off after an hour or so I cant believe all those years I have suffered and the way Migraine ruled my life I am years old this year and whilst I feel happy to be curedI feel I have been robbed of many years
1716,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42802,3,The nasal spray is amazing pills no where as good Insurance wants you to try the pill first The spray is a miracle
1718,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42761,2,I have been having migraines since I was very young and now I found I couldnt travel anywhere and couldnt go out in the sun Ive have been taking zomig for years and usually it just stops my migraine straight away must admit it has given me my life back But yesterday while I was driving a long distance it came on quick And zomig didnt work as well I think I took it to late when I finaly got home in agony all the side afects started I felt realy ill my throat closed and pain shot around my neck and back Hopefully this wont happen again
1719,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42746,4,I havent found any medication that helps with my migraines Zomig caused me to experience a heat flash which lasted about an hour Onset of neck stiffness not as bad as prior triptan medications used but still limited activities Stinging and increased sensitivity in nose mouth and throat similar to sinus pressure Semipainful Glands sensitive to taste and makes everything quotsourquot reaction Liquid felt in nose and mouth for an hour or so Bad aftertaste and dizzyness Had to lay down and take a nap and side effects were still felt hours later
1720,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42726,8,I had severe migraines with the heavy intense pain and vomiting for about years Tried everything Somethings worked after a few hours but that is a long time if you are in extreme pain and vomiting My nureologist gave me samples of Zomeg and mg The mg completely takes the migraines away within a half hour I dont have any side effects with this This is the first migraine medicine that I can take and actually eventually finish my day It is expensive but if your doctor takes the time to explain everything else you have tried and this seems to be the only option usually your insurance will cover it then This has give me life back and I dont fear so much about migraines as I used to
1721,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42720,7,I began experiencing migraines in my early teens By early s I had tried almost every medicine made without relief My migraines are hormone related and predictable For days during my menstrual cycle and another days during ovulation Without any relief I would end up in emergency room miss work and honestly feel like I wanted to die I couldnt move I would throw up and nothing would help I would literally be in bed in a dark room without moving for days every weeks All I have to say is Thank God for zomig It was life changing Within to minutes of taking zomig I could resume my normal activities as if the debilitating migraine never existed
1722,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42694,2,This drug has changed my life My migraines used to leave me in pain for days along with vomiting sensitivity to light etc the nasal spray works within half hour and usually provides full relief I cant even believe it migraine gone Leaves me w a sore throat but i dont mind it First couple of times it made me sleepy but i got used to it Zomig allows me to move on with my life instead of living my life in pain If you are debating definitely give this a try

1725,Salonpas Pain Patch,Osteoarthritis,2,43004,0,I used the patch and because I thought it was helping reduce the pain of my tendonitis of my wrists I continued using it The pain of neither wrist got worse and my palm hurt and also the fingers A week ago after using Salonpas pain patch for over three months my wrists have swollen and the pain is excruciating I went back too my doctor but because he was not aware that I had used the patch for a long time he thought the swelling of the wrists were due to rheumatoid arthritis The swelling is going down gradually I would like to add here that I am allergic to aspirin and ibuprofen I read the label only yesterday
1727,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,3,42995,0,Ive used salon pas for years I have boxes of them in my car or at home Even at work But these new patches arent good at all I put it on and almost immediately them crinkle up and lift up It really sucks because I like salon pas better than the other pain relieving patches I guess Ill have to try something different Something thatll stay on at least I hope you all bring back the old patches or figure out a different types because these really suck
1728,Salonpas Pain Patch,Osteoarthritis,10,42974,2,I have tried heat pads freeze pads gels tablets and I am really pleased I saw these advertised on the TV I tried them and I had no expectations at all I was very surprised that they worked on my neck pain my hip pain back pain and have no complaints worth giving a go may not be suitable for everyone but worked for me
1729,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,5,42959,0,I too have used these patches for year the white ones They would stay on for hours and hours Now the new beige thin ones wont stay on at all Used one on my wrist fell off after min of constant pushing it down in place Use a new one after thatlasted less than min They have lost a good customer with this quoton the cheapquot adhesive

1731,Salonpas Pain Patch,Osteoarthritis,1,42931,0,I tried this for my pain from a disc spinal fusion and I might as well have spread melted chocolate for all the good these things do I tried the box of patches ingredients camphor wintergreen and methyl salicylate Dont waste your money All you do is walk around reeking of camphor and wintergreen and it has almost NO effect as far as pain The ads for this are very deceiving Id rate this product with a minus if I had the option
1734,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,5,42800,1,I used of the Salonpas with Lidocaine patches for muscle pain in my shoulder and neck area Started getting a rash after the second application The rash is in the shape of the patch very itchy and bumpy and looks like it could blister
1735,Salonpas Pain Patch,Muscle Pain,10,42438,9,Got my free sample of salonpas pain patch the same day I worked straight hours I work in a Vets office in the kennel and most days we do to dog baths a day I was exhausted and sore and I just knew I would be sore and unable to move the next day but I applied solonpas pain patch before bed and woke up ready to face another day I would recommend this to everyone and I will be purchasing more Thank you for the free sample it really works

1739,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42573,6,Experienced bad adverse effect with tablets No problem with nasal spray
1741,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42546,3,Normally my migraines take a few hours to go from the inkling Im getting one to full blown vomiting and feeling like my body is turning inside out with chills and sweating etc After taking this at the inkling stage within mins I was throwing up and it had become a full blown migraine It clearly ramped it up
1742,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42532,0,This medication has pretty much saved my sanity Got diagnosed with migraine years ago after having one so bad doctor thought I was having a stroke Started off getting migraines at or a month but am now up to in a day period so am being investigated for triggers etc but zolmitriptan has been amazing every time Guess Im the lucky one not getting side effects per se but I already suffer from CFSME so wouldnt notice extra fatigue anyway I get this on a UK prescription at tablets each time so maybe poundUK per month
1743,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42504,12,This has been a life changer I get bad migraines a month that last usually over a day or two and it would make me completely non functional The great thing is that this medicine works fast and completely takes away the splitting pain The side effects the first two times were sleepiness and a pretty sore throat and face but since then theyve been extremely mild and almost unnoticable Please try it its worth it
1744,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,4,42504,2,I have had migraines since my s and took zomig last night for the first time only to wake up like I had RA My joints to both hands were in so much pain I could hardly get dress or hold a purse Additionally my hips were in pain I do not reccommend this drug to anyone I know migraines can be debilitating but taking zomig to maybe cause RA or any type of an autoimmune disease is definitely not worth it I never write any reviews but I found others should be aware of side effects
1745,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,42494,0,After suffering years of migraines and using IMIGRAN which did not work for me finally decided to use the nasal spray for migraines Really works well when it wants to but sometimes if the migraine is really bad it wont do anything I get bad side effects such as a swollen tounge and really sore and sensitive mouth but would rather that than a migraine so is good overall
1747,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,42420,7,I have been taking zomig for a couple of years It definitely takes my migraines away but my skin and muscle hurt every time I have to plan showering around it Today I had a very bad reaction after going on a very brisk mile walk My face and skin were flush nauseous and hyper sensitivity to light Migraine came back w a vengeance Felt somewhat like heat stroke which isnt possible as its degrees Almost went to hospital Iced my head and rested Finally feeling better Note to self Do not exert myself on this medication
1750,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42313,4,This is the only medicine for migraine that actually works for me The only side effect I have noticed is skin sensitivity to hotwarm water
1751,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,42301,2,Usually works well but this time Im on my th day of a Migraine Ive had migraines the since I was Now My biggest problem is I have Fibromyalgia all day when I have to take it especially more than one time in a hour period I can hardly move My Body is sensitive to EVERYTHING Water Pressure touch even pressure from laying in bed or sitting in chair It is excruciating I go from a constant daily pain level of an to a It usually lasts about days after I stop taking it But ZomigRelpaxImitrexMidrinall of them do it I think it is all Triptan MedsI cant get rid of this for nothing and am violently vomiting and my Body hurts so so bad that I dont know what to do
1753,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42228,1,I have suffered from chronic Migrain since I was about years old I am now and have been using zolmitriptan for a little over years This prescription has changed my life for the better My migraines controlled my life I could never make plans to do anything because I wasnt sure If I was going to get a migrain attack or not and with my luck times out of I did The first time I look zolmitriptan I was going on my day of a horrible migrain as soon as I swallowed the disolving pill my migrain was goneI find that I get better results in releaving a migrain if I take the pill right when I feel one comingSome side effects for me isfatigue frequent urination hunger and naeousia but well worth the side effects in my opinion
1754,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,42222,1,i find this medication works wanders only downside is hypersensitive to Luke warm water feels like Im standing under boiling water but I find within minuets my migraines are gone with some drowsiness
1755,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42216,0,I find this medicine Sandoz Zomitriptan mg ODT to help allot with the stopping of coming migraine The only thing is I have trouble with is the fact that I cant tell weather or not its going to be a migraine I take it anyways Causes some drowsiness
1758,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,42152,5,First time taking the spray amp its horrible It made me vomit made my migraine worse my nose feels weird amp hurts amp I want to fall asleep Horrible
1761,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42096,7,Zomig is a miracle for me The only drawback is my insurance only will pay for tablets a month and sometimes I need more
1762,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,42072,1,Lifelong migraine sufferer This medicine is the best thing for killing a migraine Whether I take it as soon as one starts or try to suffer through it for a day or so using over the counter meds I know once I take a Zomig I will have relief with a half hour I am extremely thankful this medicine exists
1763,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,42063,8,I have had migraines since the age of Now and still get them I have been taking Zomig for the past years and they are the only tablet that have helped me At first the dosage was mg and was bought down to mg as the side effects made me feel as though my arms and chest were really heavy and was accompanied by a very dry mouth and was not able to drink anything hot Sometimes I get very tired the day before the migraine hits and I know its time for a Zomig I still get these sensations but not all of the time I pay every month tablets expensive but it works My only worry now is that after the age of it is not advisable to take them I wonder what am I going to do
1766,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,41923,6,I get relief from Zomig I cant drink hot drinks like coffee or tea though unless I have lots of milk in it If I take a shower the water hurts my skin unless I have the temperature very low I dont know why Zomig gives a sensitivity to hot water amp hot drinks It does clear the headaches I get tired though
1767,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,2,41774,4,The side effects far outweighed the benefits Before I ever noticed that a migraine had begun to subside I was overwhelmed with the most awful tingling sensation It literally felt like I had a full body rash and as though something was crawling on me mixed with the tingly sensation when your foot falls asleep I also got very weak and nauseous and occasionally light headed It was dreadful I finally decided it was easier to take my regular migraine meds and treat the actual migraine symptoms than to deal with the side effects of Zomig The only reason Im giving it a is because it did slightly lessen the actual migraine
1768,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,41758,11,Ive used Zomig for around years now if taken as soon as recognise an attack I know that about mins later the pain in head will go longer if its into the attack I have always experienced drowsiness and hyper sensitivity all over my skin if I were to have a shower within hours of taking Zomig my whole body feels like its stinging hot drinks feel like they are burning my throat hand washing with hot or warm water is a no no Also if I eat within hours it will feel like my taste buds have exploded excruciating but brief pain I also still get all the other migraine symptoms stomach upset fatigue very irritable even with the Zomig but I guess I can function with those things its the head pain and sickness thats worst
1769,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,41724,21,Zomig gets rid of my migraine but it knocks me out I take one dose and then sleep for hours Afterward the headache is gone but my joints ache and my muscles are very tender to the touch
1770,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41690,13,I have recently gone to a headache specialist after thinking no one is going to help me with my migraines and constant tension headaches She gave me Zomig and it does really work The first time I tried it I wasnt sure my headache was a migraine since it felt different then the one Ive always experienced It wasnt throbbing from front to back all on one side but it did really hurt bad all on one side I was pleasantly surprised Maybe it was a different kind of migraine since I have just weaned off of Excedrin and years of Tramadol use A couple of days ago I had a bothersome headache that had been off and on in intensity for days then turned into the normal migraine I have been accustomed to and the Zomig took care of it
1771,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41625,29,This is the first medicine that actually ALWAYS gets rid of my migraine with minimal side effects Its like a miracle as far as Im concerned
1772,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,41600,6,Wonder pill as far as Im concerned I worry in case I run out or horror of horrors they stop making it The pain and other migraine symptoms seem to switch off in less than an hour after taking it and side effects of soresensitive throat are not bothersome I used to have or more a month lasting days and nothing would make me comfortable
1773,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41584,17,This medicine has changed my life and allowed me to have a semi normal routine even with multiple migraine attacks through the month It almost always works for me within an hour and though it is very expensive it is well worth it It is the only medicine I have taken that has helped me
1774,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41454,21,I have been a migraine sufferer for over years and several of the quottriptansquot have proved to be effective as Ive found out as my insurance has dictated but Zomig continues to be my go to remedy Over years ago I found that if I took a triptan and lit a cigarette my heart would race That was probably a very good thing as the choice between getting rid of the migraines or getting rid of the cigarettes became easy Zomig allows me to function even when I wake up with a full blown migraine I count on it
1775,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,41419,6,Zomig is effective though I occasionally require a second dose After taking Zomig I experience stiffness and achiness throughout my body Warm water feels very hot on my hands and if I drink tea it has to be barely warm or it feels like it is burning my mouth Sometimes after several days of migraines treated with Zomig I am so sore all over that I have trouble walking or doing anything physical I have fibromyalgia and it seems like Zomig makes it worse more painful
1776,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41391,9,Zomig has been a miracle for me I had debilitating migraines for twenty years and had given up on finding anything that would help me In a new doctor prescribed Zomig and I have never had another debilitating migraine When I have health insurance its great Without insurance outrageously expensive per month But I am scared to try a different medicine even though my insurance pushes for the change
1778,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41307,12,I started getting migraines in the military The clinic doctor did not know what they were and was just given a bunch of pain pills that only lowered the pain a little I suffered for many years downing anything I could get About years later I got insurance and saw a neurologist and diagnosed them as migraines and gave me a script for Zomig It worked GREAT Then within a year the company folded and I was out of insurance again When I found out about the VA they started giving me Zomig amp got my migraines under control again amp started to work on my other problems
1779,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41180,14,Works wonders every time The first time I tried Zomig my limbs felt kinda noodly but that only happened the first timenever again It worked so fast I could feel the pain dissolving within minutes It tasted sweet and dissolved very quickly with no yucky aftertaste I have even taken just one half of the g tablet hard to do cause its so little and fragilewhile at work because I was concerned about side effects The half dose still knocked out the migraine and no side effects
1781,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41052,12,I LOVE Zomig I was bedridden for days almost every month for years from horrible migraines I thought I had tried everything to no avail including Imitrex and many others and then went to a new neurologist to ask for Botox based on another doctors suggestion He gave me samples of medicines I had never tried The st one didnt work cant recall what it was and the nd was Zomig Bingo Finally something that worked even after the headache has set in So expensive though very minimal coverage by insurance
1782,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,41026,5,Zomig ZMT works well for me so far years on it after Maxalt seemed to be less effective I begin vomiting and nothing can help me then so orally disintegrating tablets or a shot is all I can do My migraines always seemed to be hormonal but now that Im postmenopause I still get them Maybe fewer but just as severe without treatment Lifetime sufferer with family history father his brother his sister his mother his brothers daughter me all of my kids Having these migraine medicines work is like a miracle
1783,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,41025,1,Zomig gave me my life back Its the only medicine that has worked for my migraines and of the time gets rid of them I still occasionally have an all day throwing up migraine but normally thats if Ive woken up with a bad one Only side effects Ive noticed are in the last couple of years I tend to get a cold sore a couple of days after taking the tablets Asked the doctor but hed never heard of that before so I put it down to general low resistance Only problem is I tend to put off taking the tablets because I dont want the cold sores but general analgesics really have no effect and tend to cause stomach upsets
1784,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,40945,4,First reaction was all over tingling and pain Then my skin felt like something was crawling all over and I still have a headache I have had similar reactions to Maxalt and Imitrex
1788,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,40809,4,Zomig ZMT works well for me especially when I take it just as I get the feeling I will get a migraine All migraine symptoms are gone within minutes My side effects aredrowsiness but not so much that I cant function I just yawn a lot some neck stiffness taste sensitivity the first several bites of food after letting the tablet dissolve cause my tastebuds to feel really funny sort of a sharp feeling if that makes any sense at allBUT those symptoms are a lot better than having a migraine
1789,Zolmitriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,40794,11,I have suffered with quotcluster headachesquot for over years Finally I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with cluster headaches and migraine headaches years ago Cluster headaches would come in my case in March and October Whenever I would fall asleep at night I would awaken with horrible cluster headache This would happen for about weeks Zomig mist worked every time Unfortunately since August pattern has changed NOW every time I lay down or I could be sitting and BAM I feel the symptoms creeping up on me Yes the Zomig mist works like a charm and I have tried the dissolving tablets too the mist works faster Why so expensive Big problems with insurance coverage regarding quantity too Help me Astra Zeneca
1790,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40721,11,Out of the five or so migraine medicines Ive tried Zomig is easily the best The caveat being you have to take the pill at the onset as soon as you feel symptoms If you wait until the migraine is in full swing it takes much longer for it to work
1791,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40710,12,I have been taking Zomjg for Migraine for the past years I used to suffer for to days with migraine I was prescribed a lot of different medications with no success The first time I took Zomig it took my migraine away within to minutes It has just about always taken all my headaches away from then on Usually one dose tablet takes it away On occasion I have to take a second dose It has improved my quality of life greatly I rarely have side effects also
1792,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,40522,4,Zomig works wonders for me for migraines The only side effect I typically have is hearing my pulse in my right ear Annoying and weird but not a dealbreaker I take a high dose of Effexor and have no interactions that I know of However I once took it with Ambien and that was a big mistake as even the next day I felt offbalanced and weak I also try not to take it within hours of Tylenol for similar reasons Its nice to have a medicine that works so well so consistently
1794,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40504,11,This is the only medication that will work for my migraines My family doctor does fear I am taking too much A lot of things trigger my migraines but I will swear on this particular medication I have tried everything Unfortunately the cost is outrageous and the insurance companies do not like paying for it
1795,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,40489,6,I have tried a countless number of remedies and Zomig is the only thing that has worked for me I do have a couple of side effects to mention Sensitive skin pain to the touch tingling in my extremities achey joints and muscles and excessive urination Although these side effects dont happen everytime I use it Zomig has been a miracle for me I have suffered migraines for years I can live with the side effects and only hope my migraines will go away with menopause like the doctors have told me
1797,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40343,3,My migraines appear hormonal related premenopausal in my s If taken at onset Zomig is very effective against my migraines If taken later it is still effective but requires another dose within a few hours as directed to get the pain under control HOWEVER if taken then Ive had the stiff neck and jaw thing I do notice that my skin is sensitive to heat after Ive taken Zomig and my taste buds are sensitive to some flavors excessive salivating It does make me dizzy I usually break a tablet in half which I was just reading youre NOT supposed to do but it doesnt say why and if I catch the migraine fast enough half is usually enough to deter it I save the other half for later if the migraine feels like it is returning
1799,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7,40268,2,This product seemed to work really fast but sometimes it wouldnt take care of all the pain from the migraine Also I noticed when I do a hard body workout at the gym and if I get a migraine the next day or two after that workout the medicine made my body ache real bad My chest arms and legs would really hurt from the constricting blood vessels
1800,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,40162,6,I had migraines for years before I finally was sent to a neurologist He gave me a samples of many of the prescription migraine medications that are out there now and many of them including Imitrex just did not work or made me really fatigued Zomig worked really fast and I have no side effects at all If I can take it as soon as I can feel the headache coming on it is gone before I really realize it
1801,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,3,40141,7,I was given this to try for menstrual migraines I only get my migraines the first day of the last day of and sometimes halfway between periods While it did get rid of my migraine the pain got A LOT worse before it went away That was the one and only time I used this medication
1802,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,40133,7,I would just like to say it is very important to know what other medications you are taking with this medicine It can have very bad side effects I only took this medicine times when I had a very bad interaction It was before they made it known not to mix an antidepressant with it and it took years to find out what really had happened other than a drug interaction I was on Paxil at the time I wound up going to the hospital for them to tell me that everything was fine but it took about a week before I was feeling normal My heartbeat was very rapid I was delusional and uncoordinated It felt like my inside were burning from the inside out but yet I felt a constant chill I am not saying not to take this drug but be careful
1804,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,40060,5,Unfortunately after taking my first dose of Zomig I had an allergic reaction to it Upper lip felt like I was stung by a bee and started to swell up on one side This stayed in the same location for about minutes After that my left cheek started to swell and get numb along with my nose Off to the ER I had to go While it DID kick the migraine I had an unfortunate reaction to it
1805,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40024,12,Ive had migraines for about years They run in the family unfortunately Ive tried a lot of other stuff and also Imitrex Nothing helped at all with my bad headaches until I was given Zomig by my doctor Ive tried both the ZMT and the regular swallow tablets To me they are the miracle pill Just this morning I had a severe migraine one of the worst in a while I was ready to go to the ER it hurt so bad I took a Zomig and about minutes later I could feel the effects I took a nap and woke up without the migraine and was able to come to work today I still get drowsy during the day but it beats having the migraine ruin my life
1806,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,40012,5,I use the Zomig nasal spray Out of the or so migraine medicines Ive tried prescription this is the only one that works for me It doesnt take too long to kick in I use it then after minutes the pain starts to ease some and I go take a nap when I wake up its gone
1807,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,39993,2,Works well some sleepiness
1808,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9,39981,4,As far as I know Zomig is a swallowed tablet and ZomigZMT is the orally disintegrating tablet with a zingy orange flavor I didnt notice much difference but I imagine the ZMT works faster as it disperses in the mouth With this abortive as with many it works best if you take it during onset of migraine This is an issue for me because sometimes at onset Im not sure if it will actually develop into a migraine so I dont take it and then I am in agony two hours later even with two doses which are nothardly effective since Ive missed onset
1810,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10,39913,6,This has helped me in ways no other medicine has It is the best by far in my book It takes about minutes to take effect but completely takes my migraine away and I have my control of my life
1811,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1,39901,4,Does not work at all for me
1812,Zolmitriptan,Not Listed / Othe,10,39883,0,I have suffered from migraines since I was a young girl The migraines were absolutely debilitating to me Sick in bed nauseated and vomiting all day until I usually collapsed from exhaustion Zomig has been a miracle drug for me Within an hour the headache is typically gone Occasionally I have to take a second I occasionally feel sleepy and experience a little dry mouth but otherwise have had no side effects It is wonderful to have a remedy to restore my ability to function through the day versus trying to push through work totally debilitated by a migraine
1814,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8,39792,4,Except for what I would classify as bad heartburn the drug appears to be very effective
1820,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,9,42171,6,Used early right after flare up works pretty quickly
1821,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42061,17,doc gave me Rx for mg x daily to start i took pills and then more after an hour the first day then just pills daily for the next few days until pain and inflammation is gone this was also Rxed with indomethacin mg x daily along with a drug to coat the stomach x daily I would say my pain after only a few hours subsided from a to a and the next morning was at that is where i am right now i will try an update in a few days
1822,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42060,21,I had a severe gout attack on my left wrist the pain was so bad I thought I was going to pass out My Dr prescribed Colcrys mg times a day By the time I took the nd pill the swelling started to go down and I had enough mobility to perform my job operating a train
1823,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,42018,22,Ive had about to gout attacks over the past year and Im yrs old Overall healthy just like to have way to much fun and eat real good too That being said the gout attack Im suffering with now was a Beast Mode of an attack to my ankle and its lasted for nearly week At first doctor gave me prednisone steroid pack that did absolutely nothing to help Got a shot of cortisone in my back side which didnt help either since the gout is in my ankle in past direct cortisone shot to affected area would do wonders So I call the doctors office after my pain has not gone down and if anything its gone up Doctor gives me ColcryssaysquotSD affect diarrheaquot not on st daynd day for mebut its a miracle medicine Pain free
1825,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,41746,51,I like to say Colcrys is THE BEST I got the prescription barely yesterday and just about hrs later I was without pain on my ankles and my burning disappeared I was able to sleep After being unable to sleep for consecutive days Thanks to this wonderful medication I was able to sleep last night and able to workout As for side effects only soft stools but nothing extreme DEFINITELY I RATHER DEAL WITH SOFT STOOL THAN DEALING WITH ALL THAT BURNING AND PAIN ON MY FEET I truly regret not taking this medicine since yrs ago I just did not know I sadly have gout GLADLY NOW I FOUND COLCRYS
1827,Colchicine,Gout Acute,2,41551,20,I get about flare ups per year always in the side of my big toes Dr prescribed Colcrys mg I honestly dont get any relief that I can tell from this medication I take every hour for a max of pills over hours Seems like the ONLY relief I can get is by flushing my body with tons of water which can take days
1829,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,41462,30,Immediate relief No upset stomach no numbing of fingers just sweet relief I took at onset and eight hours later pain gone in about hours
1830,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,41430,17,Have been on Uloric for months Getting flare ups in knee which Doc says will go away in another month or so Colcrys has terrible side effects but gets the job done on the pain immediately Is a trade off I have to make for a while
1831,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,41419,13,after two days of severe pain and visit to doctor blood work and xray came up with problem never had any type of goutarthritis related problem before crystals were found on my wrist after two days of taking colcrys Wrist is still stiff and hurting but pain is bearable
1832,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,7,41338,8,had bouts in left big toe Second one was so bad couldnt use clutch in car or change geers on bike On a bad day I considered a chisel and malet but about a week after starting colchicine I woke to find pain reduced by and within about weeks so well pleased and no apparent symptoms
1833,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,41214,33,This medication worked for my first acute gout flare although I was prescribed a low dose twice a day because of its toxic property Later I discovered for first dose then an hour later then prophylactic use until flare up was under control The side effects where mainly bowl related It was probably a good idea to start with a low dose but did not get relief until I had to start the dose over with then
1834,Colchicine,Gout Acute,9,41160,28,My doctor put me on Indomethacin during a Gout attack She said that taking Colcrys during a flare up can dislodge uric acid crystals from other parts of the body which can end up in the affected area making it worse After days I am on Colcrys A little bit of upset stomach but I will trade it for the pain any day Manufacturer has printable coupons and voucher to help with the cost Good luck
1835,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,41085,8,I have had gout attacks in both knees elbows wrists big toes thumbs One of my doctors put me on mg of colchicine daily and that worked to control the goutNow the doctor that took over for her said I cant be on daily and now I have had gout in my right thumb and then my left thumb in weeks since I quit the daily dose
1836,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,9,40988,10,Pain and fatigue has been greatly reduced as compared to generic colchicine
1837,Colchicine,Pseudogout Prophylaxis,10,40913,7,Had excruciating leg and knee pain for weeks until finally diagnosed as pseudogout Colchicine did wonders and now virtually pain free Now the bad news Three doctors have said it will no longer be made available
1838,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,40904,3,No attacks while on this medication
1839,Colchicine,Gout Acute,2,40898,36,I have had gout attacks in the last months For my most recent attack and the worst Ive ever had I got virtually no relief from using Colcrys I took the first days of pills but no improvement I switched to Indocin and have had about relief overnight and getting better still The original colchicine was good and acted quickly but something is very different about Colcrys I wont take it again for gout attacks
1840,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,40860,31,Gout is so painful After first doses of Colcrys had immediate relief I had fallen on my knee and was being treated for osteoarthritis with no relief Went to arthritis doctor who told me it was gout in my knee Went on Colcyrs and I can walk again
1841,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,40827,23,I get several gout attacks a year Less side effects but also not as fast acting as Colchicine was Taking more Colcry over several days to obtain relief then when I was taking Colchicine
1842,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,43039,0,Colchicine was very effective when I was to yrs oldstops pain in hrs Now when I take it it causes diarrhoea
1844,Colchicine,Behcets Disease,10,43020,0,I was having severe outbreaks of rashes and canker sores for the last couple of years After months on it Ive only had two minor episodes both never erupted went away in hours
1846,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,42947,7,but my side effects from colchicine were terrible the doc had put me on x mg and then mg every hours hours later I had spontaneous diarrhoea and vomiting for hours unable to eat much and a terrible timeI wanted to warn everyone about the side effects New research says the most effective AND least toxic dose for colchicine is only tablets and then one hour after flare ups
1848,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,42929,6,Extremely prolonged first attack of gout Repeat visits to GP prescribed various drugs then colchicine Only day course Worked within a day Pure relief Side effects really sudden diarrhoea which lasted hours Benefits definitely outweigh side effects
1850,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,42743,8,Safe for weekly consumption One tablet mg per day
1851,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42688,8,Colcrys works for Gout flares Allopurinol barely gets half of Gout patients uric acid down to where they stop having flares Use Uloric mg to lower your Uric acid further than allopurinol could so you DONT have flares anymore because there will be less Uric acid in the body and therefore it wont be stuck in your joints hurting you Its free each month if your Dr writes days and you use the Uloric copay savings card
1852,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,42681,2,My year old takes it everyday and it works
1853,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42677,21,Hello everybody i have chronic gout and osteoarthritis had it for years and am going thru a bad gout attack today right ankle joint feels like somebody busted a empty bottle and broken glass inside my cartilage it is the most pain imagined not even mg hydrocodone helps this is my th or so attacks in my life lost count main cause for me was uric acid caused by drinking beer for many years i never learned yea i took just about everything from several meds indomethacindiflonecallopurinol curently and today colcrys x pills which will knock it out here in about few hours drink plenty water and yea diarrea to flush out comes with it i have cut out drinking for over weeks and just one six pack one day and Bammfull blown gout
1854,Colchicine,Gout Acute,5,42669,10,Best drug for gout is indomethacin if your stomach can handle itColcrys works for some people but it is basically useless for a lot of peopleI still use it because my rheumatologist pushes the issue despite the fact that I tell him its not doing a darn thing for me
1855,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42658,15,I have suffered with an acute gout attack for the first time and my doctor gave me Colcrys I am nearly pain free in less than hours I wish I hadnt waited so long to go to the doctor
1856,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,42649,0,Improvement started immediately after starting medication Complete return to normal function after months on medication Current dose mg daily Stomach issues which may have been from extensive antibiotic use prior to correct diagnosis were resolved with Culturelle Probiotic and recognizing lactose intolerance This drug did cause lactose intolerance
1857,Colchicine,Gout Acute,1,42643,18,Had a bad flare up of gout in my let foot Dr prescribed Colcrys and after three days I had no relief from the pain swelling or burning but I did have terrible nausea and diahrrea Doctor then switched me to Indomethacine and within hours the pain started to subside Now two days later Im about back to normal
1858,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42635,15,Have suffered gout attacks for years Taking the prescribed dosage resulted in diahorea after three days Now I take a single mcg tablet for one or two days at the first sign of an attack This proves effective with no side effects It also means I need to keep a supply of colchicine at hand
1860,Colchicine,Gout Acute,9,42497,13,have had gout attacks since back the heavy beer drinker Quit drinking in and gout attacks down now years old I occasionally get gout attack but I take allopurinol daily has been great but recently had some medium pain in joints son back on Colchicine daily feeling better gotta stay away from greasy meats shellfish but medication works great

1862,Colchicine,Gout Acute,1,42395,11,Had gout in wrist amp knee days on Naproxen hadnt shifted it Blood showed UR as normal so got sent to the emergency room After xrays amp more blood tests Dr decided it was gout amp prescribed days of colchine Apparently it works best at the start of an attack so might be wrongly prescribed My experience was both feet got gout with no easing of pain in other joints while taking it I got the well known side effect but the effect on the gout was worse than neutral
1863,Colchicine,amilial Mediterranean Feve,10,42392,3,it saved my life my quality of life before colchicine was very low now I can smile and look to the future only side effect is mild diarrea

1865,Colchicine,Gout Acute,1,42383,11,I have been having gout attacks for about years now My Dr prescribed allopurinol daily to help keep my uric acid levels down I was prescribed Colcrys as an antiinflammatory and I have to say it does absolutely nothing for the pain My wife who has never had a gout flair in her entire life believes Colcrys is a miracle drug So I take it just to humble her I wouldnt suggest this medication to anyone I wish I could give it negative stars as a review
1866,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10,42374,1,good
1868,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,10,40617,10,This is a great drug for gout flareups The problem is that the cost went from cents per pill to per pill
1869,Colchicine,Gout Acute,9,40172,44,Reduced initial pain extremely fast days later had mildly loose stools slightly crampy stomach
1870,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8,40121,16,I am subject to relatively frequent gout flare up every months or so At the first symptoms I take one mg of colchicine every three hours and most of the time after pills the pain is gone I also take pills of imodium to avoid the diarrheaIt works fine for me
1871,Colchicine,Behcets Disease,6,39990,7,Been using colchicine for over years No noticeable side effects but do get my bloods checked annually Only problem was when returned to using it after a two year break Some diarrhea at first but this stopped after a few weeks once body built up tolerance to drug
1872,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7,39971,20,This is a useful drug but care must be taken not to take too much when trying to get reliefThe maximum startup dose is usually greater than that needed to create problems in sensitive individuals or if taken with another incompatible drug I took x mg tablets for days recently for an attack of left toe gout whilst starting on Simvastatin for blood lipid lowering and ended up with severe diarrhea without any stomach pain This knocked back the gout attack also but cessation of therapy allowed it back with a vengeance and two very bad nights followedI have cleared the statin after days so will start low dose Colchicine again if needed tonight but keeping to mg max dose in future
1873,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,9,39719,4,Unusual medication but works fast and effectively totally removing gout symptoms

1918,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,42120,9,I have had problems with constipation since I had an intestinal surgery a few years back Recently I had kidney stones and the pain killers led to an obstruction Product seems to work pretty well But I feel I should point out for people saying they now use this product every day After reading the fine print and double checking with my doctor You should never use any laxatives daily unless your instructed to Your body can become dependent on the laxative and may not be able to have a normal movement on its own Even the PG says take days or less Hope everything works out for you all
1919,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,42039,77,It works I went to the er and I was told to take miralax and I am so glad I bought it is a good product I am so happy to be relieved
1920,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,42030,66,Until about years ago when I turned I very rarely had any problems with bowel movements Then I got a toe infection which required antibiotics to clear up It worked but after that I started having problems with constipation I tried more bran and fiber It did not work I tried eating more fruit and vegetables It didnt work It was getting so bad that I started get hemorrhoids that bled bright red blood when I wiped It was scary I had to strain and strain just to get to the bathroom I tried prunes and prune juice and when it did work it gave me the runs and lots of gas and cramping I tried magnesium and in order for it to work I had to take so much that it gave me the runs unexpectedly Miralax worked for me
1921,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,42018,87,I had a bowel obstruction from using lasix and not drinking enough water I was admitted for surgery scheduled the next morning But before the surgery I did use three small bottles under dr Supervision in hospital and my bowel obstruction miraculously untested Today four years later I am constipated from vicodin I used miralax todayAnd my pains went away and I was able to go
1922,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,9,42016,52,Ive been constipated for some time and I couldnt have a normal bowel movement and then a friend reccomended I try Miralax because they were hospitalized and having problems but I tried it the first day and I loved it so much that I do it once a day every day to once every couple of days I highly reccomend this to anyone who suffers with constipation And it also mixes in well with anything you want to drink so its tasteless and easy to drink
1923,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,42003,78,Ive been dealing with a chronic GI problem for about months It caused me to some times because unreliableloose when going to the bathroom So I went on the BRAT diet for a little too long and it got me backed up pretty bad I tried Dulcolax but it didnt do too much My doctor decided I try the last step and take a dose of Miralax I mixed it in a full bottle of juice and all the terrible pain and bloating I had went right away a couple hours later No cramping or anything just mild stomach growling This is a miracle
1924,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41956,104,A few years back I was hospitalized with a bowel obstruction Once I left the hospital my bowel movements have been irregular I couldnt make a movement in over weeks I was force to take stool softeners which never worked and Dulcalax laxatives which did worked but I became constipated after it wore off I went to the doctor and they suggest I try Miralax I gave it a try when day past it only gave me gas nd day past more gas On the rd day with Miralax I was able to have a bowel movement I was very happy because when I take Dulcolax I had cramps and had to have the toilet on standby all day Miralax was a painless soft stool which relieved pressure of constipation And I started having regular movements
1927,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41891,129,I have gastroperesis and rarely have a bowel movement on my own Ive gone weeks easily without a bowel movement Its to the point that when I do go on my own we know that I am severely constipated and that it HAS to come out Abdominal xrays continuously show Im backed up even after going Miralax is not a quotmiracle medicinequot for me It works but only after a few days time However considering that typical laxatives only cause me gas and bloating but no relief I cant really complain Magnesium citrate Linzess Reglan Amitiza have all failed me This is the only relief that I can ever get
1928,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41862,5,I have had trouble with constipation all my life I had taken Milk of Magnesia for a while and started getting pain with that so I talked to doctor she prescribed me MiraLAX I started MiraLAX and I havent had anymore problems since this product is amazing

1932,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41777,185,I have had very painful Irritable Bowel SyndromeConstipation for most of my life and have gone as long as three weeks without a bowel movement It hasnt responded to changes in diet exercise regimens or fiber supplements In fact the fiber made it much worse Other laxatives either dont work or wring me out for days My doctor prescribed Miralax in and I have taken it daily ever since with no problem I still dont go every day but when I do go the stool is soft and the motion is easy and painless I expect to take Miralax forever and have no problem doing so Its a beneficial versatile medication thats definitely worth a shot if youre battling constipation

1938,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,10,41527,55,I suffer from Syringomyelia This is a condition that severely effects your Nervous System The stools that my Digestive Process produces kind of changes from day to day Since I am already on a Whole Foods Diet without any Dairy or Wheat products sometimes Im Regular Other times my stool will either be too hard to get out and thus will stay stuck inside of me for a few days resulting in terrible gasbloating Other times my Stool will be completely liquid and yet because my Nervous System is not responding correctly I just cant flush it out of my Intestines Whenever my Bowels are not functioning correctly all I need is a small dose of Miralax in a Cup of Water and within minutes Im able to go no problem Highly recommended
1941,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41467,104,Ive had constipation problems for years It runs in my family About ten years ago I had to have major hemorrhoid surgery both internal and external and things have been going downhill since After having kidney stones and the doctor could not see them on Xrays because of impaction in my intestines my urologist suggested Miralax I had taken Ducolax two different types of laxatives but was made sick each time because both produced violent reactions but both worked well Miralax was the answer A miracle
1942,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,6,41395,57,I have taken Miralax since I was years old due to a medical condition The product does what it should but after about years it acquired a flavor that I cant stand I mix it with other drinks and over time it ruins those drinks for me also If you can get past the flavor it is a miracle product
1943,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,9,41354,8,Worked perfectly after drinking Liters oz every minutes liters the night before and liters the day of finishing hours before the procedure No side effects at all I suggest quotchasingquot with white cranberry juice This prevented any after taste and possible nausea Taste is the only reason I gave it a nine but it really wasnut bad when chilled Note that if you let the liquid get really cold you wonut be able to drink it fast
1944,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41347,15,I have been having serious issue with my bowels the past few months due to new medications narcotic I have increased fiber water intake exercise laxative use and NOTHING was working I hadnt had a Bowel Motion in weeks Finally I got so fed up with feeling so lousy I went to my primary She had prescribed me Miralax So when I got home I mixed myself a cup of apple juice and pour some Miralax in it hours later I was already starting the process for bowel elimination At first it was still very minimal and still felt completely full By morning time it was a completely different story This is absolutely AMAZING Ive never had a product work so fast and effectively even without cramps Im still mind boggled
1946,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41311,55,Ive been taking MiraLax as my mom tells me ever since I switched to formula Im not a good eater so Im always constipated However MiraLax works pretty much all the time It would get a except that it failed today I took my usual dosage and I was still constipated I guess its because Ive been taking it my entire life

1948,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41267,121,Miralax is great First day was the only time I experienced any side effects and that was only a headache After that Ive been taking it every day at night in a glass of water It doesnt taste like anything and dissolves quickly Works great too Ive always had constipation but recently I was having constant pain and bleeding with every bowel movement due to a fissure it was horrible But now that my doctor recommended Miralax to me I finally feel normal in that department
1950,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41174,119,I have used everything on the market even changing my diet more water and fiber and I was still struggling I saw Miralax at first I thought na just more bad tasting powder I decided to buy it what could I lose I am amazed I feel so much better an no nasty taste I put it in my coffee orange juice even soda So easy to use Thank you for making it over the counter now

1953,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41085,44,I havent use the bathroom like I supposed to in the last month I have taken Fleet and other laxatives but it just did not work I felt so bloated and I never stopped eating Finally I couldnt take it no more so I went the doctor and she prescribed me something to take The medicine that she prescribed for me wasnt covered by my insurance so I went to Walmart and saw that ClearLax had almost the same ingredients I bought me some apple juice and mixed it together About an hour later I really used the bathroom and I feel great If it works for me it is some good stuff and I am serious
1954,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,41045,124,I had been constipated for as long as I could remember I would have a bowel motion maybe once every weeks So not normal My diet consisted of high fiber oz of water a day fruits veggies but still no bowel motion I have tried cleansers laxatives and other products but nothing I recently began doing colonic irrigations because I was so frustrated My doc suggested I try Miralax The st day I took some in the morning and the nd day I took some more By that evening of the nd day I had a bowel motion I couldnt believe it After all this time it was Miralax that did the job Thanks Miralax I would recommend this to anyone
1956,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,41007,36,Works well for constipation due to Venlafaxine ER I take Miralax every night at bedtime in hot tea after typical day of drinking L water eating an extremely highfiber diet veg except for fish exclusively whole grains cook with extravirgin olive oil and some walking along with lots of tea both green and black The Miralax helps but still only movement per day versus prior to medication When I double the Miralax THEN things start to approach premedication regularity
1957,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,10,40981,109,I recently had a laparoscopic hysterectomy As some of you may know anesthesia from surgery can cause the bowels to basically just stop moving Add to this the trauma of surgery in a nearby region combined with taking narcotics and I was MISERABLE It took days for it to work but when it did it was a major miracle I did not realize constipation could be so bad youd consider that you might DIE Miralax not only works but it does not give you the horrible sick cramps you get with stimulant laxatives Just the best ever
1958,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40965,59,I am years old and was taking an antiinflammatory medicine as well as a prescription pain killer for my kidney stone that I have Those medicines made me constipated and while I was at Childrens ER my nurse practitioner prescribed me MiraLax I was skeptical and afraid that it would counteract with my other medications She assured me that it would be okay Did you know you dont have to take it just once a day I took doses at once with ounces of water and a couple of hours later I finally had a bowel movement Overall this medication is really phenomenal The only bad thing about it is that it causes gas and nausea Other than that Id say this is the best constipation reliever for all ages out there
1960,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40913,56,I had been struggling with constipation since I was from taking Tylenol s for pain and had tried every laxative imaginable I even tried colon hydrotherapy and that did nothing for me I am now and have been taking Miralax for the past month and I have never felt better It feels great to be regular again Prior to Miralax I was going once a week

1971,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,1,40849,40,With my family history of colon cancer and my bout with colon cancer Ive been getting a colonoscopy every years This past April I was told to use Miralax It was the first time my prep was not sufficient to proceed with the procedure even though I followed the instructions exactly
1972,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40776,37,I have been using Clearlax for months as I take many medications everyday that constipate me I have not had any problems and continue to take everyday with no problems
1973,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,6,40746,21,My constipation worries all started when I was taking cholesterol medicines a few months ago and could no longer tolerate side effects on top of the constipation had to stop taking them when I saw my doctor she told me to get some calcium citrate supplement with magnesium to release the constipation Well it only made things worse by giving me bloatinggas I believe that Miralax could possibly save me from all this misery but it just started taking its effect on the third day with some relief with this product but not quite as yet I have an appointment on the seventh day of this product to see if it will actually work out for my problem Also taking simethicone chews mg with Miralax for releasing the fullness gas bloat after meals
1974,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40725,65,I am years old and have had problems with bowel movements since Ive been potty trained Ive usually had one extreme to the other but going to the bathroom was never easy for me I finally went to see my doctor to see if there was anything we could do about this Throughout my childhood Ive been on different medications but nothing helped Now finding out Im lactose intolerant doesnt help either She prescribed me Miralax and I have to say when I use it correctly that is taking it everyday and drinking enough liquids with it it works wonders I no longer get stomach cramps or gas
1975,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation Acute,10,40707,142,I had been suffering from severe constipation that couldnt be cured even with laxatives for weeks until my doctor recommended Miralax I took it with no real progress for days but on the th day I finally started having normal bowel movements I did not experience any side effects whatsoever as you do with laxatives No diarrhea gas bloating sudden urgency etc I finally had complete relief Also I mixed Miralax with cranberry juice It had virtually no taste and dissolves completely I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from constipation
1977,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40645,104,This medication is heaven sent We suffer from bad constipation in my family We eat healthy and a very high fiber diet get plenty of exercise and drink lots of water and still get constipated Miralax is our solution for this problem it is even gentle enough for my kidsI do not recommend taking it daily because you could get very loose stools You could take it two days in a row to empty out and then switch to every other day or even every two days This works for me and I have really bad constipation
1979,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40611,2,As I aged my bowel motions became increasingly difficult The physicians I consulted recommended more water dietary fiber exercise etc but none had a lasting effect I tried synthetic glucose derivatives lots and lots of gas and cramps For me dietary fiber produced too much uncontrolled gas The osmotic agents produced too much water loss and I was warned about potential electrolyte imbalance Finally I tried PEG and Nirvana Its convenient tasteless dissolves in all liquids stable and for me no apparent side effects I discovered if I titrate the dose I control the nature of my bowel motion As an OTC product it seems to be one of those rare preparations that wont put me in the hospital
1981,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40544,69,My constipation caused a rectal fissure The tear would reopen every time I had a bowel movement Id been on various stool softeners and laxatives trying to heal the fissure but nothing worked until I started on Miralax Now the fissure is healed and I am pain free So very thankful Just wondering why I had to go to a colon specialist before I found out about this product Why didnt the other doctor I went to suggest this product
1982,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,8,40504,23,Well it works However I put it in water once and there was a bad taste and smell to it Maybe I hadnt mixed it well When I put it in water it was my first time I mixed it until it was clear but oh well It had a somewhat metallic taste reminded me of cauliflower I suggest taking it in like juice or soda

1985,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10,40256,87,I have constipation due to irritable bowel syndrome After using many other laxatives that helped for awhile Miralax Restoralax in Canada is the only one that has helped me have a regular bowel movement every morning without cramps gas and bloating Ive been using it for about weeks with no side effects I take Restoralax every midafternoon and drink lots of water all day
1986,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,40186,55,If you have trouble with chronic constipation Your using Konsyl and things are better bulk wise but still way to hard than Miralax is wonderful Keep adjusting the amount and you will be a much happier camper

1993,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,9,39983,143,After experiencing constipation for several days I woke up one morning with a physical problem that I was certain would require not only medical attention but also surgical removal Even though my doctor assured me I would be okay I was still skeptical He advised that I should take Miralax every hours until I have a quotcleansing bowel movementquot After my second dose I had success Now I take dose every other night I highly recommend this product
1998,Eslicarbazepine,Seizures,9,42648,5,I have stroke induced epilepsy Many of the medications controlled the seizures in the required dosages but the side effects on my stroke side frequently left me nearly nonfunctionalI was when my neurologist suggested Aptiom as an addon to Lactimal The combo still has side effects relating to aphasia and balance but with consistent effort I function really well Irsquove been taking Lactimal mgAptiom mg and am still seizurefree after monthsIm on Medicare think quotdoughnut holequot and do not qualify for additional assistance
1999,Eslicarbazepine,Seizures,1,42614,6,I was placed on this medication due to my epilepsy At first I didnt notice anything huge other than I was stuttering more and quotlosing wordsquot Then the intense dizziness and vertigo was hitting me every day Id randomly feel like I was under water and someone was spinning me Once I made sure my balance was ok I would have a very difficult time with my thought processes or communicating This would last a while after the dizzy incidents I was only on mg once a day After I spoke with my neurologist they stated that other patients on this medication have been reporting the same things I was removed from it immediately That was about a month and a half ago The dizzy spells STILL happen a couple times a week

2294,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,41717,82,Am yr old female have Type diabetes Was on metformin for years with good control then developed stomach problems nausea Have a new Endocrinologist and he recommended metformin ER and after two days I no longer experience the stomach upset Overall very happy with the medication
2295,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,41707,128,Since my last child years ago my body has been all out of whack piling on the weight late periods or none at all for months on end no matter how much I dieted and exercised the weight would not come off My doctor diagnosed me with depression at first and took bloods to find out I had polycystic ovarian syndrome I have been prescribed two mg doses a day of metformin and at first had quite a bad stomach upset for approximately the first weeks I am now rolling into my th week and feel great The weights slowly coming off and the side effects are non existent now Hoping to conceive a child soon if things go to plan
2296,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,41707,68,I have been taking mg Metformin ER once per day for weeks now Experienced barely any side effects about from a little nausea for days but nothing more after that for anyone experiencing nausea my gyno really emphasised to take it with a meal to stop you from feeling that way I feel great while taking it and have lost kilos already with moderate exercise I havent had a period in days But have been feeling some cramps the last few days so hopefully the metformin will begin to regulate my crazy cycles
2297,Metformin,min,9,41665,139,So far I have been on Glucophage for weeks for Insulin Resistance due to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome I had a little nausea and diarrhea the first two days By day three or four I had no more negative side effects It worked very quickly I quickly began to lose weight and started menstruating again My skin also began to clear up within the first week Glucophage helps so many of the terrible issues caused by PCOS I need more time to better evaluate the medicine but so far it is like a miracle If it is taken with food the side effects are negligible
2298,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,10,41658,107,I started taking this medication about months ago because Im prediabetic I had no side effects amp has worked great
2299,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,8,41580,79,Metformin they say makes you hyperfertile Yea I agree My hormones got a little wacky for a week or so Ive calmed down now and feel pretty good I take the dose up slow only one mg pill for seven days before adding one more mg for another seven and so forth until I reach four pills a day I noticed that without using any lantus that my blood sugar readings were lower Not low enough however to discontinue the lantus I noticed while on lantus alone I never felt all that chipper When I started the metformin my moods improved dramatically and I became a much happier person The diarrhea did not last long but did return when I increased the dose Getting used to the pils nowl and bowels returned to normal
2300,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,4,41563,80,I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome years ago My experience has been horrible Very irregular cycles Ranging from massive bloat extreme flow severe cramps night sweats and facial hair I maybe have periods every years Finally my doctor put me on Metformin The side effects for me are pretty bad Mainly stomach pain and diarrhea I work through it because I know my body will adjust Ive heard great things about this medicine and Im willing go through a little discomfort to improve my irregular cycle
2301,Metformin,emale Infertility,6,41538,30,I must be the small percentage who seems to suffer all side effects I have had the diarrhea sweats insomnia stomach pain weight loss and the list goes on Im on pills per day and have to find a way to work myself up to pills a day I suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis and am hoping this will help with that and my infertility
2302,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,41521,86,After months of taking the extended release metformin my cycle started and had being on point for the past months My acne has begun to clear and I feel better Now begins my diet and exercise to drop excess weight Unfortunately for my hair what has grown out will not go away but I was also given spironolactone to prevent any more from growing until then waxing and plucking will work Hope my review helped
2303,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,41485,74,It has been helpful with my sugar but I sweat most of time This may be a side effect and I am dizzy at times
2304,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,40959,23,Metformin started off good for me Except for the frequent diarrhea it worked quickly to give me a normal period I had no weight loss though I really need it and after months my periods became irregular again My doctor increased my dose after six months and again after Im still not regularly regular and it hasnt increased my ovulation per a daily ovulation test This medicine has generally great reviews but its very inconsistent for me
2307,Metformin,min,9,40935,65,It works very well and there are few side effects My blood sugar will get low but it does not drop like insulin can do I watch what I eat and maintain exercise and my numbers are always good I recommend this medication
2308,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,4,40885,51,I was put on metformin in April when I was diagnosed with diabetes First I was taking x mg once a day with evening meal Now December I am taking x mg twice daily The main side effect has been horrible diarrhea throughout So I am regularly taking Imodium to cope with it My AC has gone down So for me it is a toss up yes blood sugar has gone down but now I have to take diarrhea medicine plus use diaper rash ointment I would like to try something else so my butt could heal
2310,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40864,72,I have only been on Metformin days and I already see the difference in my symptoms I have more energy and already lost lbs Before it took me a year to lose lbs I have mild gastrointestinal discomfort but well worth it It seems to help with food cravings I used to drink cups of coffee in the morning and I am down to only one without any caffeine withdrawal symptoms I also dont crave sugar or high carb foods I have a healthy snack in between meals to prevent blood sugar drops such as an apple berries or carrots I would recommend this to anyone suffering from PCOS
2312,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40850,48,I was diagnosed with PCOS weeks ago and have been on Metformin ever since So far I havent lost any weight Luckily my condition was caught before I gained too much I only have about lbs to lose I am a registered dietitian and exercise daily so the not losing weight is a bit discouraging but my Endocrinologist has assured me that I will apparently with some people it can take up to months to start losing The side effects were horrible the first two weeks along with horrible cramping and a constant period for weeks However now I have no side effects at all you just have to stick with it My doctor was great and recommended taking the metformin at night so that I would be at home for the side effects I take mg daily
2313,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,7,40818,57,I have just been diagnosed with having Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Before the diagnosis I put on about lbs just out of the blue within months I also had excess hair on my face stomach and legs and I only had about periods in the last year I went for a pelvic scan and for the last days I have been taking Metformin mg twice a day under the doctors orders Something is definitely happening because I had a period within days of taking the medication and Ive lost about lbs in the last week The side effects were annoying I had a lot of gas and diarrhea for about days The side effects seem to have passed now My overall experience with Metformin is fairly good so far I am looking forward to seeing more results
2314,Metformin,min,10,40813,66,This medicine has definitely improved my quality of life Within the first weeks of starting metformin I lost pounds where before I struggled to lose weight Now I am in a healthy BMI for my height group I experienced no nausea while taking this medicine I took it in the middle of a meal I did experience some intestinal side effects gas diarrhea for the first week and the first week I increased my dose
2315,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,40810,45,The only issue with this medication for me was the stomach upset gas and diarrhea However the positives totally outweigh the negatives After months with no period and working out days a week with no weight loss it took weeks on mgday of metformin to have a period and lose lbs I noticed that the stomach upset is worst when I eat something heavy or fatty I continue to work out and am anxious to see where I will be a year from now
2316,Metformin,min,10,40794,83,Did failed IVF and months on this and got pregnant naturally
2318,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,7,40758,118,I have been taking this medication for years now It has lowered my insulin levels but they still arent normal I have lost pounds and my menstrual cycles has returned to normal I went almost a year without one at all I also have hypothyroidism and I think my positive results are from it I take two mg pills twice a day I have to eat with it or else I will get sick
2319,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,4,40728,24,I was on Avandamet for years but the weakness tiredness and especially the diarrhea came to be too much to bear If I wanted to go someplace I had to stop medicating I had to take one pill twice a day which resulted in bouts of diarrhea per pill My blood sugars were well within range and I have found nothing since to bring them down to that level but I refuse to be bound by side effects any longer
2321,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,1,40649,44,Im male and a Type diabetic now on insulin I have been a diabetic for years and took glipizide for eight of those years to successfully control my glucose levels When my PCP moved away I had to find a new one My new PCP switched me from glipizide to metformin As much as I tried to carefully titrate on to the medicine metformin left me feeling bloated and with chronic diarrhea My body simply would not tolerate metformin I ended up seeing an endocrinologist and he switched me to insulin and I am VERY happy with that move My glucose levels are under control and I dont have to deal with any adverse effects The penneedle injections hurt less than a finger prick so going on insulin has not been a problem at all
2322,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,3,40627,11,I have been diagnosed with PCOS for over years but only have been prescribed Metformin after seeing no results with combined pills Having gained so much weight over the past year now weighing kgs this medication does not seem to be working at all with my weight loss Im on x mg a day Have had few bad side effects nausea and bad breath I brush my teeth endlessly but doesnt seem to improve As long as I can lose weight I dont mind the side effects but Ive been on this medication for over a month now and I have not lost any weight
2323,Metformin,min,8,40607,36,After a few weeks of taking this my blood sugars came right down and have stayed low
2325,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40532,57,I was originally started on Metformin two years agowhen I first started I was supposed to take mg twice a day then gradually up to three times a day No matter when I took it I got horribly sick to where I missed work and could not even leave the house After stopping the metformin I tried other medications and things got worse After reading some reviews I started taking Metformin extended release I have been taking it for about three weeks and have had no stomach issues If you have a sensitive stomach I highly suggest asking about the extended release I take it at night with dinner and I am fine Hope this helps
2326,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,40487,22,I have had a hard time adjusting to it I have been taking it for about two months mg twice a day I am always tired and if I dont sleep enough I am sick all day I am hungry all day but almost everything nauseates me and I get discomfort pains in my lower stomach I usually can handle the pain and discomfort but since weve been trying to conceive for five years all the symptoms similar to pregnancy plays games with my mind Aside from all that I still plan to take the medicine for as long as it takes If anyone has the symptoms similar to mine please let me know anything you are doing to make it easier Thank you
2328,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,7,40445,6,Ive been on this for almost a month now Im exhausted all the time and whether I take it with food or not I get sick I am supposed to take pills a day I take the morning one about an hour after my workout and the night time one right before bed Ive noticed Im not nauseated when I wake up My period is due in days so well see if I get it No weight loss yet
2329,Clobex,Dermatitis,10,40093,23,Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis I was prescribed Clobex lotion for my condition that arises occasionally and causes itching and burning mostly on my arms Whenever I get a flareup I apply Clobex and get immediate relief
2330,Clobex,Psoriasis,5,40077,39,I have had psoriasis for years and have treated it with cortisone to control the inflammations and itching I discovered Clobex about a year ago and used it on my elbows and scalp It does a great job in eliminating the external signs of psoriasis when used for to weeks However after about a month the symptoms return I have used it a second and third time with the same results but I am hesitant to continue this process considering the warnings provided
2331,Clobex,Atopic Dermatitis,9,40060,40,I have tried really almost every corticosteroid medication on the market including topical triamcinolone and oral prednisone However this product is by far the most effective because it immediately reduces the swelling and inflammations caused by my skin disorder and disinfects the affected area It also doesnt cause the weight gain and mood swings of prednisone so its considerably safer and milderThe only unfortunate parts of this medication are that it can be quite greasy causing mild discomfort and can cause stinging when applied especially if the wound is new I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with their dermatological problem
2332,Clobex,Psoriasis,6,39891,116,I have had moderate and sometimes severe plaque and guttate psoriasis for years using clobetasol clobex for Clobex is the only thing that can eliminate my psoriasis almost completely It is a very effective drug but I feel I really should warn people of the devastating effects that can occur if the drug is applied continuously When using clobex or any other strong topical corticosteroid you are supposed to use it for no more than weeks then take a break I believe should be between and weeks I made the mistake of not doing that I used it continuously because I wanted to be clear Now my skin is paper thin Nearly every vein is visible and I break blood vessels constantly and I have stretch marks everywhere
2333,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,39631,40,I got psoriasis in March after a strep infection I probably had spots on my legs a few spots on my scalp and arms and chest but my legs were horrible My doctor gave me some samples of Clobex spray and after week my Psoriasis is gone He said I need to go in a mega tan bed for minutes and take IU of Vitamin D and take zinc so doing all that I am so thrilled with the results I would recommend Clobex to anyone pricey but so worth it
2334,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,39567,18,After a very bad breakout from a strep infection this was the only thing that stopped the itch After using this twice a day for a week along with UV treatments I started seeing my psoriasis clear up And the spray is so much easier to apply
2335,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,39526,33,AMAZINGWithin days I could see a difference in my skinThe plaques were starting to fadethe redness and itchiness GONEIt has been exactly one week since I started using the spray and I no longer have psoriasis
2338,Clobex,Psoriasis,9,43075,1,I used Clobex spray this summer for weeks in June This gave me almost immediate clear skin on my elbows This lasted until September long sleeve season Thanks Clobex I plan on using this every summer to give me clear skin during short sleeve weather Hopefully some day they find a permanent cure for this disease
2339,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42818,2,Clobex is in shampoo form I use that weekly Need tsp Lathers up really well I leave the shampoo on for a few hours then rinse This is a great maintenance first me between the spray applications I apply the spray on wet hairscalp so it stretches the product more bc its expensive
2341,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42538,9,Ive tried almost everything for psoriasis in the past It was an extremely embarrassing time in my life I was at the point that I was going to ask the doctor if he could just surgically remove the areas Then I tried clobex spray Within weeks it was completely gone Being a nurse Ive run across alot of patients that I have suggested them to try this spray They have all had success and come back to thank me I even tried it on my poison ivy and it worked wonders Thank you to the makers of Clobex You have changed my life Forever grateful
2342,Clobex,Eczema,10,42466,8,As most other users comment I call Clobex Spray my wonder drug at its worst my eczema results in the skin on my hands fingers covered in open weeping sores so that I have to wear cotton gloves constantly Clobex Spray clears this condition in or days But the main point of my review last time I bought Clobex it cost me a bottle this means I could rarely afford to use it I went to a different dermatologist he prescribed Clobex for supply through a specific mail order pharmacy the cost with no insurance coverage was I dont imagine I can name the pharmacy here but PLEASE if this stuff works for you get your dermatologist to do his job to find you a pharmacy where you can actually afford to buy it
2343,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42303,39,I would use clobex on my thick plaque psoriasis on my scalp It literally cleared it up completely within hrs to the point where I can go and get my hair cut The best med Ive used in my years of trying everything
2344,Clobex,Lichen Sclerosus,10,42302,15,Ive used Clobetasol Propinate for several years now I have to use the ointment the creme burns when I apply it But it heals the cracks and itching and bleeding I get from my outbreaks
2345,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42088,24,The spray is amazingonly thing that will clear my scalpRight now my scalp is in a mess because my insurance will not pay on it and it is for a oz bottleI cant afford that
2346,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,42025,38,Clobex for my skin I cant say enough good things about this spray I say quotsprayquot because the ointment did nothing The spray for some reason is absolutely amazing One place on my knee where the P wasnt removable with a jackhammer magically cleared up of the area in less than week My arms my chest EVERYTHING its gone My Psoriasis is gone Ive gone through shampoos NOW if I stop using the spray for a week or longer the symptoms return but until a cure is found for Psoriasis this medication is handsdown the absolute best there is
2348,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,41761,39,After about a year with this I went to see a doctor amp I was just diagnosed with pustular psoriasis palms of hands and bottom of feet only Before seeing a doctor I started juicing heavily lbs no thats not a typo of carrots in three weeks amp added green juices to my regimen as well My hands had completely cleared and my feet were almost completely clear But because of another issue I went to my doctor and because of the then upcoming tests I backed off of my juicing completely The psoriasis came back on my hands and feet While I wasnt juicing I figured I would find out what it was Doc gave me the Clobex spray For the immediate painful inflammation problems in my feet caused by the psoriasis this stuff is AWESOME
2351,Clobex,Psoriasis,10,41593,22,I love this stuff I actually use a different medication for my body called Stelara and I love that product as well But this is a good back up for special occasions when I want to let my hair down I spray several days before the event and I am almost clear I spray before bed and sleep with it in my hair and then around noonish I wash my hair Also dont wear nail polish while applying It will be like nail polish remover Great product
2352,Clobex,Dermatitis,10,41579,18,After just days of using this Im starting to see significant clearing on the inside of my elbow where a stress rash got out of control I might not need to even use it for the whole weeks and be able to save it for next time
2353,Clobex,Lichen Planus,10,41466,32,This is the only medication that worked after trying others for several months
2355,Clobex,Psoriasis,9,40997,30,Clobex is the only thing that worked Severe patches and redness went away in only days Its expensive and is a very strong medicine a little goes a long way
2356,Clobex,Psoriasis,8,40934,26,Had good redults form Clobex However after two years of using it my skin is starting to thin so I can not use it no more
2357,Clobex,Psoriasis,3,40463,43,I used Clobex this summer for itching and dry flakes in my scalp I became sick with a bad cold and later turned to pneumonia I was sick all summer long with trouble breathing and wheezing I went to an ENT and a lung doctor None of us could figure out what was causing the lung problem After several months I was getting better with the breathing problems Last week I used Clobex again because the itching scalp came back Two days later I am having breathing problems I put and together read the side effects of Clobex and breathing problems and wheezing are the first side effects listed All that suffering because I did not read the medical bulletins earlier
2361,Clobex,Atopic Dermatitis,10,40149,15,Works exceptionally well on body and scalp The only problem is it is outrageously expensive I had to go with the generic form
2362,Clobex,Psoriasis,9,40110,26,I had a severe case of psoriasis at the base and outer areas of my hair line with severe itching and the Clobex lotion cleared it up in a week I used a little on the affected area only
2363,Metformin,min,8,39793,141,This drug helped me control my eating habits and lowered my weight However I developed constipation
2364,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,39781,80,I have had PCOS all my life I am and had to have a full hysterectomy in May I was told by my male doctor that having a complete hysterectomy would relieve me of my PCOS symptoms It didnt Ladies we are still symptomatic of PCOS even with a full hysterectomy I have since found a female doctor who is a specialist with PCOS cases and has me on all the right hormone replacement therapy as well as the Metformin I take pills a day and it is helping tremendously I am losing weight and feeling better I do get a bit tired as I adjust to the higher dosing However I have never felt better in my life I would strongly advice seeing a female doctor for the PCOS issue at any age Women just understand women plain and simple
2365,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,39752,35,I have been having issues since I first got my period at years old Ive had horrible weight gain infertility and my cycles is never the same twice Ive been on Metformin for almost a month now and just had my first quotnormalquot cycle I had a bit of a problem with nausea when I first started taking this and Ive learned I have to eat right away when I get up from feeling sick but am getting used to it I definitely have to take this medicine with food or I get sick
2366,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,39752,39,For over years my doctor had no clue what was wrong with me So he just kept telling me to take birth control to regulate I was finally diagnosed with PCOS about years ago and was prescribed Metformin It has helped so much I did have a few side effects for about the first few weeks Nausea and tiredness mainly but it wasnt that bad I feel better and I have lost quite a bit of weight
2369,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,39708,17,I have recently began treatment for PCOS with metformin and i love the fact that I am now able to lose weight with medication and am watching what I eat I have not yet had any side effects I go back to the doctor soon to have more blood work hope it is working well
2372,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,39645,11,I was prescribed Metformin in combination with Clomid not sure if its working yet It has upset my stomach whether I take it with food or not Other than that I havent experienced any side effects
2373,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,7,39640,4,Ive taken this medication a couple times in my life and have had no adverse reactions
2374,Metformin,min,8,39614,76,Have been suffering for years before someone decided to treat me Glucophage plus a birth control has made life better
2375,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9,39569,50,I am taking metformin to control my PCOS It works really well The pill is medium sized and doesnt upset my stomach if I take it with food
2376,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,39541,143,i find this medicine to work pretty well throughout the day but not so much over night the down side is that it upsets my stomach a lot of the times
2377,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,39520,167,I have found this medicine for type to work extremely well I have had to use many other meds for my type diabetes and found myself on one heck of a roller coaster ride with high and low and no middle ground This particular med is great for me and it helps keep my appetite in control The apeptite issue is from another med that I will not mention
2378,Dalmane,Insomnia,9,42895,5,CORE Med for sleep This combo works for me amp Ive tried everything Dalmane mg Gabapentin mg amp mg Remeron VERY careful re Weight Gain Side Effect gained lbs in short order dramatically increases your appetite for Carbs amp Sugars amp overall appetite what they dont tell you is that they give this to patients in the hospital who wont eat to increase their appetite Dalmane can cause next day drowsiness but it disappears after a week or two
2379,Dalmane,Insomnia,1,42666,11,Yes dalmane is very effective at putting and keeping you asleep I was prescribed it for four years before the dangers were known By blocking neuron transmissions mine were not communicating next day I had a career that required thought concentration and problem solving I no longer could do any of that My professional domestic social and economic life fell apart insidiously over that time I became agoraphobic and withdrawn dependent on others who told me what to do Recovery of my own mind took well over five years many of them in a spin I had been made very very ill indeed
2380,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,42141,15,I have taken Dalmane mg since I had breast cancer in Worked great getting to sleep and staying asleep I continued using it since I had several surgeries in the past years This year I wanted to stop taking it I didnt know after weeks you are hooked on them they are that addictiveIt took me almost months to ween myself off them with my doctors help Dropping the dose and using Benadryl on that night until I wasnt using them anymore I would try another med if I never they were do had to stop
2381,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,42141,9,I have taken Dalmane mg since I had breast cancer in Worked great getting to sleep and staying asleep I continued using it since I had several surgeries in the past years This year I wanted to stop taking it I didnt know after weeks you are tooked on them they are that addictiveIt took me almost months to ween myself off them with my doctors help Dropping a night use every two weeks and using Benadryl on that night until I wasnt using them anymore I would try another med if I never they were do had to stop
2383,Dalmane,Insomnia,9,41484,54,Dalmane is a good medicine for insomnia because it works quickly and lasts a long time Due to its long half life it also gives anxiety relief for the next day I also notice I can go to bed easier the next night without taking another dose It does leave a metallic taste in the mouth and can build a tolerance but as long as you are careful it can give restorative sleep Also because it is so old this medicine is cheap for those of us paying with cash I wouldnt recommend it longterm because of the consequences involved with longterm benzodiazepine use but this is a sleeping pill that current manufacturers cant match
2384,Dalmane,Insomnia,8,40908,61,With all benzodiazepines you tend to build a tolerance which is why it is only recommended for short term insomnia treatment or to be taken as needed I do have to say that when used as needed this medicine hit me like a mac truck and I would sleep hours plus My anxiety and insomnia both much improved No hallucinations or late night grazing like with those so called quotnonaddictivequot quotnonnarcoticquot sleep aids Word of advice Make sure you take if you can sleep for at least hours and set multiple alarms
2386,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,40282,61,I had a hysterectomy and was suffering from no sleep at all My doctor gave me Ambien and it did work for the first few nights then sleepless nights returned A few days ago he gave me Dalmane and I couldnt be happier I am sleeping all night now However I do have a slight headache in the morning
2388,Dalmane,Insomnia,10,39949,123,I had chronic insomnia and the Doctor tried Ambien Lunesta and some other hypnotic which the name escapes me right now Those drugs for me anyway are worthless I would get up in morning and find a mess in kitchen I live alone and no memory of fixing food Furthermore began having terrible dreamsnightmares So Doctor tried me on Dalmane he said it has been on market for many years It worked great No hangover Slept hours straight for first time in months
2391,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,40350,33,I am and have suffered for about years from extreme tiredness acne around the mouth and chin and weight gain Was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in Started taking Metformin weeks ago and have had little side effects I am also taking spironolactone My biggest complaint is severe sudden cramping in the small muscles in the front of my legs and toes Taking calcium with magnesium seem to help I felt tired for several days but have lost lbs already Could also be from water weight My brain seems less foggy and I dont feel as depressedI do not eat sweets in general but this medication has affected my appetite in a good way
2392,Metformin,min,1,40260,51,I took this medicine for a very short while It began with serious nausea followed by vomiting a couple of weeks later I could not take this medicine
2393,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,40243,28,After one year on my medication I find it to cause serious fatigue if I have not eaten regularly Gas and bloating are on and off Minor weight reduction Initially it was a wonder drug with the usual gas and loose stool over time its positive effects are less noticeable unless I miss a dose
2394,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,40241,20,Taking metformin twice daily for nine days now st time user horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea first days but clearing up now sleeping hours every other day and feeling tired in evening not in morning Nauseous when eating anything in evening headaches in evening also Seeing drop in glucose readings of about points fasting at this time some weight loss probably from fluid loss and not eating much in evenings
2398,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,6,40170,29,I started to take Metformin two months ago after finally recieving proper treatment for PCOS and insulin resistance The first month was especially rough gas abdominal cramps and diarrhea were persistent It seemed my body was used to my blood sugar being high so if I didnt watch meal times I ended up having minor symptoms of hypoglycemia even though my blood sugar was normal finally On rough days I would take an Imodium with my metformin careful not to overtake it I stopped eating crap it made me sick and I found that if I took it an hour or two before or after meals instead of with the meal my GI side effects werent as bad Drink lots of water
2401,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,40126,108,I have been using Metformin for months to aggressively treat my prediabetic condition Together with a lowercarb mg per day calories I have lost pounds This is about double the weight loss rate I had on the diet alone The only side effect I have experienced is a loose stool once or twice a week Definitely a good tradeoff I am a year old female moderately active who has had a hysterectomy
2402,Metformin,min,10,40123,164,My experience with metformin has been awesome I have been using this medicine for about a year now and have has great results I know have regular periods which is great because I used to get it every days or miss months here and there Another fantastic thing is that I can now function when I am menstruating which used to be impossible for me due to the horrible pain I now have manageable pain and dont have to get shots for it Ive also been able to lose lbs that I had gained Overall Ive had a wonderful experience with this medication I believe that taking my doctors advice was the best thing I ever did I think the combination of the medicine changed eating habits and exercise all helped
2403,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,40122,26,I have been on metformin for about months and I take it to help me lose weight and I do see results but now I feel tired a lot but that is about all
2404,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,3,40114,21,Helped me with my blood sugar levels and I lost lbs in a month Down side horrible stomach pain nausea and diarrhea Doctor is changing my medicines
2405,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,5,40101,13,I am currently on Metformin for PCOS symptoms However blood test after blood test has shown that I do not have PCOS I have all the symptoms and Metformin is working to regulate my cycles The only downside is the weakness lightheadedness and sleepiness I am experiencing I have read that it is possibly from lactic acidosis which is frightening I am increasing my water intake and exercise and hoping that it will go away
2406,Metformin,min,2,40098,71,I was on this medication for about a year and I had horrible side effects
2407,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40085,15,I just got this medicine prescribed to me on Friday started taking it on Saturday no side effects yet but from reading the comments it seems to help with PCOS and regulating your periodgetting a biopsy in weeks to see if I am precancerous or have cancer so wish me luck
2408,Metformin,min,8,40081,14,The first week of taking Metformin Glucophage I was extremely sick But after that intail first week of taking the pill I was better I take mg in the morning and at night making that mg a day So far it hasnt given me any issues Havent noticed much weight loss but so far I am happy with it
2410,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,40048,21,Since I started to take this medicine my sugar level has been a lot easier to manage
2411,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,9,40044,32,Just diagnosed last week Taking mg x day Only side effect Ive had is increased anxiety after taking the morning dose Ive had sporadic anxiety episodes in the past but they appear to have increased
2412,Metformin,min,8,40037,55,My doctor recommend glucophage mg twice a day with breakfast and dinner With breakfast also take mg Glocotrol It made my sugar level while previously was as high as
2413,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,40027,30,I have been on it since I was diagnosed in May of Started with x mg and was increased to x mg in months No problems so far
2414,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40022,28,I used metformin for about months and only had nausea and heartburn after a greasy meal this made me change to the Metformin ER It did help me lose about pounds which is great because with PCOS it is hard to lose weight I only used this to lose some weight and make me ovulate which only took about weeks I do not have insulin resistance Overall this is a great drug for PCOS
2415,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,40017,50,I was prescribed this about two months ago for PCOS my doctor gave me the option to treat the symptoms or treat the root cause and I choose the latter She started me out on a low dose and worked up to a full dose which helped a lot with side effects I felt mildly nauseous all the time until I started focusing on really eating right If I eat a good healthy dinner right before I take the pills I dont feel sick at all Another side effect Ive lost all interest in alcohol because it makes me feel terrible immediately This has forced me to change my lifestyle but in a good way Ive lost some weight and just generally feel better
2417,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,40016,34,I was on Meformin for about a month mg twice a day I was told that it would give me stomach problems and loose stools but since I have irritable bowel syndrome that didnt worry me As it turns out this medicine had the opposite affect I had constipation all the time Only a good dose of laxatives would help but even then I had to strain pretty hard to relieve myself Finally my doctor decided to take me off the medication since my readings were in the mid s Ive been off for about two days and Im feeling very lightheaded Im hoping this will pass soon My readings are still good and the constipation is abating
2419,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,3,39998,49,I am a year old male I stopped taking this drug along with Glimepiride after only days because I was experiencing constant exhaustion and shortness of breath Walking up the steps caused me to pant and have to sit and rest I wanted to sleep all the time I never took a sugar reading during the days I was taking it so it may very well have worked to lower my sugar I just couldnt live with the side effects and felt better within hours of stopping taking it and Glimepiride I will go back to my doctor after the holiday to try something else
2421,Metformin,min,8,39972,8,Did not resolve polycystic ovarian syndrome completely but did improve quality of life by treating my subclinical insulin resistance Metformin extended release mgday
2422,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,8,39970,13,I have been taking Metformin for about a month and have not had any side effects I also take glyburide with it
2423,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,6,39966,63,I started this year ago The first day I couldnt leave the bathroom after that it was okay but it gives me gas and cramps really bad and it still does If I eat it goes away No gain or loss in weight on this drug Im not fat I do crave carbohydrates on it though My AC usually is in the sixs most of the time I have it checked every three months I was fighting this disease on my own but for me I gave up after three years because I was very limited to what I could eat I was diagnosed years ago with a starting AC of Got it down to with no medicines but that is when I gave up because the life style is just not conducive to normal life
2424,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,10,39961,18,So far it seems okay It controls my eating
2425,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,39961,42,First reaction was stomach cramps and diarrhea Things settled down in two days after three weeks now feel very tired
2426,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,8,39948,138,Metformin is helping me drastically in that it controls my insulin resistance First side effects were gas and diarreah and some bad breath but those have gone away I recommend this to anyone who has sugar problems
2427,Metformin,min,10,39941,184,I started glucophage xr on February I can not believe how much better I feel Before glucophage I spent every waking minute thinking about what I would eat next For the last years I stayed under calories a day and my readings were or I was up and down like a yoyo all day and night I gained weight constantly I weighed in at lbs on Feb Now months later on glucophage I have lost lbs and I eat like a normal person I cant believe the difference The first week on it I had some nausea but it went away and I now have no side effects I keep thinking this is a fluke a pill cant make that much of a difference I feel better than I have in years I now have energy because I am eating enough and my readings are amazing
2428,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10,39941,30,I was recently diagnosed finally with PCOS I have had irregular periods since I was In the past the only thing that would regulate me was birth control but since my husband and I have been trying for a baby I havent been on birth control for quite some time Just before getting confirmation on the PCOS I was diagnosed with Type diabetes and my family doctor put me on Metformin She said lucky for me pregnancy was a side effect in some cases Im not pregnant yet but I have started getting periods since I started taking it for the first time in years I feel really good about this medication especially after reading everyones comments Thank you all for the great feedback I look forward to the losing weight part too
2429,Metformin,min,6,39940,40,It works great but the downfall of Metformin is it causes you to have diarrhea but it controls my insulin resistance
2432,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,5,39913,55,I feel like it helps to lower my blood sugar but sometimes the side effects are unbearable I have severe stomach problems I take mg twice a day
2433,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7,39898,46,I have just recently been put onto metformin for control of my type diabetes I have been told it shall help not only with my blood levels but aid me in weight loss
2434,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8,39891,48,I have been using Metformin for about month and have already seen results Ive lost lbs and have gotten my period on a regular basis PCOS is not fun Ive become very emotional but with the proper medication diet and exercise it makes it a lot easier to cope with
2437,Metformin,min,9,39865,113,I have been taking Glucophage for years I have never had any side effects at all and my blood sugar level is always good
2438,Metformin,min,8,39839,125,I consider Glucophage a successful treatment because it has been prescribed to me for ten years and Ive had no adverse effects at all Aside from favorable bloodsugar results I dont even feel the drug is in my system

2441,Lovaza,Hypertriglyceridemia,10,41041,45,Worked very well Triglicerides went from to in just weeks The only medication that worked for me
2442,Lovaza,Hypertriglyceridemia,1,40745,42,Did not significantly help with my triglycerides Caused severe chest pain and shortness of breath

2462,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,10,42972,0,Uceris has been the best medicine I have tried for my collagenous colitis Everything else did not work or had too many side effects To me this is a miracle medicine They say to take one mg per day but believe it or not that actually made me constipated For me nothing took away the D even when I took seven Imodium a day So I started taking Uceris on a as needed basis It worked out to take one or two a week So for me I rated a with no side effects
2463,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,3,42803,4,I have UC for years I was in remission for a few years and then all of a sudden I had a flare up I have been one this medication for almost months When I first started on it it helped for like a week or so I had swelling in my face and joints and sore muscles and headaches My doctor told me to stick with it so my body could adjust properly and it helped but didnt stop my issues For the last week I have been going to the bathroom times a day Me and my doctor are now trying to figure out the next step
2464,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,9,42792,10,I am now on my second bottle of Uceris It took about weeks before it became effective for my microscopic colitis in other words when my diarrhea stopped completely After becoming effective I experienced side effects first swelling of both ankles that lasted a few days less than a week After that I had no ankle problem at all except for a feeling of pins and needles on both feet which I dont find problematic Second an increase in appetite which I needed as I had lost lb as a result of diarrhea The appetite increase lasted about days Uceris has given me a chance at feeling well and able to live my life

2471,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,8,41817,18,Been using Balsalazide x for years or so with occasional flareups I could resolve with slight overdosing Could not resolve present flare up After a month of bowel motions a day blood diarrhea doc started me on Uceris Next day change to bowel motion no blood slight diarrhea Now wk later pretty normal bowel motion per day with occasional nausea in abdomen I think pretty good for a week But the price is outrageous and even my copay is mo Doc insists on giving it to me for mos

2474,Ethacrynic acid,Edema,8,42240,8,I took this in as a test subject There was an article in Time magazine and they used the phrase wringing out the wet Along with the decrease in what was then called idiopathic edema I have a big decrease in bp winding up with readings of way too low for me I would get this quotstrangequot feeling have just enough time to go uh oh and then have to lay down I felt as tho I would fall if I moved It had all the classic symptoms of a diabetic low the dizziness heavy sweating overall malaise physical weakness However I was not a diabetic then was slim with no sighs of pre diabetes I stopped using it Later I was told it was only used in the hospital for extreme cases of fluid retention Now I see it on this list
2477,Cardizem CD,Atrial Fibrillation,5,41482,50,I was happy with medication as I did not have as many side effect but on day of taking it I developed a rash on my stomach next day chest and lower back third day neck and face It was the only thing I was doing differently so I looked up its side effects Rash was listed and could occur within to days It is a Saturday so as advised online I stopped the medication I hope this a temporary condition and I can begin again or an alternative can be found
2480,Cardizem CD,Atrial Fibrillation,1,40557,48,Been on this for over month AF still happening nearly everyday May last for hours I dont think it does any good Ill see doctor in days Hope he has something else to try
2481,Cardizem CD,Atrial Fibrillation,7,40060,65,I have been on this medicine for two months I have had one attack since I started I do feel a little tired and weak but no other side effects
2482,Cardizem CD,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9,40026,53,I have been on this medication a couple of years for supraventricular tachycardia and hypertension and have not had ONE episode of SVT since being on it I used to get SVT once or twice a month so this medicine has truly made my life better The problem I now face is with my insurance company since they are hiking up nongeneric copays to times as much as before Since there is no generic until I must either forego this medicine and try something else or pay something I cant afford This is frustrating when I know the medicine works
2485,Camrese,Birth Control,5,42621,0,I was excited to try this pill because it would cut down my period to only times a year However the spotting became a huge issue I began spotting during the first pack around the time I would typically get my period I knew this was a side effect but it lasted weeks and became a nuisance I soldiered through the pack and it eventually stopped and I got a very light period months later as scheduled The next pack was worse Again I started spotting after the first month It continued for weeks and turned into the heaviest period Ive ever had and I had to go to my doctor and be put on another pill to stop the bleeding and then switched pills This may work for some but it unfortunately didnt for me
2489,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42591,1,Ive been on camrese for almost a month before I was on lo seasonique which I loved better I switched because I was told it helped better with cramps an lighten your period but omg I been spotting every since I been on it My period was due last week but i just been spotting Im on my last week of pills this week I take my pill every morning on time never miss still spotting smh Im calling my doctor telling him I need to switch back over Its literally like your on your period for a whole month I dont recommend at all
2491,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42585,3,Horrible If I could rate a I would Started having headaches I never ever have headaches got my period for days weeks in bp went from to Missed doses so I followed the directions and upon taking them and my normal dose shit hit the fan I couldnt breathe my heart was racing and my bp went through the roof I was sent to er after my first visits to get checked for a PE have had a million tests done several ekgs and have an spot with a cardiologist I have been waiting for the drugs to get out of my system the half life is about a month and I am light headed have the worst anxiety never ever had it before so it really hard to deal with which is making it worse really jittery and and not happy
2494,Camrese,Birth Control,5,42545,4,I just started using this BC and it has been horrible I was told to just push through it amp that the pain would go away after the first full month I constantly have cramps as if Im starting my period and nauseous every other day Im also starting to develop headaches frequently but not sure if thats directly correlated
2497,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42511,3,Ive been on this birth control for almost years The first month I remember being very hungry all the time but that either stopped or I learned to deal with it I didnt get any other side effects from it The only reason Im not giving it a is because every cycle I start spitting about two weeks before Im supposed to get my period I just end up taking the period pills two weeks early to get it over with and start the next pack My periods have gotten much lighter most days I dont even need a tampon but I get bad cramps on or of the days which I never used to get before BC Over all I would recommend this birth control Although you MUST take it at exactly the same time every day or you will spot earlier
2499,Camrese,Birth Control,8,42493,1,I switched to camrese because my last birth control was giving me consistent debilitating migraines during the week of my period or if I forgot a pill It was too unbearable to experience that every month Im now on my second pack of camresemonth and so far it has been great I enjoy only having to deal with getting my period every months and I havent had a migraine yet Spotting happened for a short while in the beginning but it went away No weight gain I have been feeling more depressed just recently but its hard to know if its the BC or situational Ill be following up with my doctor
2500,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42477,10,This bc is horrible Going into my rd month and I havent stopped bleeding yet So much for the no months
2503,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42430,13,I was on Seasonique for a year or two and then a generic was made available and I switched to Camrese Ive been on Camrese for at least years and it is truly awesome for me But heres my advice to everyone Spotting I spotted occasionally on CamreseSeasonique and yes its normal But what my doctor told me and I have shared with friends experiencing the same is to stop your pill for days Allow the spotting to happen just as if it was a period and then resume your pill Be smart use backup birth control those days I found not always taking at the same time within hours to be the cause of the spotting Ive taken roughly different pills over the past years and Camrese worked best for me But everyone is different
2504,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42430,6,I started with this pill to get off the shot but it is no betterI cant sleep at night I have the worst headaches my cycle is never predictableI can see blood one day and nothing the next I can have sex one day and still bleed amp thats so embarrassing amp disgusting I hate this pill it was the worst choice ever
2505,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42423,8,I have only been taking camrese for weeks and i have been bleeding ever since I was told by my doctor to take it the first day of my period which i did Now usually my periods last days very little cramping if any and usually moderate to light Since taking this i feel like my guts are going to fall out The first few days i started having weird cramps in my upper stomach which felt like contractions when you are going to give birth than when that went away i would get normal cramping which i dont really care about but every other day my bleeding is different One day the bleeding can be very light and feels like its going to stop than later that night or the next i would be gushing to where i have to wear a tampon and a pad
2506,Camrese,Birth Control,5,42421,2,I went on this because I really liked the sound of only periods a year mine are miserable amp heavy I didnt have any spotting on the st pack However on just about every pack since then Ive had anywhere from weeks of spotting Sometimes its just brown discharge other times it warrants a tampon My periods are just as heavy and miserable I also initially had a massive acne flare up when I started Camrese About twice per pack Ill break out badly on my face once during my period and about weeks after that Ill be asking for a different brand at my next visit Been on this for year but hey I didnt get pregnant
2508,Camrese,Birth Control,6,43045,0,I got on birth control for my horrible cramps and to prevent getting pregnant I have had mostly ups but some downs using this birth control you must make sure to take it everyday around the same time because it does effect you when you are supposed to get your period Also I have major mood swings now depression and gained weight with taking this It does help majorly with my cramps and how much I was bleeding
2509,Camrese,Birth Control,10,43016,2,I lost weight and feel a lot less variable emotionally
2510,Camrese,Birth Control,8,42976,4,Been on this for years started about months after dating my boyfriend Occasional spotting but nothing compared to what others have described I am fortunate in that I have always had extremely light periods anyway and there hasnt really been a change except for frequency No weight gain and no acne or hair loss or any of the other things people have unfortunately described The only thing Ive noticed is a significant decrease in libido Like went from to zero within weeks of starting the pill By the time I figured out it wasnt going away I was too hesitant to switch since its the only side effect and any BC is a gamble so I just deal with it
2512,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42976,0,I have a semirare medical condition where I get intense horrendous mood swings due to a horomone imbalance Camrese has been the only birth control for me to solve this Ive taken birth controls that have made me gone into spouts of rage but after taking this for more than six months I can say this is the right medicine for me I have no more mood swings and the period pills have horomones in them so I wont have emotional swings there either I also have PCOS so whatever Its good to know Im still getting some estrogen to counteract the testosterone What is unusual now is that my period is so light that I only need a light pad Im currently days into it and its extremely managable It almost seems too good to be true
2513,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42946,0,Ive been taking this medication for about years now I had chronic migraines for over a year before I started taking this with no explanation as to why I was having such awful headaches every single day ObGyn recommended me on birth control and I havent had a migraine for years now I dont have any bad side affects from this birth control that Ive noticed yet Only having a period times a year is definitely a plus
2514,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42942,3,I am on the rd sheet of pills so about months in before taking i weighed now I am feel depressed just this week started to get brown discharge and thick red blood clots try to take the pill everyday with my coffee but I was an hour off a few times my boobs grew from C to double DD I dont mind but I do feel bloated and have had a couple angry depressed daysnot sure its worth these symptoms but before I had such bad cramps n migraines was in bed every month for days at least Plus I thought only being having early menopause with hot flashes n migraines this would help me not sure yet Staying on for another week or soo see what happens and the weight gain for me is the worst I dont fit in my pants plus need new bras
2516,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42928,1,I have been taking this birth control for about years I originally was taking Lo Seasonique but had to switch to this as it is the generic optionI began taking this in high school after suffering from crippling cramps and missing school due to these symptoms The first three months were full of spotting which I was warned of ahead of time After my first pack my body started to get used to this BCIt is a low dosage of hormones which works great for my body right now One thing I have noticed is that if I dont take my pill at exactly the same time each day I do begin spotting for a day or two There have been a few occasions where I have forgotten or taken it or so hours late which has caused spotting to begin
2517,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42918,6,Ive been on this for about three months now The first month and a half were great No mood swings no spotting or headaches or depression but then I got into my third month and was experiencing breakthrough bleeding a lot and then had several blood clots And I am still having spotting Ive been depressed acne is horrible I have horrible food cravings not to mention awful cramps to where I cant even move I want to continue and try to see if it gets better but I am just having the worst time with this and am miserable that I am over taking this I know for some it has worked and maybe if I stick it out it will get better but I have no interest in continuing with this bc
2518,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42833,4,I have taken Camrese for years now The first few months were difficult as my body adjusted to the new hormones The typical nausea and mood swings However by the th month of taking it I was feeling great I experience no side effects from the pill My libido is high weight gain only lb difference than prepill weight and my periods are more manageable So far pregnancy protection Because I only have a period times a year my life is so much easier No more missing work debilitating cramps or scheduling around periods for travel days and beach fun If you do not mind pushing through the first couple of months of hormonal changes everyone is affected differently then I highly recommend this brand
2519,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42831,1,I have been taking birth control for almost years After switching insurance companies I was also forced to switch birth control I was also placed on the extended cycle birth control to lower the chance of the cysts I just had removed returning This birth control made me have crazy mood swings and feel very depressed I rated it because hey I didnt get pregnant and I dont feel pain indicating my cysts have returned I am approaching my nd month not taking this my skin looks worse than it ever has and I am broken out on my jawline I would never break out there previously My mood however has resumed to its former chipper selfI would not recommend this birth control to anyone
2521,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42816,1,Im weeks into this pill I have PMDD and treat it with other Medication but it makes me sad and depressed even with the other medication The anxiety is through the roof This pill makes me so tired I also have horrible night sweats every night I also cant sleep The insomnia is awful Headaches everyday I have spent the last month trying to figure out what my deal was and its this awful pill I thought I may of had another condition The idea of periods a year is amazing but this pill just isnt worth it I am stopping this pill ASAP and hoping that everything returns to normal in a few days Oh and the fact that I have completely lost my sex drive Yeah that sucks too I just want to sleep and not sweat at night
2523,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42794,3,I was diagnosed with PMDD and it was severe I dreaded my periods every month and there was always one day a month I literally couldnt function Doctors wanted to prescribe Mirena but for many reasons I am against IUDs We tried so many birth controls and I had issues with all of them and they never put a dent in my PMDD Thank goodness for my Dr She explained to me what nobody else explained to me is that all birth controls are different in their levels of hormones some have more estrogen some have more progesterone and I think its even more complex then that anyways Camrese is supposedly as similar to Mirena that you can get in pill form Its been like night and day for me I feel amazing Only complaint is cold sweats
2525,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42774,3,Ive been on camrese for about a year now and its the best birth control Ive had yet All the others I bled for months and had super crazy mood swings The only thing that really sucks about it is that I have NO sex drive But the fact that I only have a period every months makes up for it Every so often ill get some really light bleeding but its not even enough to validate wearing a tampon for
2526,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42754,6,Everything was okay until the end of the first pack Then I spotted for months straight I am now having my period and it is just like how they were before the medicine only with more cramps I usually have awful cramps the first day then they go away Im days in and the cramps havent gotten better I am remaining hopeful for the next month set though
2527,Camrese,Birth Control,8,42737,8,Ive been on the Camrese three month birth control for a total of months now The first three month pack did not go too well which is why I gave it an eight for a rating After the first month I spotted heavy enough to ruin underwear but not enough to use a padtampon up until month three when it was time for my actual period I would have specific periods of sadness as well but no weight gain But I decided to see if it got any better IT DID My second three month pack I did not have any spotting and there is no weight gain with me or mood swings that I have noticed I have fallen in love with this birth control
2528,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42712,1,This is my second time on the camrese lo My first experience was pretty crappy I started spotting the last week of the first pack and didnt stop spotting until the week before my period week I had a easy light period whice was nice I had my dr give me a script for something else just taking a normal day cycle My period was terrible though so i chose to try the camrese lo again So far im in the third pack and no spotting I think my body needed to re adjust or something from the mini pill i was on before Either way im very happy with my results the second time around
2530,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42689,0,The first contraceptive pill that works for me No depression with this pill just a few weeks of heavy PMSlike symptoms cramps exhaustion moodiness at first then it stabilized Trustworthy predictable and not having a period but once a quarter has been nice
2532,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42682,6,My daughter was on this birth control for a few years I lost her to a pulmonary embolism last year She was only Do I feel this pill played some part in what happened absolutely Be careful and weigh your options I took birth control and not for one minute did I think this would happen but everyones body acts differently and tolerates things differently There needs to be a safer way for young girls
2533,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42103,1,I have had horrible acne since taking this birth control All over my body acne I didnt realize it could be the birth control until I read a bunch of other reviews on it My boobs hurt all the time No sex drive what so ever I dont even want my husband to touch me because my boobs hurt so bad Needless to say I sympathize with some of the other reviewers on this birth control I will be talking to my doctor to switch to something else The only good part about it is not getting my period for months
2535,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42052,3,Im currently taking this and the first two entire packs were fine some minimal spotting that went away within a few days This rd pack was fine until the cycle was supposed to start I had breakthrough bleeding for weeks It has finally slowed down but hasnt stopped completely Other than that this has worked decently but I feel there are too many other options for me to suffer like this
2536,Camrese,Birth Control,3,41934,10,Took this for only weeks before having to stop Caused a lump in my right breast sad mood daily constant nausea and NO sex drive
2537,Camrese,Birth Control,2,41912,11,I developed terrible depression taking this medication The first month and a half were fine even energizing I actually slept less and felt more alert the first few weeksThe first two nights I took the pill I only slept hours and woke up sweating and then couldnt sleep the rest of the night This side effect went away and then all was pretty normal for awhile Then I felt myself slowly slipping into a funk It started with a negative attitude towards things I used to enjoy and progressed into terrible depression I suspected the pill and the day after the months ended I felt immediately better and happy again It was like day and night I went back to Nuvaring after this experience
2539,Camrese,Birth Control,8,41857,9,Ive spent months on Camrese and its been great No period my acne and mood swings were under control I had occasional spotting and over the course of the past year Ive gained lbs with no other lifestyle changes which are the only reasons I will be discussing changing medication with my doctor
2540,Camrese,Birth Control,8,41826,5,I liked this medication and stayed on it for almost years However the vaginal dryness was so bad and embarrassing that I had to switch I also think the medication caused hair loss
2541,Camrese,Birth Control,1,41672,31,Taking this pill was an awful experience Everything was going fine until right around the time that I started the second month of it and since then I have had nasty breakthrough bleeding ever since then Not to mention the breast soreness leg cramps and depression Im finishing the pill this week and it hasnt gotten any better or worse So basically Ive had my period for weeks straight
2542,Camrese,Birth Control,3,41610,10,Only on day of this pill and my chest back and face are broken out completely I have bumps literally everywhere Little clusters of bumps are popping up too My breasts are starting to hurt and Ive had bad menstrual cramps today Im also super emotional as well Cried all evening for no reason and got so mad I thought my chest was going to explode So mood swings are definitely a side effect Maybe Ill see some better effects in the next month
2543,Camrese,Birth Control,4,41504,8,I have never been more exhausted in my life while on this birth control pill I was diagnosed with endometriosis and have now been on this pill for months I am still moody constantly tired feel the dull pain in my lower stomach and have had breakthrough bleeding already The bloating is awful and my breasts are so swollen and tender that I cant stand to wear a bra I was on Seasonale before and did not have these side effects whatsoever so will hopefully be going back to that now that this pill has completely changed me as a person
2545,Camrese,Birth Control,2,41079,16,Breakthrough bleeding headaches nausea bloatingHave been bleeding for almost two weeks On the fourth week of the first packet
2548,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42381,2,Was on Seasonique for a couple years it worked extremely well Hardly any breakthrough bleeding Camrese started out okay but within a couple months the bleeding began and would not stop I had consistent spotting for MONTHS I am now just coming off this pill and have started with a new one Hope this one stops the bleeding
2551,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42336,7,Good birth control for preventing against pregnancy However I thought it would be great to only have period sometimes I was wrong I had my period all of the time literally It got to the point where I had it for a full month with only a couple days without it Only take if you for sure have a regulated period with birth control
2552,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42313,6,Been taking this for a year and my body never regulated to it I spotted through almost the whole pack every single time Sexual intercourse became painful for me This has personally been the worst experience with birthcontrol for me I thought it would have been nice having a day cycle but given that I have bled through over days of it it is just absolutley not worth it
2553,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42311,5,I just wish the bleeding would stop Its light but annoying I took Seasonique before and I loved the comfort of having only periods a year I just hope I can make it long enough for this discomfort to end Im on my third month and the bleeding started weeks ago
2554,Camrese,Birth Control,4,42310,5,I was not a fan of this pill It was supposed to be three months noncyclic and I still had a period every month longer than normal And I would bleed in between It also made me gain pounds in weeks while I was counting calories and working out It was impossible to lost weight on it It made me super emotional I was constantly weepy and depressed many days I dont want to take this one ever again
2555,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42310,7,I loved this birth control Ive been on or so different pills but this is the best so far Only complaint is the intense cramps around the time of my period My period last days with normal bleeding and painful cramps The cramps are bad but not strong enough to stop taking them especially because they only occur every months I think the reason for my positive time on the pills was because Ive been on steady birth control for years straight Sad news Ive had to change to non estrogen birth control because of my high blood pressure I miss this so much lol
2556,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42308,5,I am on the third month of this birth control Since I have started Camrese my face remains clear and my breats grew a bit as well And I like the idea of having only four periods a year However the spotting has been an absolute nightmare I had no spotting at all up until the end of month two and the spotting has not stopped since I am nearing the end of month three Sometimes it will seem like it has stopped but then an hour later I will be bleeding again It is exhausting I dont know when it will stop but I hope it will stop soon or Ill definitely switch pills again The spotting is the only negative side affect I have had thus far
2557,Camrese,Birth Control,9,42304,7,I got on this due to migraines I would have when I got my period This medication has been a savior When I first got on it I had some problems I have break through bleeding in the second month that become a full on period so I was on my period for two months but I figured it was my body getting adjusted Im on my third three month pack now No break through bleeding My boobs hurt three weeks before I get my period but other than that these medication is amazing I have my sex drive back no headaches clear skin and no weight gain
2558,Camrese,Birth Control,1,42304,6,This is the generic version of Seasonique I had been on Seasonique up until I Got pregnant which was about years After I gave birth my doctor put me on Camrese For the longest time I thought the terrible side effects were because I gave birth years later I am realizing it is Camrese I have been tired non stop depressed super emotional over the most simple things have gained pounds that I cant seem to shake headaches and my appetite has increased I would not recommend getting this birth control I will be switching back to Seasonique tomorrow it never gave me any problems
2559,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42296,4,I have been on this for over a year and I am sad that it isnt working for certain things I have a very light day period every time no breakthrough bleeding no cramps headaches or anything else My skin cleared up immensely The three biggest problems were the fact that ever since I have been on this I have absolutely no sex drive at all I have been so depressed and down and I gained pounds because of the hormone levels I would still be on it if the couple side effects I have werent so large
2562,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42266,1,So I originally started on camrese for dealing with my heavy flowpainful periods like super painful and when I started I was bleeding for over weeks I hated it it wasnt a lot of blood more like light but it was frustrating as I was not comfortable with having to wear pads all the time so I went other my doctor and she prescribed Junel fe It was terrible I had irritability nausea etc So I asked to go back to camrese and it worked for the first months no problem but then I had spotting again So I asked for a new pill but that made my period twice as heavy flow I then asked my doctor if I could have the same hormones in camrese but for monthly and not yearly but she said I can do that myself I love it now
2563,Camrese,Birth Control,2,42257,2,This birth control made me miserable By the completion of the first week I started to get these crippling headaches nausea and dizziness I also experienced a couple episodes of serious night sweats I was extremely sad the entire time I was on it To top all of that off I never stopped bleeding Thats right Ive been bleeding for weeks straight and counting Finally my mother and husband had to force me off the stuff because they saw how miserable I was The only positive was that my skin cleared up a great deal It just wasnt for me
2565,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42236,0,Ive been on this birth control for six months Pros sex drive is out of control light period period every three months which is wonderful short period Im taking days light bleed no cramps no bloatingCons took my pills before bed and the night sweats are a bummer breakthrough bleeding here and there until month four took awhile to adjust
2566,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42167,4,My doctor prescribed Camrese to lessen my increasing heavy periods presumably due to perimenopause Im at the end of the sixth month taking this drug and have nothing positive to say about it Ive gained pounds in months and am depressed that its summer and I cant fit in my size clothes anymore Whats worse is that Ive had consistent break through bleeding for the last weeks and expecting the quotforcedquot period next week Im wondering if I should just DEAL with the uber heavy periods at least they were predictable and only lasted days There was also weeks of spotting during the first months on this pill Needless to say Im consulting my ObGyn next week to try something different This pills not for me
2567,Camrese,Birth Control,10,42163,8,Literally a miracle drug my first time in a long time not having my extremely horrible period best month of my life no spotting this is my first time using birth control my acne is nonexistent my breast are larger which is a plus for me and Ive lost weight in all the right places Im so happy with this product
2568,Camrese,Birth Control,6,42146,6,At first the Camrese was great It successfully treated my cramping mood swings and acne The first two cycles I did experience some spotting but it decreased and eventually ended For about another months I experienced nearly no problems with the Camrese A little over a year from starting the Camrese I began to get significant spotting and I would take the pill at the EXACT same time everyday I also began to develop an insatiable appetite that would last a week before my period and a week after I started the new pack What prompted me to look for other forms of BC was that my mood swings would occur a week before during and after my period to the point where I was overwhelmed with unexplained angerfrustration
2569,Camrese,Birth Control,3,42137,5,I have been taking this medication for a month No breakthrough bleeding and my menstrual cycle has been a great but the negative side effects have been miserable I experienced severe mood swings depression and I am usually a happy person bloating weight gain increased appetite breast tenderness discomfort and pain in my abdomen and extreme fatigue I have been miserable since starting this medication and will discontinue it and try something else
2571,Camrese,Birth Control,7,42116,5,I love the fact of not having a period for months but there is absolutely NO sexdrive during the whole three months of taking the pill except for the first week after your period I had breakthrough bleeding for about a month but it stopped after I started the next pack I have no other side effects but the whole no sex drive thing kinda sucks
2572,Acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / pseudoephedrine,Cold Symptoms,5,42295,4,Night time Nyquil worked and relieved my stuffiness and allowed me to sleep a full hours However I did awake in the morning with excitability and extreme Hypertension This condition resolved after discontinuing night time Nyquil This medication is no longer for me for this reason after using it for years
2573,Acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / pseudoephedrine,Cold Symptoms,10,41207,6,Great Fell asleep
2574,Acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / pseudoephedrine,Cold Symptoms,9,40167,3,It tastes horrible but really helps and gets you sleeping

2578,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,42305,95,Started Plaquenil months agomg xday to treat Psoriatic arthritis and sjogrens Learned to NOT take it in the morning with my Meloxicam mg because of strong nausea If I take one after a big lunch and one after dinner I have no problems at all Joints and hands wrists are doing so much better One worry is that I am too tired to do anything at all If I do laundry I sweat If I cook dinner or rake the yard I sweat I seem to even have trouble sleeping on my side at night because of trouble getting enough air into my lungs Weird I know I rated it an because I do not feel sick after taking it and it does seem to work The last but not least worry is heavy hair loss I have thin and fine hair anyway but it comes out like crazy
2579,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,42304,108,This medication did wonders for my soreness and pain from Rheumatoid Arthritis but if someone would have told me I would have devastating and irreversible eye damage due to taking it I would have chosen a different drug for sure at least after the year mark when it is known to cause major problems that will be with you for life
2580,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1,42290,34,I started this med as I have both RA and Systemic Lupus It did nothing for me and we added Methotrexate still no benefit Added Enbrel no better My eyesight was beginning to fail so I stopped all of them My weight ballooned up by lbs I have found no mainline meds to help and had to turn to Traditional Chinese Medicine for relief Works great for me I am still hoping to find something in the regular vein of meds to help and not hurt me My insurance will not cover the help of the Traditional Chinese Medicine that is helping Whats up with that
2581,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1,42262,22,I have been taking plaquenil for over weeks to treat autoimmune hair loss My hair and itchy scalp has not improved at all In fact it was even worse for a few weeks Now Im getting sores all around my eyes with a cyst on my eyelid and an inflamed blood vessel I called my rheumy today to ask for a switch Im very disappointed because it seemed like the best out of the bunch for side effects
2582,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,42256,58,I had Lyme disease and a subsequent RA dx I have been on Plaquenil for months mg x a day and now x day It has helped a great dealI was also taking Collagen and a few herbs for inflammation I am doing much much better and able to do a lot of things I thought I never would again I have occasional stiffness but its hardly an issue On the downside I do have bad nightmares not all the time but they are something I am not happy about Anecdotally they may be correlated to Alcohol I occasionally get nausea and headaches as well but the headaches are mild and only once a week or soFingers crossed that the side effects diminish and that this drug keeps on keeping on I am best to you all D
2583,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,42245,50,I live in Uk and having all treatment under the National Health ServiceI have RA fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis blepharitis and interstitial lung disease Blimey I hear you say quite rightly I say it every dayI take hydroxychloraquine in conjunction with methatrexate and etanercept and they seem to work well together However since my methatrexate was reduced due to continual chest infections I have notice recurrance of swelling and pain has increased I am now on mg of morphine MST slow release x per day and oramorph instant effect morphine for breakout pain Docs told me that they know the three meds work in conjunction with each other but they dont know why Who cares give me the drugs Hope this helps
2586,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10,42166,73,I first went on Plaquenil in due to unbearable finger and wrist joint pain for months which was diagnosed as Lupus after a skyhigh ANA test and some other tests and diagnoses I was told it would take ish weeks to kick in and it did right on schedule Almost overnight I went from not able to hold a soda can or open a door to being pain free I was on Plaquenil for years during which time I was in complete remission so in I discontinued it In Lupus reared its ugly head again this time with Pleurisy Got back on Plaquenil and after the requisite waiting time it got the problem under control not maybe I love Plaquenil but my advice to others is to be very patient and give it time to work
2588,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42125,76,I started this medication a week ago and have had very vivid dreams I used to wake up with rib and hip painstiffness I also couldnt relax and lay in bed because my body just felt restless I would say that on day I woke up almost completely relaxed and nearly no stiffness I also started taking Celebrex on the same day so Im not sure if its the combination of the two or one or the other but I feel so much better I am a year old female and mom of a year old
2589,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42115,90,Feel so much better since being on Plaquenil since Always have reg eye tests My inflammation level is only a now and it was Still feel a little tired now and then but I blame it on working hrs a week Hope this drug helps you too
2590,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,9,42046,12,For the past years I have had itching on my head Can be any area of scalp None on face I take mg of antihistimine every day just to keep it mild But it doesnt stop it No redness no dry scalp
2591,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,7,42044,31,I started taking this medication three months agoNovember The doctor told me it would take up to three months to work After the first month the fatigue lessenedI didnt want to sleep all day longI actually wanted to moveSoon after the occurrence of joint pain also loweredIt still hurts when I push myself to hard and onrainy days but the pain isnt consistent anymore
2592,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,8,41959,90,I was diagnosed with Sjogrens Syndrome months ago I also have rheumatoid Arthritis and Hashimotos My rheumatologist prescribed Plaquenil in hopes to control all conditions I would say that Plaquenil has basically given me my life back I suffer from debilitating joint pain fatigue brain fog and extreme anxiety I had to quit working because as a high school teacher brain fog and anxiety are probably of the worst things you should be dealing with when dealing with teenagers I would give Plaquenil a but I havent been on it long enough to see the full effects I continue to have more energy every day Im back to walking as exercise again and my joint pain is very well controlled
2595,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2,41870,37,I experienced a rash over my entire body about weeks after starting taking this medicine I dont really know if it would have worked for me or not
2596,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,7,41843,48,This medication worked great for me except for some stomach upset which was I tolerating because I wanted to stay off Prednisone However three weeks into taking the medication I developed an allergy to it and broke out in hives all over my body So I had to discontinue sadly Very sorry not to be able to take this medication as it seems the best one for controlling my Lupus with the least side effects
2597,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,8,41797,71,I am only on Plaquenil a month now for primary Sjogrens Syndrome having been diagnosed in Jan So far I am feeling much better in that I am sleeping so much better Before taking medication I would wake times a night and found it difficult to go back to sleep now I only wake up once and go back almost immediately This is thefirst thing that I have noticed and I know it is very early days as my Rheumatologist said it can take months before any results
2601,Plaquenil,Dermatomyositis,8,41667,15,I have dermatomyositis Plaquenil along with quinicrine treated my hand lesions which were very painful This took about a year to accomplish Its been about a year and a half now and Im starting to react to one or both of the medications I have a rash all over my body and ulcers and lichen planus in my mouth Im seeing my doctor shortly to see about this
2602,Plaquenil,Lyme Disease Arthritis,9,41656,46,Plaquenil has been great for me It has reduced the stiffness amp swelling in hands amp feet to almost nothing Started at mg twice a day and have since reduced to one time per day I have a complete eye exam once a year to watch for possible retina side effects
2605,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,41457,157,I was told that I have rheumatoid arthritis a few months back I have been on Plaquenil now for almost months It has helped with the pain in my hands and feet I still have swollen fingers but am waiting for the full affects of the drug I do not know how common this is but the side effect that I am having is hair loss I am guessing it wouldnt be as bad if I was a male but being a female I am hoping this stops after my body gets used to the medicine because I am very discouraged with that aspect
2606,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,10,41396,155,Before Plaquenil I would be in bed for days at a time unable to move excessive pain ice cold migraines the whole gamut My body felt ancient At first the rheumatologist thought I had leukemia then Lupus and rheumatoid athritis and finally biopsies started giving us a more refined treatment plan With this medicine I am in much less pain I can walk for an hour at a time I can shop for groceries again I feel like I have a life again I have had brief periods never more than a month without it and I know that life without the benefit of Plaquenil is no life at all Yes I have to see the retina specialist but in all this time my eyes are fine Dont hesitate to try it even though new treatments can be scary
2607,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,41380,139,I had very few side effects with this medicine in the beginning but it didnt provide enough relief on days when I had to be on my feet for a few hours a day It didnt remove all inflammation so I was taken off and tried on methotrexate a lot worse side effects and no relief at all I had no vision changes with Plaquenil and I would much rather have some relief than none I was able to function with minimum pain with Plaquenil
2608,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,41342,121,I have been taking Plaquenil for about months I started out with mgx day along with Prednisone to treat my RA slowly tapering off the steroids Now I am just on PlaquenilI have to say that the pain is still there especially in the morning and late evening Sometimes it is difficult to fall asleep but I gave it a because it is nothing like before when I took no medication Perhaps it works better for others I still have the swelling and stiffness in the mornings but as I said nothing like beforeIt also only gets a because the headaches I get while taking it are debilitating I sometimes wonder if the trade off is worth it They start about minutes after taking it and last until I manage to fall asleep Sigh

2636,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,42797,71,I began taking Plaquenil for RA month ago Despite information from my doctor that it would be at least months before I see an appreciable effect I am feeling better than I have in the last year Prior to Plaquenil I tried Mobic amp Medrol both with limited improvement But over the last few weeks I have been able to play basketball with my son again move without thinking or a warm up period return to the gym begin Pilates amp Ive lost pounds I did have some GI upset over the last month but nothing I would consider stopping this medication for I am able to enjoy things again amp live life without discomfort

2641,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42618,89,Ive been on this drug since Before meds I was so sick with RA symptoms Spent hours a day in bed couldnt dress or bath myself Seldom ate Doctor put me on mg plaquenil twice daily and mg prednisone and I got my life back Ive since drop prednisone and am down to mg once daily plaquenil About to go on the generic form of plaquenil A little concerned Is the quality the same My specialist said no RA drugs are so scary Ive had friends die on biologicsand some go blind My advice as geezergirl When you find out what works for you hold on tight to it
2645,Plaquenil,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1,42444,27,I was on this medication for one day when I began to gave sereve vomiting minutes after taking it and stomach bloating and uncontrollable gas By day six I called my doctor to tell him I had bilateral muscle weakness in my legs and could hardly walk a straight line without feeling like I was going to fall down My doctor stopped the medication after six days after I began to take it when I presented with a known severe adverse side effect of this medication quot muscle weakness and loss of coordinationquot

2648,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,42430,48,Im and was told I have arthritis about months ago Plaquenil worked after the first couple of weeks but one major side effect is Mouth Ulcers and at times Ive been in so much pain with them I couldnt eat But then the alternative one said it could make my hair fall out and that is not an option at my age
2650,Plaquenil,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10,42392,26,I had only had a mild SLE flare about years ago I had plenty of the discoid lupus symptoms but they were easily controlled with avoiding the sun and using sunscreensespecially in the last years I developed another autoimmune problem about years agogluten intolerance or or possible CD I ate the quotglutenfreequot Cheerios when they hit the shelves about months ago and almost killed myself as they were not gluten free This touched off a SLE flare of unbelievable proportions Practically every joint in my body was hurting SO badlyand I had fever and fatigue and did not respond to NSAIDs Placquenil has been my lifesaver Adhering to an antiinflammatory diet for a month helped also The priceworth it
2651,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,42391,195,I have been on Plaquenil since when I was diagnosed with RA When I was diagnosed I was in severe pain unable to hold my infant child or drive My rheumatologist injected me with steroids to get me immediate relief and started me on Plaquenil I dont remember my initial dosage but I take mg once per day and have been in remission since and I have had no side effects that I am aware of I have regular eye exams and periodic screenings by a retinologist and my eyes have had no issues at all

2655,Plaquenil,Sjogrens Syndrome,2,40633,41,I have seen no benefits from this medication after months of use My migraines have increased to almost daily now and have also increased in their intensity
2660,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,40340,166,I began taking Plaquenil weeks ago and I am pleased with it Im now seeing the benefits and my Rheumatologist says that I should continue to get even better over the next months Honestly Im okay with where Im already at The biggest surprise is that Im receiving benefits that I didnt get from mgday of Prednisone The hardest part was when I first began Plaquenil You initially experience side effects without any benefit but you just have to hang in there The side effects start to improve significantly after weeks My side effects were nausea loose stools vomiting and temporary changes in vision full eye exam confirmed that everything is fine I would highly recommend this medicine

2748,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,3,41546,41,Diltiazem for High Blood Pressure Atrial Fibrillation Atrial Flutter I took Diltiazem before surgery and then continued it after for high blood pressure It worked just fine for a while although the hr only lasted for hours in my case Then I started getting toothaches and really bad gingivitis I did have gingivitis already I also started feeling lousy and only by coincidence did I stop taking the Diltiazem Two day later my toothaches were gone and my gums stated clearing up I still thought it was a coincidence I restarted Diltiazem again and the same thing happened again
2749,Mydayis,ADHD,8,43070,2,Ive been taking Mydayis for about weeksI was diagnosed with ADHD yrs ago and took Adderall XR mgs mgs every day Even though it helped me in many ways it also made me antisocial anxious over use it sometimes and very thirsty at all timesFor those reasons I decided to try something else Mydayis Honestly I feel much more motivated my energy increased Im not longer antisocial no crash and most importantly I can focus wellFor about a week I had some side effects increased heart beat couldnt sleep focus well high BP so give it some time to adjust I also read that most people that switched from Vyvanse to Mydayis are suffering from depression Be careful
2755,Mydayis,ADHD,10,43047,5,I was on Vyvanse mg for Bulimia it stopped the binge eating however I could never fall asleep not even with a sleeping pill and I always felt so very depressed in the late afternoon my doctor told me about Mydayis I switched to Mydayis mg which works even better I get a good nights sleep without a sleeping pill The only side effect is dry mouth and an occasional headache If I wait too late to take it Its always best to take it early in the morning I take mine at am I still have remained free from any binge eating episodes Thankful for this medication
2759,Mydayis,ADHD,9,43041,4,Mydayis works great if you are on the right dose I noticed some people on here are not getting the right strength when converting from Vyvanse or Adderall To the person whorsquos doctor switched you from of Vyvanse to mg of Mydayis your getting less medication Thatrsquos why itrsquos not working for you You should be taking mg You will notice a BIG difference
2761,Mydayis,ADHD,4,43014,7,I was prescribed vyvanse chewable mg in the am and at noon I loved it but had a month where I didnt take it regularly at noon Dr suggested this because of the extended release weeks in My sleep is concerning I havent hit rem in days now I have no appetite even in the am before I take the mydayis I have to force feed myself even icecream is a struggle after the rd bite The hours after I take it I feel lost cant track conversations nominimal recall I cant even prioritize After those hours things level out a bit but I dont have the motivation I had with Vyvanse I believe there is link between loss of quality sleep and stuggling to meet my dietary requirements and how the drug affects me
2762,Mydayis,ADHD,5,43012,7,Taking mg right now and was on adderall XR mg I dont understand this medicine since it usually makes me tired and down for about hours after taking it then get an okay amount of focus for another hours I personally cant deal with those hours everyday when I need to be productive so I will try something else This drug may be very similar to the chemicals in adderall but it definitely does not feel like it
2766,Mydayis,ADHD,2,42993,10,Not at all what I expected Have used Vyvanse with success but went back to adderall more flexibility dosing Can take a second dose during the day if necessary or not Mydayis takes an unusually long time to kick in Have found that I am much more irritable foggy and have experienced feelings of being overwhelmed at work doing things that I normally handle day in and day out with no problem I am for the most part easy going everything seems to annoy me since I began using Mydayis Also have experienced headaches during lag times body aches and flu like symptoms A lot of the time I feel worse than I do unmedicated Do not like Mydayis at all Will not be refilling
2767,Mydayis,ADHD,1,42991,15,I wanted this medication to work because I often forget to take my second generic adderral dose on time However Mydayis is not the wonder drug I wanted it to be It takes up to hours to kick in something they hide in the facts and even though I quotworkedquot this drawback by waking up earlier to take it there wasnt enough positives to keep me taking it past week four It lasted about hours before it quickly declined and leaving me with even worse ADD symptoms It was so bad I couldnt have a conversation or focus enough to make dinner without skipping into laundry cleaning or some other distractions Without the use of any medication I have never had symptoms this bad If this wasnt bad enough I had horrible nausea and indigestion
2768,Mydayis,ADHD,1,42991,10,Meh I was on Vyvanse mgday amp switched to Mydayis mgday NOT what I was hoping for Not by a Long Shot While it quotlasts longerquot than VYVANSE was on Vyvanse for years which only gave me about hours in the end it gives me MUCH LESS motivation Makes me depressed Im Very Sorry I did not only get Only a week supply rather than month I have no insurance amp it was about more than Vyvanse Needless to say I will request Vyvanse again at my next appt BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
2772,Mydayis,ADHD,2,42985,7,Not helpful for hyperactivity Lasts a long time but doesnt help much On mg but maybe the dose recommendation is too low
2773,Mydayis,ADHD,1,42981,12,Never had so many thoughts really down thoughts as I did well on this medication Also daily dosage only lasted hours before effect decreased rapidly Generic Adderall lasts longer with no downers This one was not the godsend I had hoped it would be
2775,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,10,40060,31,After my cardiologist tried me on many different combinations of Blood Pressure medications over a period of years Diltiazem worked perfectly Im on the maximum dosage allowed but take it twice a day in different dosages With Hyzaar at breakfast I take mg of Diltiazem With dinner I take mg of Diltiazem I have had no side effects that Im aware of Incidentally when I was put on Diltiazem I was taken off Toprol XL and I felt so much better after Toprol was out of my system I had no idea it was affecting me adversely until I was off it I saw on the review of Toprol that for as many people who said they tolerated it well there were an equal amount of others who had bad reactions to it
2776,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,8,40049,30,Helps my atrial fibrillation Last ECG was normal
2777,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,10,40035,50,I was on Cartia XT when they discontinued it It is the ONLY drug that works for me There was no warning from CVS either I went into fibrillation The doctor put me on four different drugs after that of which none worked One was too hard and large to swallow one had food dye and I am allergic and one made my head ring terribly Another one is on the way but it is twice a day Since I also have fibromyalgia I have to be extra careful
2779,Diltiazem,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9,40026,53,I have been on this medication a couple of years for supraventricular tachycardia and hypertension and have not had ONE episode of SVT since being on it I used to get SVT once or twice a month so this medicine has truly made my life better The problem I now face is with my insurance company since they are hiking up nongeneric copays to times as much as before Since there is no generic until I must either forego this medicine and try something else or pay something I cant afford This is frustrating when I know the medicine works
2781,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,10,40001,66,I use Cartia XT for Afibrillation The only problem I ran into was using generics CVS switched their provider and it did not work as well days of Afibrillation and I went on the real deal What a difference everything is back to normal
2782,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,5,39957,59,I switched to Cardizem from ToprolXL Cardizem tires me for about hours then Im good
2783,Diltiazem,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,39956,72,I have been taking Cartia XT for supraventricular tachycardia for about years This medication has completely controlled the racing heart that I used to get from time to time Ive had no side effects A big bonus is that eating ice cream used to trigger the racing heart beat Now I can eat ice cream
2785,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,6,39926,52,Be prepared for a quotmental health dayquot My first mg dose wiped me out for a full hours I was dizzy and just plain off Sitting to standing was a crash and burn experiment It passed quickly and since nd day was okay
2786,Diltiazem,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,8,39909,24,I have taken Diltiazem for the past week for blood pressure and angina issues pain in my chest I has worked wonders however it does make you rather dizzy at times I take this with Plavix as my cardiologist recommended
2787,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,10,39818,133,Excellent treatment for high blood pressure Been taking for over years with excellent results
2788,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,8,39722,52,Ive recently started it to lower excessive blood pressure It does that I feel more comfortable and relaxed too However it does bring on light headaches sometimes
2789,Diltiazem,Atrial Fibrillation,10,39610,152,I am taking Cartia XT MG for atrial fibrillation It works and I have not noticed any other side effects other than being sleepy all of the morning I take it at am and usually could fall asleep without much prompting However Im not groggy and can concentrate fine The heart is in rhythm and thats what counts
2790,Dynacin,Acne,8,39800,10,This drug is very helpful I used to have pus filled acne all over my face and now very few of them It does nothing for white heads and clogged pores but does get rid of the pus filled looking ones
2791,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,7,43056,1,At bulging cervical disks CC stenosis with radiculopathy into my trachea Very strange and unbelievably painful years tons of epidurals physical therapy hot packs and yes pain meds This one is a winner with a giant caveatFirst narco then percocet then oxycontin then zohydro then back to Narco Not funBELBUCA It works well enough You have ZERO euphoria or any druggie feeling you can function and be productive The pain blocking sensation that a true opioid provides is thereMy only gripe is the tiny hr ldquomouth patchrdquo itself This is a disaster and has caused several destroyed patches that refused to insert and stck to finger HUGELY frustrating Will not properly dose unless applied perfectly
2792,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,2,43028,2,I hate reading reviews before I take a med because it does have a placebo affect on you whether itrsquoll work or not If yoursquore doing this stop Just take the meds and see how it works for YOU But I was put on belbuca after misusing Vicodin from chronic pain and disc replacement surgery Vicodin helped but dosage wasnrsquot enough and I abused it But belbuca Never helped my pain Started at and had WDs so bumped to mg and helped WDs but not pain I had break through meds but Belbuca renders them useless I ended up taking more BT meds trying to help pain on bad days but then sent red flags to my doc He didnrsquot seem to get Belbuca did not work for me Withdrawals are GOD AWFUL
2793,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1,42969,7,I tried the mcg no relief and dr refused to give break thru pain meds told me to use OTC meds alternate Tylenol and Advil every hrs for the st month but she finally gave me ten pain pills for st month So the end month I go to mcg and get copay help card well after three days of runaround they tell me the card only works for st month If the pharmacy puts it in right so my script had a copay which I can not afford Tried to ask why they advertise help with copay yet they dont really offer help So instead of paying For second month I had to pay full copay so just make sure you can afford it before you start it Oh and no the film dont actually help as the s actually bunch and not melt so
2794,Belbuca,Pain,1,42951,14,I was on Fentynal patches for year and a half mcg I was needing a little more pain relief so the doctor was going to switch me to Butrans insurance wouldnt pay so he decided Belbuca Ive currently been on it for almost weeks I cant sleep more than an hour a day I have a massive headache all the time and my skin crawls like theres bugs under it almost Ive talk to the doctor he will not listen its not controlling the pain it wears off for hours before the next dose I cant hold food down and I have no desire to drink anything either
2795,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1,42949,38,Dealing with arthritis over years first ran the gamut of all the meds was lambasted when I suggested old fashioned pain meds Finally told nothing more rheumatology could do for me that I should try pain mgmt That equals opioid therapy was a godsend for me years now no problemsside effects take as prescribed rarely asked for increase I take as prescribed responsibly With the climate how it is today theres a stigma if you are on opioid therapy you are addicted BS After years if I was going to have problems they would have happened by now Belbuca IMO is using devious marketing ploys it does not work Maybe a minority but what about honest law abiding patients who benefit from opioids taking it responsibly
2799,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1,42865,42,I suffer from severe arthritis of hips and knees and they need to be replaced My Dr put me on belbuca along with my other pain meds and Im just gonna tell you belbuca is a joke Thanks to all you junkies out there people like me that suffer everyday from chronic pain literally are forced on this drug because all you crack heads want to get high You will eventually start trying to abuse this and they will ban it as well Because you find anyway to abuse something thanks to you all Think of this when you get hurt real bad and need pain meds and the Dr wont give you any because they dont make them anymore Think of that and I hope you finally see for your self but belbuca is a joke

2804,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,8,42792,42,My insurance is not covering Butrans patch anymore so my doctor started me on Belbeca mcg every hours I was concerned about it because of the negative reviews it received about its effectiveness and adhesive not staying put in the mouth I suffer with fibromyalgia and herniated discs in cervical thoracic and lumbar regions and sciatic nerve pain down to my foot I have not had issues with it sticking in my mouth I place a finger inside till it sticks and one outside my check if needed It stays put with no issues It has helped my pain better than the patch and Im taking less tramadol and zanaflex some days I dont need it Past few weeks I feel my pain is controlled Im not waking up in pain and feel alert to work

2834,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,2,42601,18,Ive just had my first dose so too soon to review its effectiveness It is very difficult to open the packaging and apply even after practicing with the trainer they provide This morning I found some things that helped me and I hope they might help others I cut past the suggested lines at least of an inch my shaky fingers barely got the first one open ha Instead of using my fingers I used tweezers to pick up and place the patch in my cheek Good luck to all
2835,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,3,42594,15,After years of chronic lower back pain and spinal fusion a year ago still experiencing chronic pain and now numbness and pain down both legs Doc started me on Belbuca a couple weeks ago at mcg and increased to mcg dose every hrs The little patch sure can be tricky to stick to the inside of my cheek The medication can be difficult to remove from the foil package but Im getting better at it My experience has been some pain relief without brain fog We will see how this goes I still have Percocet for break out pain Also its important to note that even after hrs the patch hasnt completely dissolved Im going to stick with it with the hope that it keeps more of my pain under control
2837,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,4,42576,17,I was prescribed Suboxone buprenorphine for chronic pain in When the patch Butrans came along I was given that but it itched too much Recently I moved to an area that virtually has no idea that buprenorphine is great for pain relief After much suffering I found someone who would prescribe it for such but my insurance also is behind the times and so after a few copays I heard about Belbuca so I tried it After a couple of doses I figured out the best way to open the pouch and for the most part it dissolved fine The problem is its just too weak The highest dose didnt cut it for me I gave it up and accepted the generic sublingual tablets of buprenorphine which are covered by my insurance They are fine
2838,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,8,42574,35,wow I cannot believe the negative comments well i was on many different medications i mean from oxycontin opana dilaudid u name it i been on it I have chronic back pain had surgeries I personal love the medication it works for me and as far as having nausea absoulety none at all Every one say they got nausea maybe u need to start out at a low dose I am on the highest dose and i love it yes the film does stick but its not bad to meso to anyone out there i suggest everyone is different and give it a try idk maybe it works best for different kinds of pain when i was on oxycontin now that made me nausea and felt like i couldt breathe

2975,Reclast,Osteoporosis,10,39535,240,I was given a minute infusion of Zolendronic Acid for post Menapausel Osteoporosis which I had had since I was diognosed with Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis and was taking large doses of Prednisilone and Imuran I started to have stress fractures in ribs and the Vertebrea and lost inches in height I was given all the Bisophosphates and had many episodes of reflux and had dreadful backpainI was asked by a British consultant to try Zolendronic Acid which I have found wonderful
2976,Tiagabine,Seizures,3,42940,0,Was sold this at my local GNC storename on bottle is GABA mg Clerk recommended when I mentioned that I have difficulty staying asleep as a natural supplement to help my brain stay quiet at night Worked for a couple weeks then symptoms became worse than ever so I stopped taking it
2977,Tiagabine,Seizures,3,42603,0,Controlled neural activity for a while but ended up being hallucinogenic thus it could no longer be used
2978,Tiagabine,Bipolar Disorde,10,41455,9,Immedietly stopped my mood swings one of the only mood stabilizers that helps me
2980,Alavert,Urticaria,10,41332,26,I have been taking this medication for years due to multiple allergies I TAKE IT AT NIGHT AS IT CAN CAUSE DROWSINESS ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY I HAVE NOT FOUND THIS TO BE A PROBLEM
2982,Vivelle,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,39967,46,Ive been Vivelle for at least years now HRT pills upset my stomach and were not as effective for me I tried the generic version of Vivelle but it was a much larger patch and did not stick as well The adhesive on the generic also gave me a rash Stick to the brand on this one would be my recommendation Im down to the lowest dose hopefully will be done completely in another year or so But this has saved my sanity and that of those around me
2983,Vivelle,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,39513,59,I have been on the Vivelle Dot for years after having my hysterectomy It is wonderful and has controlled my hotflashes night sweats breast tenderness and dry sking The Vivelle Dot is a much better drug for me than Premarin The Premarin was making my skin literally very dry and shrivel At first the Premarin was fine and after several years it started to have a very different effect on me causing pain during intercourse and very dry skin Changed to Vivelle Dot and all symptoms went away
2984,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Nasal Congestion,5,42978,1,Big mistake taking my first Claritin D at PM for sinus pressure from using a nasal decongestant the day before and getting a rebound effect of clogged breathing passages Didnt sleep a wink all night My nasal passages are wide open though so it works However insomnia is a real pain Its AM and I feel like it should be AM bedtime Ill be struggling through the day today Restless In Philly
2985,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Nasal Congestion,8,42364,5,I started this medication days ago due to post nasal drip phlegm coughs runny nose My doctor told me to take hour As far as side effects I experienced slight insomniaa little longer to fall asleep my head is not quite clear I feel a little foggy when I need to concentrate and a little fatigue No major side effects The medication has helped but has not completely quotcuredquot me So overall its worked but its not a miracle
2986,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Nasal Congestion,1,42251,6,Benadryl is WAYYYYY better Claritin does almost nothing for my allergies Would strongly suggest not wasting your money on this product
2987,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Allergic Rhinitis,10,41273,3,I have been taking this for my allergies for a few years now and LOVE IT The single daily dosage is great I have NO quotdowntimequot between doses However every year the supply runs out
2989,Claritin-D 24 Hour,Allergic Rhinitis,8,40070,12,Works great most of the time The problem is the price is going up and up The other problem is the restriction on the amount that can be purchased at one time I take one everyday but I can only buy at a time and only in a month Its hard to believe that the sale of the medicine has to be controlled On the last day of the month I have to wait until the next day to buy the med so stupid Especially when traveling and I cant purchase some in advance It should be prescription again so I can receive at one time
2990,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43078,2,I took this medicine for only days Itrsquos is the worse antibiotics I took my whole life If I could say anything it would be DONT EVER TRY IT You will feel almost dead After hours without this Irsquom feeling much better not but Donrsquot take this drug Itrsquos a poison
2991,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,43075,0,I have had many bladder infections in my lifetime and twice was prescribed nitrofurantoin Both times I took this medication I got a fever and was really lightheaded had bad diarrhea and was dehydrated severely probably because I had to force myself to eat and drink due to severe nausea on top of the diarrhea My bladder infection symptoms didnt improve eitherThe first time I took this medication I just assumed the symptoms were from my bladder infection getting worse and not improving Either way I ended up passing out at work and being taken by ambulance to the hospital for severe dehydrationThe second time I took the medicationafter I told my doctors it didnt work the first time and they convinced me to try it again same
2993,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,43072,0,I also have really bad nausea when taking these tablets try drinking peppermint tea I found it helped a wonder
2996,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,43068,3,Cant even explain how bad this made me feel SERIOUSLY thought I was dying ChillsSweating throwing upI actually passed out on my bathroom bath My chest pain was so bad I thought I was having a heart attack No desire to eatIve never had a problem with meds like this before in my life Never again I took it for days and stopped Be cautious
2997,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43065,1,Extreme drowsiness Never felt quite this drowsy from taking a medication Irsquom vomiting every hour or so I feel so sick I donrsquot even want to leave my bed It seems to be working for my UTI however so thatrsquos good Maybe itrsquos meant to flush your system out which is why most people puke Who knows
3000,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,43058,4,First Thank goodness I didnt read these reviews or I wouldnt have tried it Interesting that the side effects everyone is describing are the same side effects I had on Ciprofloxicin I was very worried taking this antibiotic because I lately dont do well Also I have gotten hives from Bactrim so I got nervous taking any antibiotic The difference this time Im eating yogurt and taking a probiotic so I wonder if that made a difference No pain at all in body no tiredness no dizziness I dont even feel like Im on a drug Im beginning to wonder if sometimes when we take these drugs it depends on our bodies at the time When I got hives from Bactrim and told the doctor she said I had been on it before Definitely eat yogurt and take probiotics
3001,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,43057,1,Had a painful UTI after about hours on the Nitrofurantoin the UTI wasnrsquot as intense I am extremely sensitive to medications and havenrsquot had much of an issue so far Mind you I drink about oz of water every day maybe that helpsHave had a little headache and I am sort of fatigued otherwise no issues
3002,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,43057,1,I was prescribed this to be taken times daily for days My UTI symptoms were gone by the first day I have now finished the course and my UTI is gone This medication worked great for the infection I did not experience any serious side effects except some tiredness spaced out feeling and on the nd day I did feel very down not sure if that was because of the medication However on the third day I feel fine
3003,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43051,2,I have been so ill for days I get sick a lot so I tried to brush it off but itrsquos to the point I was considering going to the hospital Irsquom vomiting so bad itrsquos painful I think about recently being prescribed this med and notice that oh itrsquos this damn pill that has me so violently ill Irsquom still vomiting violently thatrsquos not even right Omg someone save me lol also tired achy skin blisters feel off like speedy light headed Def no longer taking them
3004,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43050,1,Within hours I experienced muscle pain and spasms in my back and diarrhea Within hours I was experiencing respiratory issues shortening of breath and a nasty cough and the start of a yeast infection
3005,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,43049,1,Was given mg doses to take twice a day for days Irsquom only on my rd day taking these and Irsquom beyond miserable I wake up every night with unrelenting nausea fever and cold sweats The morning after my second day taking these I was admitted to the ER for the symptoms and was prescribed Pepcid antacid for all the excess stomach acids and zofran for the nausea The Pepcid helps a lot but the symptoms persist like I cannot get a good nights sleep due to the fever and cold sweats and initial nausea The zofran tastes so bad when dissolving that I cannot take it Alternatively I found that vaping or smoking small amounts of cannabis small dabs or bowls has helped calm the nausea enough for me to try and tough it out
3006,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43047,3,I was prescribed this for a UTI Took dose mg in the morning as directed and within hours was exhausted and lethargic Later that night I was experiencing chills woke up in a delirious fever like state exhaustion nausea cant eat severe joint pain everywhere especially in my spine and knees tightness in my lungs I feel like crying because the the show must go on and I feel like I have the flu Im hoping by tomorrow hours after dose I start to feel better Ive taken other antibiotics along with probiotics and never had a problem This is an awful feeling Seems like it works for others but must not mix with my body chemistry never again would rather take penicillin and deal with getting hives again
3009,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43025,4,Macrobid did nothing to eliminate my UTI It was a failure just like amoxicillian I was a bit nauseous at first but nothing that affected me I took it for ten days
3011,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,43017,3,I cant remember why I was prescribed this medication I do remember it was because I needed a strong antibiotic This medication caused me to bleed internally and have horrible diarrhea and subsequent dehydration within the first two days I took it I took it as directed and ensured I took it twice a day with meals I went to see my doctor the day after the adverse side effects began and he advised me to discontinue the medication immediately and to never take it again At the time May there wasnt much known about this medication nor its side effects
3013,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,7,43016,1,Macrodantin was prescribed to me to prevent UTI I only have to take one when needed During one month I got four fever attacks with chills headaches and muscle cramps Very much like flu symptoms It goes on for days then I am fine again Eventually I realised that it might be this medication since I took one on a Friday evening and the next day when I woke up I got this horrible symptoms again I read about the side effects and realised that this might be the cause
3014,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,43012,19,Awful medication I was only prescribed tablets to take and if Id read on here about them I would have stopped after the first Horrific headaches straight away constantly nausea so much so I could barely eat to take my next tablet drowsiness where Im bumbling about my flat constantly heat sweats skin sensitivity My neck is unbelievably sore making my headaches much worse
3016,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,43006,6,year old female I was not showing any signs of a UTI My doctor tested my urine and quotthought there maybe a possiblity of a UTIquot Therefore as a precaution I was prescribed mg twice a day for days I was extremely tired a bit dizzy at times mild headache Within hrs I had severe chills temp jumped up to sweated out all night Seem to be a bit better this morning temp returned to normal But still very tired and headache I felt better prior as I had NO symptoms Trying to stick it out for another days Sign
3018,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42996,11,This is a serious antibiotic I have never had such adverse sideeffects to a medication than I have with nitro I had a UTI that kept coming back for about month Doc finally put me on Nitro after cipro and everything else didnt work I am on day of a day dose and feel like I am dying I cant get a good rest My lungs feel congested but I cant cough up anything and my cough is dry I get panicky and frustrated very easily I have ZERO energy My hair is thinning I am freezing constantly Overall I feel like I am getting over the flu Unlike those who complain of diarrhea I have severe constipation I am only one day away from the end I just need to tough it out one more day
3019,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42992,9,I had a UTI not too long ago and I was prescribed Macrobid I did not have any crazy side effects Unfortunately I get them frequently and just started a new round of Macrobid and this time has been nothing but bad news I am on day of and I have been extremely nauseous dizzy and tired along with sharp abdominal pain The UTI isnt as severe anymore but I feel like it hasnt been as effective and that its still lingering I made sure to eat a decent meal before and drink plenty of water I think that its just not reacting well with my system I am definitely stopping after today and going to the doctor to figure out a new solution
3021,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42991,21,So Macrobid can certainly have some uncomfortable side effects Most of these are preventabletreatable with headache pills taking it with lots of food and probiotics If you are allergic that is not the fault of the medicine nor is it yours Thats just the way the cards were dealtMacrobid or nitrofurantoin is very good for UTI treatment and the methods it does so makes bacteria unlikely to build resistance to it Macrobid should be the first option before general antibiotics for this reasonMacrobid works very well and usually is taken twice daily breakfast dinner For me I had fatigue and headaches but they left after two days After that I felt fine for the remaining days And it worked
3025,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42978,11,I was prescribed this for a UTI and while it did help with that it ended up giving me the worst yeast infection of my life that I am still treating months later I usually dont have too much of an issue with antibiotics but this was awful
3026,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42977,7,Took this for a UTI that wouldnt let me eat for days got my appetite back although this pill took a little longer to clear it than others Ive been on The only noticeable side effect was neon yellow urine so that made it difficult to tell if I was hydrated enough I read how lots of other people have had a bad experience this pill helped me get back to work
3027,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42976,14,I was prescribed Microbid for a UTI that I had for about weeks I took pills so far mg each I have stomach issues so I took mine with vanilla yogurt and had no nausea or vomiting I highly suggest yogurt when taking antibiotics It works like a charm I have had no bad issues or side effects I already feel better after pills Give the medication a chance its working to kill bad bacteria which can make anyone feel yucky Good luck
3028,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42976,6,Alright so in terms of this medication it did its job One thing I know after having UTIs here and there on occasion that antibiotics are downright AGGRESSIVE Even with other antibiotics I had experience similar side effects But Id say for those who are not big on side effects this is not the greatest Everybodys bodies are different but in my case I had some of the side affects posted hard time sleeping soreness headaches oddly colored diarrhea you name it In general nitrofuranctoin means business and really buckle up for the side affects but it did the job for me and I saw improvement with my UTI in days so far on my th day and no UTI
3031,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42974,12,I had a bladder infection for the first time in my life and was prescribed this medication Worst experience of my life Immediately upon taking this medication I took food with it which is recommended I started experiencing a horrible panic attack followed by wheezing and coughing But that wasnt the worst of it I began feeling nauseous and started vomiting I threw up all the food I had eaten I felt like I had a severe case of food poisoning I had to stay in bed all day in case I vomited again Thankfully I didnt and I must admit that my UTI symptoms disappeared after that first pill but never again will I take this medicationI hope this helped
3033,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,3,42971,14,After having six UTIs in about months my urogyn put me on mg of Macrobid one every night After ten solid months of it I spent days in the hospital thought I was having a heart attack Turned out it was a pulmonary problem Heavy pressure in the chest shortness of breath and tingling around the lips Going back and researching Macrobid I found out that indeed long term usage can cause pulmonary problems I do think if works for short term usage
3034,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42966,9,Was prescribed days of trimethoprim for a UTI and they didnt touch it Im now on day of a day course of nitrafurantoin and I have had terrible diarrhea and stomach cramps My wee has also turned a bright yellow which Im concerned about since I thought it only turned dark yellow or brown on these tablets Anyway my UTI symptoms dont seem to have gotten any better
3035,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42966,12,Worse antibiotic I have ever taken This is the first time Ive ever take an antibiotic and felt worse than the infection
3039,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42956,9,I have a history of kidney infections and a new doc saw me as an emergency and gave me days worth of Nitro and days later I still felt rough so the doctor gave me a longer doseits two days since and I hurt EVERYWHERE I feel like my whole body is shaking and I have had hallucinations and nights sweats went to docs AGAIN just now and been prescribed a new antibiotic as he said that nitro has not worked and my fever is getting higher everyday Stupid pills
3041,Talacen,Pain,9,40976,12,I have rheumatoid arthritis and a few other bone and joint issues Docs have had me on all oxycodone Vicoden Percocet Tylenol None of them do anything to relieve my pain Dr put me on Talacen IT WORKS No side effects
3042,Talacen,Pain,8,39964,19,I have been using Talacen off and on for a year Used for arthritis pain in lower back neck and joints Only use when in severe pain I do not notice any of the side effects Works well for me
3043,Olux-E,Atopic Dermatitis,10,39895,16,I was prescribed OluxE for Psorisis of the scalp I made an appointment with a dermatologist because I was embarrassed by the flakes and condition of my scalp Symptoms were cut in half after two days of use and gone in four I can wear black again It still itches a bit but the flakes are gone Couldnt be happier It is a topical steroid so Im going to stop using and keep some on hand for the occasional flare upSo impressed THANK YOU
3045,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42907,9,Realised I had a UTI after waking up with the symptoms Im sure you all knowso decided to book an appointment as soon as possible First dose I had a bad headache and nausea but nothing unbearable and by the second dose my symptoms were starting to disappear less than hours after starting the medication Nausea is still there about hours after I take a pill but Im nearing the end of my course I understand that some people have bad reactions but in my experience this medication was great at relieving symptoms quickly and hopefully my UTI will be no more in a couple days
3047,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42907,11,I suffer from UTIS alot really severe The doctors give this tablet only when the infection is really high as its a hardcore one hence why they make you feel a little sleepy Just make sure you eat with each dose as if you dont it can cause sickness and tummy upsets not nicebut if you eat and do it right you will be fine and that horrible burning sensation will fade Complete your full course even if symptoms have stopped
3048,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42906,20,After reading so many horror stories I was terrified to take this But my UTI was unbearable so I decided there was no other option I have taken it with food and a few hours later I pop a few good probiotics I am on day and still have not experienced any of the awful symptoms described here I did notice a headache the first day and slight nausea but that went away once I ate My UTI symptoms diminished after hours and I am one happy camper Lesson learned the internet causes anxiety lol
3049,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42899,22,I took this drug after being prescribed it for a UTI I read some reviews after feeling a little weird but figured I would push through I called my doctor after taking two pills and the nurse told me to wait it out and see if it gets worse Things got worse very quick What began as a little bit of nausea ended with body aches leg cramps intense chills night sweats dizziness confusion to fainting twice terrifying to getting a vaginal infection because of this drugMy UTI symptoms have gotten better but the pain from my VI is unbearable and how I feel from this drug is terrible NOT worth itdo not take this drug PS I only got through taking FOUR pills out of my prescribed ten I am going to the doctor today again
3050,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42896,13,After having severe headache and vomiting with a sulfa drug I was put on Macrobid for my UTI I got a little headache after second dose but popped a Tylenol Also made sure I took my pills with food I was able to finish the full regimen and although the UTI took a bit longer to get kicked out the Macrobid worked It really wasnt bad at all to take I have many food allergies too and was able to tolerate Macrobid pretty well
3053,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42895,5,Ive had a few UTIs in the past and Ive always received other antibiotics even though I go to the same clinic They gave me Nitrofurantoin yesterday and after taking the first pill on an empty stomach I was tired after an hour but it didnt bother me at all I didnt have any headaches or nausea just the feeling of an empty stomach My boyfriend said I looked exhausted but I really felt fine Im on my period so I already have some ill feelings from that I just took my second pill this morning and it already feels better when I pee I definitely think this pill should be taken right after a meal because it is strong but it does what its supposed to do In order to prevent another UTI you need this
3056,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42893,16,Awful medicine the worst The side effects outweigh the benefit Headache the first night leg and back pain Sensitive skin just awful Pain got worse and worse I changed my meds to ciproflaxcin I have used this in the past so hopefully it will continue to help I even questioned the doc at urgent care to see if I can take cipro and she offered macrobid Maybe this urgent care and this medication is something they get a deal onstay away from macrobid
3057,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42891,19,I get UTIs pretty frequently so as soon as I felt the symptoms coming on I went to an urgent care The first day of macrobid I got a headache The second day I had severe headache body aches weakness and malaise However I thought it was just my illness because I have never had an experience like this with medication before Day I am in hell and sicker than a dog Severe headache nausea light headed weak fatigued I called in for Bactrim DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION I get that not everyone has this reaction but the risk is not worth it to me
3058,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42891,5,I was prescribed Macrobid nitrofurantoin after my UTI had not gone away with the first antibiotic It definitely took care of my UTI but the side effects were and are enough for me to never take this drug again While I took this I suffered from aches that moved all over nausea headaches my ribs almost felt bruised and it seemed to make my eyes get super tired at night as I was exhausted a lot of the time anyways I stopped taking it days ago and still have muscle aches and muscle tiredness and it still feels like my lungs are trying to recover from it too Im hoping by the end of the week all of these side effects are completely gone I was healthy aside from the UTI before I began taking this Definitely wouldnt recommend it
3059,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42888,12,I was scared out of my wits to take this antibiotic after reading these reviews but I am here to put your minds at ease Im highly allergic to penicillin amp NSAIDs Ibuprofen so I have wicked medication anxiety when it comes to taking anything new I had to take this for days amp I was warned when I received this medication that it would cause dizziness nausea upset stomach and loose stools Which is all I experienced with this pill On the first day I had nausea upset stomach amp diarrhea the second day I had nausea amp dizziness on the rd day I had nausea upset stomach amp diarrhea The every other day of symptoms pattern continued the whole time I took this Make sure you have a full stock of toilet paper at home Pill tastes nasty
3061,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42882,7,Lack of sleep problem sleeping lying down then falling into a void Anxiety Had NONE of these side affects before taking this medicine I slept soundly before
3062,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42881,8,Avoid this medication AT ALL COSTS Although it may not cause side effects for some I was one of the many unlucky ones who experienced terrible problems I have never had a problem with any antibiotics except Sulfa drugs before but this medication left me nauseated vomiting dealing with chills for hours shaking so hard I couldnt move and with a terrible headache I havent taken a dose in hours with my doctors suggestion and the headache is just now going away It took about hours for the shaking to stop At one point it was so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the ER I was only two doses in as well This was worse than the Sulfa reaction I had
3064,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42864,9,This drug put me in the ER last night Ive had UTIs before and have taken cipro etc without issue but yesterday I was prescribed Nitrofurantoin for the first time Approximately two hours after taking it I felt like I was going to throw up and shortly thereafter I became severely winded after climbing just one flight of stairs I sat on the floor trying to breathe for almost a full hour and just couldnt catch my breath Then I began shaking uncontrollably and was told I needed to go to the ER as they thought my windpipe was inflamed and closing up I arrived to the hospital visibly shaking my fever shot up and I spent several hours being monitored and given pills to counteract the Nitro before they let me leave Terrifying
3066,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42859,9,I was prescribed Nitrofurantoin in for chronic UTIs I took it daily for years In at age I began experiencing serious coughing episodes I had no known allergies and no known respiratory issues I went to Health Centre After multiple tests I was diagnosed with Interstitial Lung Disease When I told the doctors about my history of taking Nitrofurantoin for UTIs they informed me that one of the side affects of this medication is respiratory problems They also informed me that anyone should not take nitrofurantoin for an extended period years Therefore they concluded that my lung disease was the direct result of taking Nitrofurantoin for an unreasonable period of time
3068,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42858,8,Been on and off this Medication for two years seems to help a great deal Im back on it due to urinary tract infection again seems since Ive turned I keep getting them Seen an Urologist two weeks ago and was told to keep taking this for the next four months
3070,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42856,9,I took this medication for a UTI Started on a Friday Its now Monday and I was told by my gyno office to stop They told me the side effects I was experiencing were not normal for the medication Have to head to the hospital to see whats up Here is what I experienced Constant nausea Headaches Weak muscles and stiff joints Blurry vision Made it hard to walk up and down stairs started to gag if I moved too quickly Tired Oh so tired If it is the medication then this is awful The side effects are worse than the UTI Ive never had a problem with any other antibiotic medication
3071,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42855,4,Experienced UTI symptoms Doc prescribed Sulfameth on pending results of culture Sulfameth barely nicked the symptoms Started Nitrofurantoin tablets daily one in the morning one at night Seemed to be working with no appreciable side effects Take with food lots of water Have been pushing water for days now Nitrofurantoin ran out on a Tuesday By Saturday night symptoms came roaring back Spent several hours crying in pain This drug ineffectual for me
3072,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42855,30,Had abdominal discomfort burning sensation and blood after urination Urgent care diagnosed me with an UTI They prescribed this for me and after taking one pill my symptoms started to subside I have only experienced slight headache but no other significant side affects My urine however did turn a different kind of yellow but when looking at the packaging this is normal and doesnt warrant concern Great antibiotic
3073,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42853,9,I know this is about nitrofurantoin but I wanted to talk about the other drug I took before Last week I noticed I had a UTI so I called my GP for an appointment they tested a sample and said there was some sort of urine infection so they prescribed me Trimethoprim which I had taken previously before day course this time the drug did not work at all if anything it made me worse this also included vomiting so I called the GP very early this morning and was seen within hours I told them my symptoms and what had happened so I sent off a sample and they prescribed me nitrofurantoin mg capsules for days Ive taken doeses today I have pills a day and I can honestly say it has already started to work
3074,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42849,21,It works great I was prescribed it to prevent UTIs after sex However my urologist took me off this medication because it can cause pulomonary fibrosis Which is a serious lung condition that can be fatal Please reconsider taking this medication There are other options Seek help from a urologist for further workup and treatment
3077,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42845,40,After being prescribed Monurol a single dose powder satchet antibiotic for a pretty nasty Bladder Infection I had to go back to the doctor because I was still in serious pain My family doctor prescribed Macrobid and after taking ONE dose I started to have relief Im pretty sensitive to medications I usually get the full list of sideeffects headache nausea diarrhoea but with Macrobid absolutely nothingnot even the weird possible quotdarkening of urinequot Believe me Im a big baby Id whine about anything this medication was amazing
3079,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42837,42,Before your freak out thinking that youre gonna have the worst experience ever on this drug dont Most people who have good experiences dont come to these sites and write reviews its always the bad ones I have terrible health anxiety and Im sensitive to lots of drugs I also had C diff months ago cured by at home Fecal Microbiota Transplantation so taking an antibiotic again was pretty scary for me The side effects I got were a slight headache and nausea for a couple hours after each pill some gas but no other digestive issues thank goodness I was feeling better on the th day and have one more day to go Take it with bread to make it easier on your stomach
3080,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42830,18,I was experiencing back to back UTIs for months After trying some alternative approaches with my doctor considering surgery she decided to put me on a daily low dose antibiotic Macrodantin It has been over three plus months and it works I honestly am not comfortable taking a daily antiobiotic but I am far more uncomfortable having a UTI No side effects for me
3082,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42817,17,I have been taking these tablets for days now amp Im amazed how quickly my symptoms cleared up st tablets in the morning amp at night I was able to go to the toilet with no pain at all Ive had another tablets today amp finish my course tomorrow all with no side affects at all Im just very relieved to be able to pee again without the horrid pain If i happen to get another UTI then I will definitely take this medication it works wonders
3083,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42816,10,Ive taken antibiotics many times before in my life but with nitrofurantoin I experienced really bad headaches after day one Quit taking them for hrs headache cleared rapidly then recommenced coursesame againvery bad headaches energy loss feeling very weak and nauseous have ceased now and feel better again Now I just have to clear up my UTI Yes reaction to antibiotic far worse than UTI Be wary of this one though everyones different
3084,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42815,7,Tested positive for UTI and was put on nitrofurantoin mg x per day for days No problems the first day evening of second day I started with a frequent dry cough not quite hacking but close Only able to sleep hours per night and coughing got worse each day Called clinic on th day and changed to Bactrim for days No burning some pressure and frequent urge to urinateGoing to doctor for regular checkup today and will discuss this but will not take this medicine again
3085,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42811,13,I was prescribed mg x daily for days I noticed my bowels were unusual more watery Also headaches were common as well Not terrible but annoying My UTI did in fact go away I recently have been having reoccurring UTIs with not being treated This was my first treatment for my UTI Im hoping they no longer continue to frequently occur So overall it gets the job done with very manageable side effects
3087,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42804,11,I was a bit scared to take this due to a bad experience years ago but the doctor said its the only anti biotic that will get rid of my current bacteria First hour I took it I was nauseous but I kept myself distracted and its been a few hours and the nauseous has gone The best thing is to drink a lot of water and eat well even if u dont have the appetite Its only been a few hours so my symptoms are still there but Im feeling quite positive that Ill be back to normal in the next couple days due to how strong this anti biotic is
3088,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42801,7,I used to have recurrent UTIs and had no problems with other antibiotics I hadnt had one in around months but am in week of my second pregnancy and theyve returned I was given nitrofurantoin mg times per day The first and second dose made me incredibly nauseous all day delirious and with a fever but freezing hands and feet The rd and th mild nausea Im on day and there are still mild cystitis symptoms and again the st dose in the morning made me nauseous and delirious Im too sick to leave the house to change my medication and have had to miss work but I will definitely be asking for something else if ever prescribed this again
3089,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,3,42800,8,I was prescribed a low dose of it for prevention if UTIs and it gave me diarrheawhich for someone already dealing with IBS Im on top of constant UTIsis not helpful at all Aside from that no side effects Still stopped taking it though and was prescribed methenamine hope it works
3090,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42799,11,Never taking this again Day of taking this antibiotic for UTI and I have never felt so ill Constant feeling of vomiting bloating and loss of appetite I rather have UTI than these symptoms Horrible
3091,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42798,46,My dr wanted to give me Cipro or Bactrim but since I have a pill complex I asked for something smaller He prescribed Macrobid and I came to this site to apparently scare myself before taking it Well Im here to tell you that this antibiotic was GREAT As someone who has colitis and constant headaches both triggered by virtually anything neither were affected by this drug I experienced zero side effects I took mg twice a day for days I would take capsule right after breakfast and capsule right after dinner so it was always accompanying a meal days later urine culture came back negative This worked great for me I didnt start feeling pain relief til day though Hang in there and take with meals
3092,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,42797,8,Ive taken two doses after my gall baldder surgery The first one left my lips swollen and a bit numb In about hour my face felt hot and looked flushed I felt tingling in my legs The second time I took it which was today after hr I felt my face really flushed again and it was red My chest broke out in a rash Now I feel flu like symptoms and I have a slight fever I feel aches all over Im calling my doctor on Monday to change antibiotics Im not taking this anymore
3093,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42797,5,Been taking nitrofurantoin for a little less than hrs and already I feel anxious nauseous and heavy depression But to be fair I havent been taking them with food in me considering I have a loss of appetite due to my UTI This is my second UTI and I dont remember me having severe side effects like the ones Im experiencing with this pill Im gonna give it another day and if my symptoms dont get better then Ill be calling in for another prescription
3095,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42950,2,I love this drug A previous horrible experience with Cipro severe diarrhea dizziness lethargy extreme weight loss and an inability to digest any of my normal foods for about years left me really afraid of the consequences of taking antibiotics again I went in to the dr refusing to take Cipro again He gave me nitrofurantoin I had NO side effects NO stomach upset NO problems whatsoever I just felt better within a day I will say that I did need to take a second day course to fully rid me of the infection but it was so easy that I did not really care If I need this drug again I will ask for a longer course next time And it is CHEAP
3096,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,42950,29,Please please please dont use this drug Was put on it for a bladder infection that I didnt even know I had and have been nothing but miserable When I first started taking it mg twice a day I noticed that I had severe nausea even though I took it with food Then body pains and head pains came My head would feel so heavy that I could barely hold it up and my ears felt as if they were full of fluid Then came the vision problems and trouble balancing and basically walking I had to take time off work because I have been have a mental breakdown because of this drug I am constantly crying or in full on panic attacks I feel like any day could be my last Please dont take this pill its not worth it Im praying this wont be forever
3097,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42948,9,The day after I started taking this I started having major leakage and had no warning I also had diarrhea but thought it was something I ate I have been off of it for days and still peeing while I sleep while I walk Its annoying Plus I still have the UTI Not a fan of this medication
3106,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42935,24,EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT I had a great experience with Macrobid I am actually allergic to a few meds so I was relieved to have one for a mean UTI I got over the last few days I actually started taking it Macrobid MG twice daily for days BEFORE coming to this site to read the reviews Firstly it says to take it with food or milk so many probably didnt follow those directions bc it will give you nauseavomiting if you dont The only side effect Ive had is drowsiness But my doctor also prescribed me with metronidazole mg taken twice daily WITH the Macrobid to offset symptoms that can bring on a yeast infection etc I only get UTIs once or twice a year but this one reared its ugly head and Macrobid worked wonders for me
3110,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42929,13,Before I started my antibiotic course of nitro I read all the reviews online about it and was terrified to take it But after being on Bactrim and cipro and neither clearing up my infection I was equally scared my infection would never go away so I took nitro anyway and was expecting to have terrible side effects However after just pills I noticed my infection was FINALLY going away I am so happy The only side effects I have is muscle aches Just remember side effects are temporary guys I am grateful for this antibiotic so far
3111,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42928,11,I was given this medicine for the nd time yesterday I have had it before no issues but this time not the case I took my first dose at night and this morning my feet and hands are burning and itchy I keep rubbing the bottom of my feet under my desk to see if it will stop I am dizzy headache and my pain is actually worse I get UTIs all the time and usually use other meds but the CVS Minute clinic gives this one for some reason I will NOT be taking anymore and will be going back to get a different medicine
3112,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42924,15,I took Macrobid a few months ago for my UTI Worked great No side effects This time after getting a UTI again I was prescribed Macrobid again but this time Im getting all the side effects Fever chill body aches fatigue nauseated etc etc I will probably stop using it now My UTI does feel a bit better though
3113,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42923,7,MOST people who write reviews here are those who have had negative experiences which can all scare you away from taking a medication so I decided to write a positive one for a change Id had symptoms of a UTIbladder infection for several weeks and all my urine tests came up negative for UTI but my MD decided to put me on this anyway based on my symptoms Id never taken it before amp Im VERY leery of taking new meds but I didnt have any real problems with it I had some mild wooziness and headache the first day and that was it no other side effects However Im only giving it an because it doesnt feel like it completely got rid of my symptoms
3114,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42921,11,Before starting on this drug I was going through a nasty cycle of UTIs amp thrush I would get a UTI due to intercourse amp after taking antibiotics to treat it I would then develop thrush The cycle happened about or times over the course of a year even though my husband amp I were taking every preventative measure possible and following drs advice wash before and after pee within minutes drink lots of water etc I even saw a urologist to try amp get to the bottom of it I couldnt break the cycle until I was prescribed this I dont take it daily after we have had intercourse I take one as a preventative Since starting this medication I have not had one UTI I have no side effects It has greatly improved my quality of life
3115,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42916,17,This is the third antibiotic in weeks used for a UTI Yes the drug has been effective in healing the infection However It would not be my st choice Ive had muscle pain in my legs and feetExhaustion Insomniagrotesque nightmares Weakness unsteadiness walking Nausea dry mouth with a taste of metal in my mouth
3116,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42916,13,Macrobid immediately helps get rid of my UTIs and I am prone to very bad ones because of some preexisting conditions Once on a trip I happened to luckily have a spare one floating around in my toiletries that I took when I realized that I had developed a UTI and in spite of not having a full regime it still got rid of it HOWEVER I do have an EXTREME reaction to Macrobid It gives me the most EXCRUCIATING body pains a couple hours after taking it The best way that I can describe it is like acid in my veins or my nerves spasming nonstop I vomit cry and cant even stand bend or roll over in bed without exacerbating the pain making me nonfunctional After about hours it goes away but it is awful until then
3117,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42911,6,I was prescribed pills for a bladder infection I got after a surgery I took the first dose pill on Friday evening Everything seemed fine until Saturday afternoon By this time I had taken pills A severe headache settled in so I took some Tylenol I started to noticed I was getting really gassy The medicine also started working at this point It was no longer painful urinating the entire time but rather only as the bladder became empty Took my rd pill and went to bed Woke up around am feeling like I had the flu Skin was hot body aches and I had chills Headache was also back ten fold Now the gas has turned into painful gas cramps I wont be taking more until I talk to my doc Monday morning
3121,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42793,24,I started Macrobid yesterday and I felt okay but today Ive had the most horrible painful stomach cramps and the weirdest constipated diarrhea I have ever had I am constantly feeling like I need to throw up and the bowel movements and pain are what prompted me to do some Internet digging I have taken four of mg pills in two days and I refuse to take another At work today I nearly tripped several times and I was disoriented felt sick and had difficulty walking straight There are other meds out there and while I know that everyone reacts differently to medication I seriously would not wish this stomachabdominal pain on anyone it is incessant and keeping me from sleeping I pray for alleviation tomorrow but fear it may take a few days
3122,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42793,44,Please dont be scared to take this medication I read the reviews and was horrified but honestly the drug was very tolerable I went through other medications for UTI before I was prescribed this one First it was Bactrim which a few hours after taking rd dose I got hives Second was Ciprofloxacin Hcl mg and I ended up with tendinitis in both legs Thirdly is Macrobid mg x a day for days My advice is to take it with a full meal Only side effects I get is slight drowsiness and nausea close to the hours mark of my next dose Eat large meals before taking Macrobid and then snack throughout the day and drink lots of fluids Youll be ok
3124,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42788,6,My first day of being prescribed with the medicine I thought everything will be ok I took my first pill at pm at night when I finally got home from work everything seemed fine However at am I started getting serious abdominal pain and couldnt go to sleep I started throwing up and had diarrhea my body was so weak that I started crawling on the floor This have to be the worst pain ever and I refuse to take it again
3125,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42783,21,After days on Cipro my UTI did not clear up Pressure frequent urination and passing gas through my vagina yesFrontal fartingAnyone else have this Im on my th day of Macrobid and have not had any unpleasant side effectsJust some loose BM and gas
3126,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42783,15,I went to the ER and they determined I didnt exactly have a UTI but it was a possibility so they started me on Macrobid I had never taken it before Within two days I was hysterical I had such intense migraines that I fell multiple times and couldnt see straight My stomach was a mess I couldnt go to the bathroom I wanted to sleep but I couldnt fall asleep because my head was pounding too hard I called my PCP who checked the ER records and told me I had never had a UTI to begin with and to stop the Macrobid ASAP Once I stopped it the migraines went away I stopped falling my gastrointestinal system has now days later returned to normal
3127,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42783,14,Only hours after taking this medication for a UTI I had severe pain in my chest I thought it was gas and it wasnt until day four of having extreme shortness of breath and lethargy I decided to research what the side effects of this medication are It looks like many other people have experienced breathing issues as well from taking this I am stopping it asap and never taking it again
3128,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42779,4,Horrible horrible horrible I was prescribed this as I interact with most antibiotics It got rid of my UTI but I was sick had a degree temperature major shakes I still feel lethargic and sick so for me the cons outweigh the pros I did finish complete the course as it was only for three days had it been a seven day course I would have stopped taking them
3130,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42776,44,Both extremes of Macrobid are accurate Ive had a lot of UTIs to the point of having Macrobid prescribed with refills as needed I never experienced any symptoms and this stuff was like a miracle Took hrs to kick in and felt great I didnt get a UTI for years and then just got one I took Macrobid and it has made me feel horrible I feel weak have no energy am always dizzy have headaches diarrhea bad pain around my lymph nodes and always feel like I need to throw up Fortunately Im a sahm stay at home mom so Im able to deal with it at home but I had to have someone take my child to school because I couldnt get out of bed Also it feels like it hasnt completely started working So it can be great and horrible even with the same person
3131,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42776,3,My experience was HORRIBLE I was prescribed this medication for a UTI minutes after taking the first dose my mood changed for the worst I became extremely irritable and suddenly super hungry My appetite eventually went away completely but my irritability did not I went into a psychotic rage at one point when my mom was yelling for no reasonlike always typical mom and was provoking me and hadnt seen my texts of me telling her I was having a bad reaction so she didnt know Then before bed I felt like I was deathly ill my body was aching major headache chills racing heart I have anxiety so this medication caused my heart to race even more I then began crying uncontrollably and felt overwhelmingly sad Never taking again
3133,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42775,5,First off I have a history of having UTI This past one has been a real doozy and the medication was changed four times The last antibiotic prescribed is macrobid mg xday The first day I was nauseated and delirious with bad nightmares It was a sick flu like feeling along with bad chills I kept taking them as I thought what else This sick feeling calmed by third day and two more pills left I feel better but my bladder has been through too much with so many infections with wrong medications I really wish my Dr would focus more on preventionMacrobid definitely gave me bad side effects compared to any other antibioticsbut it seemed to clear the infection hopefully it doesnt return
3134,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,4,42773,16,Started nifurantoin on Friday After fifth dose started headache chills flu like symptoms Then severe low back pain and I thought this moved to my kidneys Took two more doses and went to my Dr on Monday with insane low back pain and joint pain down my body I thought maybe I had the flu When I told the nurse my symptoms she said quotits the medication your urine shows no infection now quot Dr confirmed and changed the medicine after telling me her patients that react this way look and feel like they have the flu Today is day five and I still have bad low back pain I wonder how long it will last because its horrible Drs should warn their patients
3138,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42770,2,Just taken of tabs really dont think can face another day feeling like death Husband woke me in the night to check temperature said I was panting He does not normally panic Cant eat If I sweat it stinks presumably of chemicals Splitting headache Extreme lethargy Basically went to bed and slept as much as I could Terrible stomach cramps belching and wind Best of all I dont even know if this drug is the correct one for me as lab results not back until Monday Never again for me
3139,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42767,4,Had ORANGE urine from to Went to Dr Got urinealysis They said it was fine and call them if it comes back It did every days or so for weeks Went back to the dr Got blood work and another urinalysis My blood is fine She said I have bacteria in the urine tho called it a UTI and put me on this medicine Only took doses so far and have no side effects but I urinated orange again twice today So Im wondering if it should be working by now And also like the other stories Im hearing from you ladies I have NO other symptoms Zero Has anyone had a UTI with no other symptoms Maybe its not a UTI And also has anyone ever had this orange urine but me When its not orange its fluorescent yellow
3140,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42761,8,years old and developed UTI after flu On the medicine for just days and will stopDeveloped scary pounding heart beat Need to stay around a while longer to see younger daughter wed
3141,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42760,7,I love this drug I have chronic UTIs I get them at least once a month the first time taking this medication I felt better within a day I did feel a little sick to my stomach but I would much rather feel a little nauseous than having the burning sensation and constantly needing to Pee every seconds I currently have a UTI now and I took with food and have not felt sick to my stomach whatsoever this medicine is a lifesaver
3142,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42760,6,I was instantly sick to my stomach after first dose Now I wonder if it was just exhaustion from being up all night with the PAIN I am on day and feel so much better that I may be back at work in the morning I havent had a UTI since I was very young and sort of forgot how dreadful it can get My Dr said usually hrs and one is over the worst and I think the side effects for me are extremely minimal
3144,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42758,6,Although I think I might have kidney stones instead of a UTI due to vast amounts of blood in my urine and no pain when I urinate my only side effect is nausea I cant say if it actually helped with symptoms because I still have side and belly pain after days of being on it Just because one person might have one side effect or allergic reaction doesnt mean the next person will Everyones body is different and what doesnt work for one person might work for the other
3145,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42755,5,I will NEVER touch this medicine again A couple hours after my first dose I started to feel nauseated Things quickly devolved from there Severe chills body aches fever splitting headache Like when you first get the flu X My skin hurt and I couldnt relieve my paindiscomfort in any way The next hours waiting for the drug to leave my system were a complete nightmare
3149,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,4,42748,9,Ive never reacted to any antibiotic so I had no idea what I was in for with this I made the mistake this morning day of taking pill I had no appetite yesterday and was very lethargic and agitated Really out of sorts but functioning Today has been a nightmare of nausea chills body aches and joint pain exhaustion headache ear and jaw pain etc Thats not the full list Doc pulled me off and moved me to Augmentin but I have a LOT going on the next days and I came here hoping to figure out how long it will be before the side effects are gone I cant get anything down nothing helps the pain Im essentially useless Also hasnt anyone heard of Pyridium You dont need to suffer OTC and numbs urinary tract
3150,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42746,16,Ive had a few UTIs recently and the antibiotics has worked every time but this time I was prescribed Macrobid and after one pill I felt pretty horrendous The symptoms of my UTI went away but it was replaced with really scary symptoms I took the second pill not thinking it was side effects considering Ive never had a bad experience with an antibiotic but woke up during the night feeling like my breathing was so heavy I wasnt sure if Id need to go to hospital The headache was unreal I ached all over and walked about feeling like I was going to fall down any minute and like I was drunk or something Called the doctor who told me to get an antihistamine and not take another I felt poisoned Still not fully recovered
3151,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42743,10,I suffer from recurring UTIs Its not uncommon with post menopausal women who are still sexually active This drug has been amazing Taking one directly after intimacy can prevent the UTI from occurring but when it does I feel relief after the first dose and in a few days its gone Since Im allergic to the standard treatment of sulfa based drugs Im grateful to have this Keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to any medication While one person tolerates it well another cant So dont dismiss it without trying I have never had the slightest side effect with nitrofurantoin
3152,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42742,19,It says ON THE BOTTLE to take this medicine with food This is probably why you are experiencing nausea and fatigue Its a great medicine and a great alternative and preventative if youre like me and suffer from chronic UTIs
3153,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42738,22,It has been my personal experience in dealing with urinary tract infections that Macrobid is a godsend After having my youngest child I came down with a UTI which stemmed from the birthing unit nurse improperly inserting a catheter prior to my cesarean section delivery Within about a week I began noticing some tenderness in my lower pelvic area but thought perhaps it was because I had a tubal ligation and c section and returned to work upon my discharge from the hospital yeah not the most health wise move but childbirth doesnt stop the bills from flowing in I was put on antibiotics that didnt work ended up admitted with severly infected kidneys and macrobid was the only thing that cured me and to this day is the only antibiotic that works for my UTIs
3155,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42737,7,On Christmas Eve I felt as though a UTI was starting and took Trimethoprim which I had ordered from an online Dr It seemed to dampen the symptoms but didnt get rid of them completely I was prescribed nitrofurantoin on New Years Day I was in a lot of pain Started taking the pills at am and had three doses during the day plus nurofen No improvement during that day but I slept well and woke up the following day today with very little pain Symptoms not completely gone but vastly improved No noticeable side effects Am taking the antibiotics with food as advised I give it a rather than because it has worked a little more slowly than treatments I have had in the past but I am not complaining
3156,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42737,4,Ive taken exactly pills and I will not take one more no fever or chills but I have a rash all over my body I have never been allergic to anything in my life and now this rash is horrible back legs arms stomach Its itchy and just plain annoying Also my urine had cleared up before taking these pills now its back to a very dark color I am not taking another pill as for my UTI I will try some parsley tea and see where that gets me
3157,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42736,20,I used to have many UTIs a year but no more with this drug I have taken it every day for years and have never had a sideeffect Sorry for those who do
3159,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42733,30,I have a history of UTIs and kidney infections because my urethra is abnormal However with every UTI i have been prescribed several different antibiotics None that are accompanied by side effects but every person is different With every UTI I have had I have always experienced head ache nausea body aches and fever All went away with the UTI When I asked my doctor he said the antibiotics take between and hours to start taking effect on your body You may be experiencing some effects of your infection
3160,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42731,23,I am only taking the time to write this review because I see so many negative ones Id hate to see someone not take it and risk an infection getting worse This drug does work cleared up my UTI in days There are some not pleasant side effects Nausea Ive been feeling this one all week body ache and chills only on the first day In my unique case Id take any pain in the world over having a strong urge to use the restroom every seconds and intense burning Ive taken this drug once before and felt fine Talk to the dr if youre concerned there are other medications out there
3162,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,42725,11,Effectively killed bacteria but I had an extreme adverse reaction to the antibioticfever of headache body pains sore red rash on calves Adverse reaction developed after about days of taking medication the first time Adverse reaction developed several hours after taking st dose of medication the second time it was prescribed for me
3163,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42724,10,I was prescribed macrobid mg two times a day for days for a pretty severe UTI The first day I took it I felt like I had a fever and I had chills and body aches I figured it was just my UTI causing the symptoms Today I am on day last day and I am going to the doctors for a different medication because after taking one of the pills last night I developed what I thought was the flu severe body aches fever chills I really considered going to the ER cause I was that sick Woke up this morning feeling better then last night but I refuse to take another pill As far as cleaning up my UTI some days I have felt normal and other days I still have the burning and frequency
3164,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42723,29,Macrobid cleared up my UTI in only days I was afraid to use it based on the comments on this site but keep in mind most people who take time out to comment are those with negative experiences Usually people with great experiences like myself dont take time out to talk about how well a medication worksthey use it and go on with their daily lives Its been over a year now and no reoccurrence of UTI I had zero side effects
3166,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42722,3,After being in SEVERE pain on passing and after passing urine saw my GP who prescribed nitrofurantoin as Im resistant to the preferred prescribed Trimethropin After doses of mg same evening I woke in the night feeling like a total zombie felt like I could barely move or breath like I was almost comatose Carried on the next day tho as felt I would put this down to the infection in my body urine dip showed something I took every hours and feel snappy and lethargic but my main worry is the feeling of a fluttering racing heartbeat and pressure rising into my head I have felt a little short of breath too as if cant quite breath in Bladder still feeling sensitive and urgent even tho finished course earlier today
3168,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42716,11,The reviews on this site scared me so much so that I almost didnt take this prescription Ive only taken two doses so far and both times I took it with food but I have nothing strange to report No drowsiness no racing heart no headaches and I might add that headachesmigraines are very common for me Im already staring to feel some relief from my UTI symptoms I know everyone is different but Ive not experienced anything out of the ordinary this far
3170,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42713,8,I know a lot of people seem to have quite bad side effects however this was not the case with me I had been suffering so bad from a severe UTI went to the docs and got a prescription I took my first dose at am around pm that same day my severe symptoms were now non existent I continued taking the medication for days in total which is what my doctor advised and didnt have one side effect Maybe Im lucky but honestly this medication worked perfectly for me

3193,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42674,13,If I had seen this site before taking Nitro Id have chosen to avoid it However Im glad I didnt I get UTIs without fail every time I have sex sometimes I just got them for the sake of getting them or drinking too many fizzy drinks it got to the point it was almost constant I thought I was just cursed and that there was no escape and was debating urethral dilation with my Urologist However he recommend I try this before going any further It has changed my life I have no side effects and am free of UTIs as long as I take a pill post coitus the hassle of doing so doesnt phase me as it is nice to be able to enjoy my life with no risk of UTIs I recommend this to everyone who struggled like I did
3194,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42673,11,I was on holiday and prescribed these by the Dr at the walk in centre after a week I still have faint burning still urinating frequently coldflu symptoms headaches I rarely suffer with headaches sharp pains in my stomach and still feeling sick even after not taking them for days Back to my own Drs tomorrow This drug is horrid
3196,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42666,2,I have been talking nitrofurantoin for days and I have a severe stiff neck Is this normal
3197,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42665,10,I went to the doctor because of a slight UTI yesterday I took one dose of the medicine last night and felt nauseous and developed the worst migraine I felt it all in my face and neck I took extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep I woke up this morning perfectly fine and it was time for my nd dose in less than an hour I was soooo nauseous and weak and it feels like I have a lump in my throat This feeling keeps coming and going I called off from work because Im afraid if I start moving too much then I might pass out or throw up I normally never get side effects from medication but this one is different I dont recommend it at all
3198,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42664,25,I was diagnosed with a UTI and kidney infections They started me on Macrobid two days ago and yes death on a doornail set in When your body utilizes this drug to flush your system it doesnt just run to your bladder and ta da Your body handles this infection with all its defenses so you SHOULD expect to feel really icky for about a week I am floored at todays rush in society to get everything done right now or right away Every body needs time to heal and recover Allow yourself the precious gift of rest and recuperating it needs and unless you begin to spike fever or experience allergic reaction hang in there and know its okay to take some time off to nurture you
3199,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42664,16,I dont know why this medication gets such terrible reviews Im taking mg twice a day yellow and black pills second time theyve been prescribed to me and Ive never had troubles Mild gas mild urgency to use the restroom but nothing insane like heart racing or sweating I slept like a baby after I took my first one and Im about to take my second before my bed time now I honestly didnt know I had a UTI till my doctor told me but this is my second time and these pills have never given me an issue Take them as instructed with food stay hydrated too this medication works wonders Antibiotics are some of the only drugs I take as I believe in holistic approaches but this is one that makes me happy when I do have to take drugs
3200,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42663,18,The first time I used this medication it was great Just now I was prescribed Macrobid again It took care of the bladder infection symptoms in two days Next day fever was l headache Fever high only one day nausea fatigue high pulse stomach pain neck pain muscle pain lack of appetite Stopped taking this med after days and will never take it again
3202,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42659,22,I have suffered from frequent bouts of acute cystitis which have had me sitting on the toilet for hours in the middle of the night in tears The only thing which works to clear the infection is nitrofurantoin i find it works quickly and have never experienced any side effects other than my urine going slightly more bright yellowI am writing this because the other reviews are very negetive and could easily stop people taking this drug if i had read them i would probably not have taken the medication i do not doubt that some people suffer very bad side affects but that applies to all medication i would like to say that i really depend on this drug to cure my cystitis which would otherwise make my life very miserabletry them
3203,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42659,14,I have taken this on occasions over the last four years mg times a day for days and was scared to take it on each occasion after reading some of the reviews form others I also have a phobia of taking medicine which made me more anxious then mostI have always ended up taking it eventually because my symptoms worsened and would like to report I had zero side effects and felt better within days I also think that some of the reported side effects others have mentioned maybe the actual infection itself as I have left my infections for up to weeks without treatment and had the symptoms others have mentioned without me having taken the medicine
3204,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42659,5,After days out of twice a day I quit taking it for two days and then resumed once a day I had developed severe lethargy and dizziness and red splotches on my hands Weakness disappeared within a day but then returned when I resumed There must be an alternative out there
3208,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42655,16,I woke up feeling a nasty burning sensation so I went to the walk in clinic today to be prescribed with macrobin I must say in the first hour after taking it my extreme pain and irritation was gone but as time went by I started to feel like I was going through chemotherapy Only one pill and I feel extreme side effects I wear corrective lenses and my vision is getting all messed up My body is super weak my heart beats very fast my stomach is in knots my abdomen is cramping up like nobodys business I have a headache Never ever taking this again I would not recommend this antibiotic to anyone Yes everyone is different therefore you will react differently to antibiotics but this one is absolute agony
3209,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42654,8,This was prescribed to me a couple of days ago by a doctor for a suspected urinary infection as due to being pregnant i cannot take the usual antibiotic that would be prescribed ITS HORRIBLE I wish i had never taken it and have spent the last hrs tired and sick with nausea passing out diarhea blurry vision my body feels sick and poisoned I have no idea whats in this but its terrible and hasnt helped at all I am having shortness of breath just moving around is such a struggle Have stopped taking and will be going back to doc for something alternative when i can get up and actually get there safely without passing out Will never take this again

3211,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42652,11,I had a minor UTI I just couldnt seem to clear it out of my system so I got prescribed with Macrobid The first day I took it I felt a little drowsy but nothing major The second day dose two I began to feel very drained and had no energy I thought maybe I just needed sleep so I tried to nap but I just lay there in discomfort and exhaustion I began to have cold flu symptoms I became very dizzy and nauseous I felt like I was spinning I was bed ridden and cried from how bad I was feeling It did help my UTI symptoms but I am not sure if its worth it
3212,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42651,4,Had a mild UTI and was prescribed this drug I had no problem with the first dose and was feeling better by the second dose I took both with food Shortly after the second I was feeling dizzy and unwell Within a few hours I was severely nauseous and vomited I looked up side effects and read these reviews Although the drug did work quickly I chose to call my Urgent Care doctor and she prescribed a different drug Hope that one gets rid of the problem with fewer side effects
3213,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42648,21,I cannot overstate how much I despise this medication It may be effective in getting rid of bladder infections but I never got that far I used this medication twice I gave it a second go thinking my previous experience mightve been an anomaly Wrong Within days each time I had severe flulike symptoms They included chills mild fever muscle aches all over sharp pains in my stomach severe nausea vommitting pounding headache amp extreme fatigue I was told to take with a meal and drink lots of water I felt like I was drinking gallons a dayuntil I couldnt drink or eat anything without throwing it up I stopped taking the second time after pills and it took full days amp lots of Tylenol for my symptoms to subside
3214,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42646,12,Im allergic to sulfa and penicillin so my doc prescribed Macrobid The first time I took this medicine I felt fine besides some nasty nausea I didnt take the last pills because of it but my UTI went away almost immediately This time I feel horrible I felt good after the first doses but now after I take it rd day I am weak I feel like its hard to breathe and my stomach burnshurts so bad I cant stand it It also makes me very tired and out of itwoozy The burning during urination has went away but I feel worse than what I did with the UTI I hate to stop it early but I fear I may end up in the hospital if I dont Its not a bad med just hit or miss side effects I say try it out though Its worth that much at least
3215,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42646,14,First I noticed my computer screen got too bright and then I had to let less light into my room After One Week being on Macrobid I really got worried as every thing I normally could see such as my wall clock was blurry and I could not even see the numbers I saw my eye doctor and it was determined after many tests that Macrobid was really degrading my vision and it happened quite rapidly It took about a good full two weeks before I felt my vision was returning close to normal Yes when your vision goes bad one gets really shakenIf you notice that things start to get too bright after two days of being on this drug See you Doctor and fast I had a vision test two months later and I am happy to report all was once again well
3216,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42646,8,Will NEVER take this again I took this for three days and ended up being hospitalized for days A kidney biopsy was done and determined to be a sever reaction to the drug After the diagnosis I was in dialysis for weeks A very traumatic experience

3220,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42589,1,My month old daughter was recently diagnosed with her nd urinary tract infection With her st one the dr prescribed Sufrax oral suspension We didnt have any issue with it and it cleared up the UTI quickly This time she was prescribed Nitrofurantoin oral suspension She is exclusively breastfed but will take a bottle of breast milk if offered The Nitrofurantoin is so sweet that she wont take it from a medicine syringe or hidden in a bottle of breast milk Either way she spits it everywhere even if shes hungry My question is why TH would they add so much sugar First kids dont need the extra sugar nd you can add flavored sugary syrup at the pharmacy for if a kid wont take it otherwise Way to go idiots
3221,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42589,9,I was prescribed for a very painful UTI After days I felt no relief The th day I began to feel better but very fatigued The th day I developed a rash on my scalp I thought it was shingles I woke up the th day with extreme itching and discomfort The rash had spread to my shoulders and eventually down my chest and to my waistline I went to my doctor who took me off Macrobid switched me to Cipro for another round of antibiotics and prescribed a shampoo and topical ointment for the rash I wish I had changed antiobiotics that th day This is miserable red itchy welts everywhere and low grade fever
3222,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42587,6,Took the pills for days and it made me so much sicker fever migraine aches in my bones and complete exhaustion felt like I was dying Called my doctor and now trying ciprin
3223,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42587,18,Honestly I was pretty scared taking this medicine after reading these reviews but I took it and did not have one problem what so ever also cleared my UTI right up Started off taking bacterium and had The WORST side effects headache dizziness my body tingled Super sick so they switched me to macrobid for days and had no problems ate with a healthy meal ever time I took it and drank lots of water throughout the day Everyone is different so I guess I found the one that works best for me
3225,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42582,19,The first few doses made me feel like I had been hit by a truck Things improved and now I am in the third day and fine Burning urgency leaking GONE so I will finish my days of medication I had Cipro for days previously and after I finished in three days I had symptoms again
3227,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42580,4,Increased my anxiety gave me upper back pains terrible nausea and chills I do not recommend this if you are sensitive to medication I took it just in case for a mild UTI and definitely should have stuck with homeopathic methods

3229,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42580,15,Ive take this before with no side effects This time the doctor recommended me to take it for days milligrams once a day for recurring UTI By the second dose I am in the bed feel like I have the flu a virus at the same time and vision going Not going to take anymore of this microbid Wish I had only filled days of meds instead of day Spent to much money on something I cant take Take with caution
3230,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42579,10,Started four days ago with a UTI Started taking Nitrofurantoin MonoMac mg twice daily Ive been taking it am and pm for two days Today I woke up feeling absolutely horrible Burning clammy skin chills without fever bad pain in left side of lower back Pretty much cant get out of bed Ive had UTIs before and can still function These meds are risky Went to Doc this morning and he confirmed that its most likely this med Just wanted to put my review out here to help if someome might feel the same
3231,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42578,13,by end of day one doses I felt very tired Day two I woke up weak fatigued achey but was advised to stay on Macrobid as the UTI symptoms had improved As day wore on doses I became increasingly tired no energy headache sensation of heart racing nausea Another call to provider and they suggested I switch to Cipro Before I could do that an episode of nausea sent me to the bathroom I passed out hit my head and ended up hospitalized I would be very afraid of this medication considering the other options
3232,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42577,12,This drug is fine for me It makes me feel foggy tired and just out of sorts for a few hours but i can still function The headaches are the worst part Im on day so Im sticking it out
3233,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42577,10,I started taking mg of macrobid twice a day on Wednesday evening It is now Tuesday I have two pills left One for this morning and one for tonight I cant wait to be off this medication My uti symptoms were gone between day one and two but I was told to take all the medication even if it gets better I take this medication at am and pm From about pmpm I am extremely nauseous its horrible Then I also wake up off and on from am because of nausea I always take the pill with a meal so I dont know why Im still experiencing the nausea Thats the only bad side effect I have experienced so far Cant wait to be done with this medication
3236,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42572,4,Ive had a recurrent UTI for the past month and no other antibiotics had been working Doctor prescribed this one mg twice a day every hours for five days After my first dose my urgency to urinate had subsided a lot Nevertheless by the second dose severe nausea constipation and fatigue began I have been a zombie at work and just the thought of food makes me want to puke even though Ive been forcing myself to have at least three full meals a day particularly when I take the medication Have two more days to go and I just wrote to my provider to see if I MUST finish it The UTI symptoms are gone at this point yet the side effects are decreasing my quality of life by the minute
3238,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42569,26,Im on day so I have taken pills and I feel absolutely horrible nausea I have aches all over like the flu and pains in my stomach sharp ones I can barely keep my head up I am stopping them and going back to the doctor tomorrow I have never felt so bad also very explosive diarrhea Im thinking of going to the hospital I feel as if I have been poisoned
3239,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,7,42563,5,So I get constant bladder infections and honestly they ruin my life I have to take time off work which I dont want to do I sit uncomfortable for a good of my life its horrible I would take anything to stop constant bladder infections I have to say I have been on this tablet twice now last two times was g four times a day and it literally got rid of my discomfort in about two hours I had mild headache but never put two and two together But now Im on g twice a day and I read these reviews and like clockwork I felt instantly awful now more days off work its the worst but is it physchological Or is it because the change in dose I feel awful my head is foggy and I feel anxious tired and sick
3240,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42559,17,I am currently on day of macrobid x daily for days Pharmacist was sure to emphasize to take macrobid with food to prevent nausea So far I have no nausea but have developed a terrible headache I must say that pain of the UTI was gone within two hours of taking my first dose which is worth it to me So Ill be sticking this one out and hope the headache doesnt worsen
3241,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42559,47,After reading a lot of bad reviews I was hesitant to use macrobid as a treatment for a pretty severe bladder infection However I didnt experience many of the side effects that I read about Although it did make me rather fatigued I made sure to drink lots of water and took my pills with a nice healthy meal I also took my mg pills twice a day at the exact same time as to get my body on a routine Almost days off of it and feeling back to Would have no problem using this antibiotic again
3242,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,42558,16,I took this med once before and had the same symptoms so I dont think the first time was a fluke After taking just one pill within a few hours I was nauseous to the point I could not lay down My head started to hurt and then within in six hours I had body aches all over I also developed a cough and it was hard to breathe It has been over hours I am just now starting to feel a little better This medicine is awful Dont take it
3244,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42640,8,This drug should be banned from use Im in agony with cramp in my stomach Last night I thought my head was going to explode and Ive not been able to go out today Feel so low in mood tearful and lethargic
3245,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42639,27,I am weeks pregnant and ended up with my first UTI I was prescribed Macrobid because I am very allergic to Sulfa antibiotics which landed me in a hospital a few years back Upon reading the reviews I was so incredibly terrified to take this medication but I had no choice Ill consider myself lucky but so far I have found that Macrobid is actually quite tolerable Ive been a bit more tired and achy than usual and had some mild nausea but nothing too severe I have found that taking with a full meal is critical and drinking TONS of fluid waterGatorade helps with side effects But for me this is really a reminder to take reviews with a grain of salt you really have no idea how your body will react until you try it yourself
3246,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42637,74,I am finding it VERY hard to believe these bad reviews of MacrobidIm thinking these are the apple cider vinegar DMannose and cranberry juice people NONE of which cure UTIs I have been battling reccurent andor relapsing UTIs for a few years despite being celibate Up until now Bactrim worked yes it gave me a headache and made my heart race but it worked Then I tried monurol worked a few times expensive beyond then stopped yesterday I tried Macrobid first timeno side effects Had I listened to these reviews I would have killed myself before taking it It seems to be working It doesnt kill your gut flora Its considered one of the SAFEST of the UTI drugs All I can say is do not be afraid to try it
3248,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42634,12,Had a UTI and went to urgent care The doctor there put me on this medication and while it does work within a couple of days the nausea is so bad Ive been feeling so sick to my stomach since taking this medication I cant seem to focus on anything and the headaches are really bad as well I know others may have completely different experiences I am only sharing mine
3249,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42626,0,weeks pregnant got told I had a UTI I was prescribed this medicine take it every hours for days It did not work at all Still dealing with all UTI symptoms
3250,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,6,42625,20,Had bad stomach aches after taking the medication Also dizziness and nausea After a while the side effects lessened
3252,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42620,17,This medicine works like a dream No side effect what so ever I was taking augmentin and I hated it I asked for macrobid instead days and I was feeling a whole lot better

3414,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42320,7,Works great for getting rid of a UTI or as a prophylaxis for UTIs But the accompanying nausea is hard to bear I would have to take an antinausea pill at the same time along with a little food or I would not make it Best time is to take before bed

3421,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,4,42222,4,I was told to take this four times a day for three days but after taking just two I started having side effects The first day I had to go to bed as I had a throbbing headache upper stomach pain and feeling sick I have been advised to carry on taking it and have two tablets left While on this medication I have felt so so tired I have fallen asleep on the sofa midday a few times Not to mention a constant headache throughout Neon pee too which took me by surprise Cannot wait for this to be out of my system However my UTI symptoms have almost gone

3428,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42189,1,This did NOT suit meI was given mg twice a day After the first dose suddenly Blood Pressure and pulse rate shot up in a spike I have been having high BP and Pulse already So took those medicines and the parameters came down to normalSecond doze was in the night It didnt cause that trouble but after sometime started getting hot flushes However I tolerated that After taking the pill next day after lunch after say minutes heart started beating God damn fast This time the discomfort was times than the previous one BP and Pulse were even higher Took the pills for BP Pulse and double dose of tranquilizers to slowly pacify the effect I was about to be taken to ERGot to discard them
3429,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42188,35,I have reoccurring utis every couple months and I have taken every antibiotic Cipro and keflex did not work for me and bactrim I had horrible side effects Macrobid is the only one to cure my utis every time Of course it depends on which bacteria is causing yours
3430,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42185,52,I have been prone to utis for years I have been put on every antibiotic under the sun For me this is the antibiotic I would choose every time because it works and has minimal side effects The only side effect I have experienced is a headache I will take a headache any day over horrible bladder infection pain Also this antibiotic helps to clear up the infection within the first day of use which is a plus for me so I am not in pain as long I have taken cipro which made me throw up and cry bactrum didnt clear up my infection and monurol which made me very sick as well It is important to remember to make a quotpill sandwichquot with this antibiotic You eat a full meal take the pill and then eat some snacks after the pill
3432,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42182,12,This is terrible drug I took it for days and after I finished all of it I broke out in a bad rash had fever hurt all over Ive been off of it for over a week and had to go to Dr twice This should be taken off the market I just hope permanent damage was not done to my organs
3433,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42180,22,Macrobid has to be the worse medication I have ever took in my life It should be banned I got an extreme allergic reaction that lasted at least month I was put on prednisone and Zyrtec to stop my body from swelling I had red marks and rashes throughout my body even while on prednisone and Zyrtec after using marcrobid Initially I placed on marcrobid for a uti I took all prescribed pills One week after finishing the macrobid I experienced extreme swelling throughout my body I feel as if my body still never recovered from the reaction years later I recommend cipro over macrobid it is dangerous And should be banned
3435,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42178,8,Prescriped twice a day for days and it started working after the second pilli can say it has helped the condition greatly but I have been fatigued sleepy with some backache Have two days to go and cant waitit does get the job done so the side effects are worth it
3436,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,6,42176,29,I have been taking macrobid for two days now and my UTI feels better but today I woke up with terrible back aches where my kidneys are located and pains on my front sides I have been so sleepy also today like cant even keep my eyes open with bad headaches

3439,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42163,14,Took first pill with no food No stomach upset Had mild chills st night min Feeling great on rd day No other side effects
3443,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42157,12,I gave this medication a for effectiveness because my UTI symptoms subsided completely after the second dose Im still taking this medication and have two and a half days left Since starting my doses I have experienced nausea extreme fatigue and muscle weakness shortness of breath sensitivity to heat and a loss of appetite I cant wait till its over After reading all the reviews it seems this medication makes everyone sick It did seem to clear up my UTI though which was worse than these symptoms but not by much
3444,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42309,17,I have been taking micro for days and I feel worse than the UTI my stomach hurts really bad heartburn is terrible and chest pain very bad gas pains all and all I feel like crap I stopped taking it and lets see if I feel better never again will I take this my neighbor took it and ended up in the hospital almost died

3447,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,3,42308,24,I had this tablet prescribed to me to take for three days twice a day to prevent bladder infection The tablet made me go yellowvomit lose my appetite and generally made me feel really bad I still have a bladder infection so I wouldnt recommend it
3448,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,3,42301,21,I took this medicine for a bladder infection and took it for the full five days prescribed The first day I felt immediate relief and reduced discomfort of about However with each day that followed my relief did not increase and within hours of completing perscription my symptoms were back by So either the dose wasnt strong enough mg or the prescription wasnt long enough No way of knowing if either or both of these conditions were changed I would have experienced more success with this particular antibiotic
3449,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42300,15,Im usually skeptical about these posts and the crazy side effects so I didnt take them seriously when I was prescribed this medication I only took doses and although my symptoms are gone I had the worst splitting headache Ive ever had intense nausea and foggy brainnot feeling myself I skipped my th dose and felt completely better within a few hours I felt worse on this medication than I ever did with a UTI
3450,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42300,22,After never having even a urine infection in my whole years after having a baby I got utis in months Keflex for the first That worked well Macrobid for the others It does make me a little drowsy and have mild sort of quothallucinationsquot but it does work for me quite well After the nd dose all of my symptoms are gone For me the benefit outweighs the side effects
3452,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42294,40,This works fine for me Im allergic to most of the antibiotics out there but not this one thankfully I get utis frequently because I always have to be cultured sometimes that waiting period helps the thing really get going Normally its a day course I do not get headaches or any of the side effects others have had Everybodys body is different the only way youll know how you will react is to take it yourself
3453,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42294,10,My mother is years old and took this for a bacterial infection that kept causing UTIs We have both taken many different antibiotic pills and medications over the years for various illnesses but never have I seen a reaction as bad as this one My mom was complaining of a headache and then she was so weak she could barely stand She had chills a fever and was curled up in a ball in bed for the next hours Now she has to go to the hospital and get an IV with a different antibiotic to treat the infection This drug is incredibly powerful and watching its effects was extremely scary
3455,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42292,10,Will never put another pill in my mouth Painful muscle aches fatigue nausea fever chills night sweats tired the list goes on I have been off it for days and the muscle aches and fatigue are still here Never never again
3456,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42291,12,Just came back from ER I have started doing self cath in severe pain frequent urination I have taken this med before many times for UTIs with excellent results doesnt usually cause yeast infections or c diff I cant believe all the bad reviews I never had any side effects at all just hope Im on right med waiting for culture results only took pill so far

3459,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42285,41,Ive been suffering from UTIs o amp off for the last year During this time I was prescribed a Sulfate antibiotic which I discovered I was allergic to within hours I developed hives amp blisters all over my face amp body So Cipro was prescribed every time for the UTIs that subsequently followed It seemed it took about days before the symptoms to go away but I never felt fully cured because even though the urgency and burning went away I was having a hard time holding my urine if I had a close to full or full bladder Then I would have about weeks of feeling ok only to have the UTI start all over again I was at my wits end I was prescribe Macro I felt relief in hours with absolutely no side effects I hope this is finally the end
3460,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42283,41,I have been suffering on and off with UTIs for about years now my mother and grandmother are prone to them and I see to have inherited that unfortunately and I mean SUFFERING My symptoms get to the point of missing work and making trips to the ER This past infection was the first time that I was put on Macrobid and I have nothing more to say than that it is a miracle drug Within hours of taking the first dose the urgency of needing to urinate had diminished tenfold On day two now fourth dose and all of the pain is gone I am on many more medications and the fact that my doctor could find an antibiotic that wouldnt interact with anything I was currently taking including birth control was incredible Will use in the future
3461,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42282,21,Had either a urinary infection or intestinal New to macrobid in one day after taking the medicine I ran a fever was nauseous and hurt all over Ran a fever off and on till I got off the med and started cipro Began noticing fatigue brain fog and constant headaches weeks later Ive been diagnosed with hypoxmia and am starting night time oxygen therapy Already have RA Sjogrens and Sarcoidosis didnt need this drug complicating my life Macrobid should be taken off the market
3462,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42279,21,was prescribed this medication for a UTI Never had this pill before OMGI was nauseous with chest pains and only took it for days Also gastro issues and feeling like you are in a fogI always got CIPRO for this type of E coli infection Dont know why my doctor gave me this horrible medicine Called today for different medication because I am not sure if the infection is cleared up Pain is gone but that is all Wouldnt recommend this
3463,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42277,3,Prescribed by doctor since I am allergic to sulfa meds Developed horrible mouth soreness that is so bad I cant drink or eat much like I was eating hot peppers Urine on treatment day hadnt changed
3466,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42275,8,I took this for a bladder infection It took hours for me to notice any improvement I am on day I had minutes of mild nausea one day but that was the only side effect Not as bad as others like doxycycline Surprised to find this didnt make my yeast infection come back or cause any other unpleasant side effects
3467,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42275,13,Was prescribed this for an ecoli UTI but had never received this in the past BAD choice of color of pill It forewarns issues Had what I thought was the flu this weekend Twelve hrs then the fever broke Did know know that flu symtoms could be a side effect Have had head aches top of head since beginning Now have vaginitis of some ilk Now dont know what route the Dr will suggest Worried in pain and not sleeping waiting for the drs office to open I will always put macrobid in my medical records as an allergy Took in generic form to keep costs down Still expensive and now must start over with another drug delaying both the cure of the UTI and causing the vaginal discharge
3468,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42274,68,Was so traumatized to take this med based on other reviews Im and quot and get sick and nauseous from even one tynenol regular strength I got pedialyte to prepare Took the pill and waited And NOTHING happened except my uti going away Do yourself a favor and dont read the Internet Trust your dr
3470,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42088,16,Prescribed this medication for urinary tract infection since I had cdiff last year and cannot take the stronger antibiotics right now Could tell difference in bladder pressure and pain within two days however dealing with the side effect of headache being sleepy and muscle aches makes me ready to get this all taken
3471,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42086,23,This medication made me feel awful I woke up everyday with a bad headache experienced nausea dizziness and extreme tiredness throughout the week everyday I dont think I can finish the full week as I need to resume my life I wouldnt take this again However the infection seems to be gone so it worked for that
3472,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42086,37,Made me sick Ran a fever and was very dizzy and disoriented for days
3473,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5,42085,4,Im and have had a number of bladder infections before however this time it was worse I was prescribed nitrofurantoin and only found it worked at helping ease my kidney pain but I still had a burning sensation when I urinated and also had pain in my lower abdomen which didnt clear when taking the tablets even for a few days after I had finished my prescribed dosage I found I was still in pain I would recommend for very minor and less serious infections
3474,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,3,42075,29,Havent had a UTI in probably more than years Have recently been diagnosed with in the last months Had Macrobid both times The first time I ended up with fever and chills but thought I was unlucky and had picked up a virus Symptoms went away by the end of the treatment When UTI came back I was given the same medication Within hours of taking the first does my fever and chills became so bad that I almost went to urgent care Advil reduced the fever temporarily but I wont take it again
3475,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42071,33,My third day on it no side effects and not having to the bathroom every hour I will definitely take it again
3476,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,5,42071,20,Headache nauseous on day one left arm tingling day Nightmare and neck pain day and more days to go
3477,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42070,13,I took my first pill of macrobid last night and it caused nausea and it made me exhausted I noticed when I was nauseous I felt better if I ate something Its like I constantly needed something in my stomach but I felt miserable I also had chills so Im guessing I had a fever Im about to eat a heavy breakfast and take my next pill hopefully this second dose goes okay Otherwise my doctor is getting a phone call first thing Monday morning
3478,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8,42064,53,Third day on it and I feel like I have the flu but without respiratory symptoms Tired muscle aches headache dizziness nauseated Still better than having to pee painfully every ten minutes
3479,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42063,27,It made me very sleepy and dizzy I also got chest pains and it made my heart race My urine was also a very bright almost neon yellow color I stopped taking it after it days and then I was fine And I always took it after I ate The one time I took it on an empty stomach I vomited and was nauseous for a few hours
3480,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42048,63,After reading the reviews of Macrobid I was terrified to take it As a person with severe acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome I was scared that I would have all these terrible experiences that people were describing However all of my doses were taken with a COMPLETE meal and I did not suffer from any side effects except for a slight headache
3481,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42044,38,Tried this medication several times and was not effective UTI had only worsened Side effect of diarrhea also
3482,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,42043,5,I was given Nitrofurantoin as two previous antibiotics hadnt helped to shift my kidney infection I take a day for days and Im halfway through my suggested dose I have improved being on this medication but I cant feel the benefits as the nausea vomiting and tiredness are too severe too notice the change I feel constantly sick and occasional vomiting and extremely tired I think its the side effects of the tablets I have barely been out of bed for a week I hope to pick up soon
3483,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10,42037,68,I was prescribed this based on my symptoms and prior to the lab results coming back My first dose was at pm and the second at am By lunch the blood in my urine was gone and the pains were subsiding I took as scheduled with no side effects and when my cultures came back it was confirmed a bladder infection This medicine is fantastic
3486,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42022,50,Ive been on this medication more times than I can remember and it always works wonderfully The only side effect is some sleepiness but make sure to drink enough water and have a little caffeine
3487,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42022,58,It is the only antibiotic that works for my urinary tract infections and I havent ever had any of the side effects I generally feel better already after the nd dose
3488,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42015,49,Dont take on an empty stomach Always works great for me
3491,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,41988,11,It doesnt work for me one bit
3492,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,41980,74,At first it wasnt working but the closer I got to finishing the pills it was clearing up I made sure I ate before I took the pill to avoid getting sick It made me extremely sleepy though
3493,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,7,41948,35,Taking mg xs daily for urinary tract infection On day of with limited side effects I have a severe allergy to many medications but thankfully no severe reaction to this one I noticed the nausea is alleviated if you drink a full oz glass of water with each dose and continue drinking water throughout the day I work long hours so not sure if the drowsiness is caused by the medication or not Some vaginal itching and discomfort but so far no vaginal infection Doctor recommended I eat yogurt daily while on this medication and I am following doctors orders I have felt some dizziness but it isnt constant
3495,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42268,3,Dr gave for UTI and mg twice a day for days first day took oneand night had terrible pain in the stomach next day took and that nightmy throat swelledthat was it and I read the side effects I had twothat was enough for me since I had spent three nights in ICU at hospitala couple of years earlier for swollen tongue from allergic reaction to Lisinprol forblood pressureI did not want to take that kind of chance I am sure there is other medicine out there but he felt I didnt give it a chanceIt looks like you can have different reactions at different timesmeaning it doesnt bother you one time you take it but it can the next time side effects deadly
3497,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42264,5,This was effective in treating my UTI Mine started on a Wednesday I went to see my GP on friday I was diagnosed with a mild UTI and I started taking nitrofurantoin mg from Friday evening The only reason I deducted stars is because it took days to ease the pain and some side effects like nausea during afternoon and mild discomfort while sleeping after taking this pillI took plenty of water and used to take the dose on time for days
3498,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42263,5,Do not take this medicationI feel as if I have poisoned myself I was prescribed to take one pill twice a day for days After the nd dose I began vomiting and had an awful pounding headache I called the doctor to ask if I could be given something else and he said no and to continue taking the medication After the rd and th dose I am not taking it anymore I feel nauseated constantly my body aches and I feel like I am sick and the worst part is my chest hurts really bad I have a constant painpressure in the center of my chest and if I laugh or cough it feels like my entire chest cavity hurts I have read that is one of the more serious side effects and its freaking me out How can an antibiotic make your chest hurt like that
3499,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42257,24,I was prescribed this medicine for a bladder infection and would never recommend anyone to take it Obviously it depends on your body type but I usually have a high tolerance Im needing to head to the doctors now because Ive been experiencing painful headaches everyday sharp stomach aches muscle pain chills hot to brutally coldfever type symptoms tingling light headed nauseous eye aches my urine went from neon green to dark brown and as gross as it is I havent been able to take a proper poo but every time I pass gas on the toilet watery diarrhea like stuff comes out and Ive seen some blood when I whipped This medicine definitely didnt go well with me and is a painful experience
3501,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42250,9,This medication was prescribed for a UTI I was given capsules to be taken a day for days The WHAM hit me shortly after the first pill Within hours I became totally lost I shook with chills my head pounded with a horrible headache my eyes just wanted to stay closed and I spent a very unrestful night When I had to go to the bathroom or to get water I dizzily stumbled into furniture I had absolutely NO appetite but made myself eat enough to take three more pills before I QUIT The list of possible side affects on the package read like a checklist of my issues I realize each person can experience different sideaffects but I think any responsible doctor should discuss these before prescribing DO NOT EVEN TRY
3502,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42250,6,Im one of those female twenty somethings that always have UTI issues and most antibiotics make me nauseous but this one is nausea plus maybe like a little headache Like the kind you get if you dont drink enough water but like whatever It normally kicks in after days or so
3503,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42247,15,The only side effect I had from this medication was diarrhea and frankly I will take that over having to urinate every mins It took days to get relief and I may ask for another round just to make sure its gone since I am going on vacation soon I realize I had a really bad infection and maybe thats why it didnt work right away I did not get a yeast infection yet which shocks me because I am diabetic and get everything like that
3504,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42246,17,Almost died Severe lung scarring and severe hypoxia saturation months of continual oxygen fortunately I recovered
3507,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42241,3,I take this medication with food per the instructions I was given yet I do experience a very very severe headache with this medication that does not get better with pain medication such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen I even tried my Sumatriptan that I normally use for migraines hoping it would help but it very sadly did nothing for my headache The severe headache is the only symptom that is really a big issue for me and otherwise I find this medication very effective I just wish there was something I could do about the head pain as it is very difficult to get through the day with a throbbing migrainelike headache that cannot be treated with any type of pain medication
3508,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42240,5,Im I day of this medication Its pretty good at clearing up the UTI but it does have some side affects Ive had pain on my left lower stomach towards pelvis for many days off and on It feels almost like cramps I also have had a tingling tounge and possible thrush though hopefully notsymptom havent progressed I cant take a lot of abx so Im thankful that this has worked but looking forward to being DONE
3509,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42238,6,Stomach pain nausea feel like could get sick after complete doses shortness of breath chest pain
3512,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,2,42231,5,I took this medication for days I feel like it cured the UTI but ached the entire time while taking it Approximately days ago had severe pain in my left hip Hip feels better now but have fingers on right hand that are swollen and feel like an extremely bad sprain Now having the same pain in my left hand My neck is stiff and hurting as well as my back Have to take Ibuprofen around the clock I am just hoping that the pain will start subsiding now that I have been off the antibiotic for hrs
3514,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42230,3,I took one dose and I felt nausea the next night I took a second dose and woke out my sleep and my tongue had swollen up I had to be rushed to the hospital but the UTI went away serious terrible scary situation never again
3515,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42229,6,I dont do the best on any medicine Ive fought UTIs for years Im pregnant and was terrified to take another medicine But UTIs can be serious and the pain I was in was horrific Im on mg x daily for weeks no issues Day Urine is neon but UTI had it discolored anyway No issues so far Minimal headache could be from the other infection I have too and no discomfort Im pleasantly surprised This is working well for me and my medical needs
3516,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42228,3,Horrible I tried this once and it worked Second time allergic reaction rd time my Dr prescribed it anyway and I almost died Woke up after nd dose unable to breathe Fever of Bone and muscle pain Crushing chest pain Blue hands Swollen tongue and face Rash all over body This is the worst drug out here Do not use Macrobid Its a nightmare
3518,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,4,42226,1,A horrible drug Macrobid should be banned I feel weak and I have had two anxiety attacks because of it Im super tired and depressed I am sensitive to antibiotics anyways I called CVS and they told me to continue it Ummm hell no Whether you take it with or without food it is horrible for your body I felt pins and needles in my back from this on the third night Buhbye
3520,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42152,11,Im on day two of taking this I have had very mild side affects Slight headache and sort of feel tired and out of it for a little bit but it seems to go away I have not had the bad side affects that others have mentioned and always take it with some food and have been drinking lots of water to flush my system out Everyone is effected differently by meds If you have not had this antibiotic before then I would not let others reviews scare you If you have problems after taking it then call and talk to your doctor about it Even though the pharmacist said I could drink alcohol moderately I plan to stay away as that could aggravate the side affects and it also dehydrates you which will do nothing but aggravate a UTI
3521,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,7,42151,8,I have taken nitrofurantoin before from different manufacturer and Ive never had symptoms as I have now while taking Macrobid I constantly feel nauseous the temperature keeps rising I also have symptoms like cold nose is congested voice is cracking chest is heavy and sometimes painful At times its hard to breath However I felt better after just capsule so at least the pain of UTI has gone One problem down and I hope all of the above will disappear as soon as I finish the course
3522,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42151,8,Was prescribed this for uti and started feeling nauseous after the second tablet by the second day I was vomiting and struggling to keep even fluids down Was getting cold sweats and just feeling generally unwell Went back the drs and they changed antibiotic Also dr retested urine and infection was positive Didnt do a thing for me just made me feel awful
3525,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42148,40,Rx paperwork does not say Take with Food even tho it is very important to do so My UTI symptoms were gone after taking the first pill I only have to take it for days but I am experiencing some side effects I feel achy and very sleepy Just have no energy in general I had diarrhea after the first dose but not terrible I just dont want to get out of bed I still rated this med a because it did take away my UTI symptoms almost immediately Just remember to eat a full meal before each dose and it makes all the difference in the side effects Two pills to go I can do this
3526,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,42148,14,Started having symptoms of UTI called my Dr and they sent in an rx I started taking it Friday morning That evening I didnt quite feel right Took my second dose before bed on Friday Saturday was the worst day of my life I took my third dose that morning even though I was feeling pretty rough I didnt think it was the nitrofurantoin monohyd macro mg Every joint hurt From my ankles to my neck I had shortness of breath splitting headache and a fever Chills that became sweats I slept in a puddle of sweat The sheets are soaked My fever went from and spiked at I woke up on Sunday feeling much better When I looked up the side effects on this drug I stopped taking it
3527,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,42147,23,my daughter was put on Macrodantin to prevent kidney infections and after months was struggling to breath while playing football tests showed that her pulmonary function had reduced by and she had developed an irregular heart beat I would think carefully before taking this drug as you may be damaging your lungs to save your kidneys
3528,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9,42143,10,This medicine started to work from day one which was a huge relief I took it immediately after main meals with a full glass of water and drank lots of water during the day and had no stomach issues with it whatsoever It had some unpleasant side effects headaches most days wooziness tiredness in the evenings and some weird ones neon yellow pee but it also was effective against a really nasty UTI Id take it again if the condition returned
3531,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9,42130,32,First day worked fine although will say my pee was neonwasnt expecting that Second day however tired all of the time with a killer headache that doesnt seem to go away and very cold and achey Good that I can finally sleep after three nights of not being able to great bank holiday that was and pain went after the first two tablets were taken This is the second time ive been on these would definitely take again
3532,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42130,54,Taking Macroboid has saved my life I have been prone to UTIs since I was sexually active and have had bladder infections by whole life I have tried everything from Cipro makes my feet swollen to Bactrum doesnt cure amongst many others I was very surprised by the other reviews so felt the need to write one because it has been the best medication to help prevent me from getting another UTI as long as I take food with it I am fine
3533,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42129,13,Developed interstitial lung disease and hypoxia
3534,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42125,21,I started this medicine for my UTI I always ate a meal with this pill I really did not experience any sickness I was on it for days I have trouble anxiety but it was not too bad but it seemed like this medicine made me more anxious at times then on my last few days I felt a little weird at times then on my last day taking the medicine I woke up with my throat scratchy then by evening I had a fever and bad chills I didnt take the last pill because I felt so bad my head kinda hurts too I dont know if its this medicine for sure or if Im catching a virus
3535,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,10,42123,11,I decided to do some research to make sure that I was prescribed the correct thing I had never heard of an antibiotic starting with Nitro After reading the scary reviews I contacted my doctors office and they assured me they have multiple patients that have been prescribed it and with good results I was prescribed pills a day for days and I wouldnt even know I was on it other than a change in the color of my urine I feel completely normal and have no side effects and it is getting the job done I felt better after one day
3536,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,8,42122,40,Prescribed macrobid for a UTI I took my first pill last night with rice and bread felt fine Woke up this morning to get ready for work and had to sit down in the shower I got so nauseous Couldnt even finish washing out my shampoo and had to lean over the toilet because I thought I would throw up Held it in and almost passed out walking back to my bed Slept another three hours then got up to try to make toast and got too nauseous and dizzy to even wait on the toaster The UTI already feels much better after one pill but I have never felt so miserable am missing work and have called my doctor to try to get off this medication
3538,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3,42115,14,I have a longstanding history with urinary tract infections I was getting them x a month and one instance it was so bad I even went to the ER At that point my doctor prescribed nitrofurantin mg as a preventative method which works However this time around when she prescribed it to treat a UTI mg x a day for days it was one of the worst medication experiences ever The side effects were TERRIBLE I have never experienced such bad nausea in my life I had splitting migraines could barely open my eyes amp felt like I was going to vomit Lasted the entire day in waves I also took on a full stomach with water and it still didnt help Also only slightly dimished UTI symptoms the first day providing moderate relief
3539,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,2,42111,34,This is the second time I have been prescribed this drug and it has done nothing but prolong my pain There has to be something better than this for UTIs it was not a shock for me to see all of the low reviews on it
3541,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,1,42105,19,Every single time my doc prescribes this I beg for something different The side effects for me start right after the first dose and continue to get worse Extremely nauseated splitting headache muscles aching especially in my neck dizziness loss of appetite and just an all over feeling of being sick My daughter just came over to help take care of me and just named several other medicines that are very effective for bladder infections without the side effects
3543,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42096,37,On first day severe nausea headache and vomiting Couldnt get out of bed and had to stop taking
3544,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1,42093,20,I had flu like symptoms when I first started taking it Now every morning Im throwing up The urinary tract infection is getting better but this medicine is awful
3545,Arnuity Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,9,42700,10,My Dr gave me this medicine as a trial when I was diagnosed with adult onset asthma I tried Qvar first and that gave me chest pain and tightness This medicine had no side effects at all and worked great The only downfall is my insurance doesnt cover this so I have to switch to something else
3547,Altabax,Impetig,10,41185,8,Used free sample Will get some next time I get impetigo in the same recurring spot I have had it my whole life Altabax worked better than any other antibiotic cream Ive tried

3549,Altabax,Acne,9,40685,4,Hi I get pimples on my face nose area especially I use Altabax when I first detect any sign of pain under the skin If I catch it early enough it dries up overnight If I catch it after the pimple has a chance to harden a bit under the skin it takes longer If I waited too long Ill go for the Doxycycline too
3552,Altabax,Acne,8,40366,2,I was prescribed this after not having luck with Duac to treat and prevent adult acne It took about a week of twice daily application before I noticed a change I have been using it for over a month and it has completely cleared one problem area It appears that other areas around my neck are now being affected but I think with continued use it will also cure those problems and prevent further breakouts
3554,Altabax,Impetig,8,40323,7,Only day one but I think its starting to work But I had to write in this medicine STINGS like crazy on any type of open sore Takes an hour or so to calm down It works great

3618,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42011,31,Expensive but worth it My uric acid was in the range and I was having several severe gout attacks every year I tried allopurinol but didnt work so started on Uloric mg about months ago Had a few minor attacks during the first months but since then I can eat or drink anything and doesnt cause any flashes Doctors office just called and the uric acid level was
3622,Febuxostat,Gout,10,41570,58,I have had Gout since I was I am now I tried everything and nothing seemed to work My body would not accept Allapurinol no matter how long I stayed on it it caused bad flare ups Uloric has been a Godsend I almost forgot what it was like not to be in bad pain everyday My uric acid level is now down below and I take mg of Uloric daily I reccomend Uloric to anyone that has gout A truly great medicine that is priceless to me
3623,Febuxostat,Gout,10,41499,49,I have had the gout since I was am now I took allipuronol mg for many years it worked My doctor has changed me to Uloric for about months and have had no side effects my blood tests are well in range I am very pleased with this
3624,Febuxostat,Gout,10,41409,37,Ive been on Uloric for about years now Have NOT had flareup since and its also lowered my uric acid level in my blood Ive been on the A amp C meds for gout and they did nothing to help Uloric is a miracle in my opinion Very happy with it They also have a discount coupon for it which will lower what you pay for it
3625,Febuxostat,Gout,7,41120,42,I started mg Uloric about weeks ago just to lower my Uric Acid level which was over I had no symptoms within two weeks my uric acid level was around which is great however I had a flare up and it has not gone away for the past two weeks I am on Indomethacin and Prednisone it helps but I was just told not to take them together but the Indomethacin is hard on the stomach It is expensive but the makers of Uloric do have a coupon that helps with the cost
3626,Febuxostat,Gout,8,40865,55,I have taken Uloric for about years now and has done very well at controlling my gout I originally started with the mg pills but still had minor attacks about once a month My doctor increased my dosage to the mg and I no longer have attacks The price is way to high
3628,Febuxostat,Gout,9,40367,67,I have been using Uloric mg x a day for just about months It has been working very well but I was off it for two days and pain started up quickly again in my toe and hand joints Went back on it and is working again Colchicine works but the diarrhea is terrible Also my uric acid level was just above at start but now is very low and normal
3630,Febuxostat,Gout,8,40110,68,I started using Uloric mg on My uric acid was Blood work done it was down to BUT I developed a rash on one side of my face cutting back to mg every other day and using an ointment to see if the rash improves Couldnt tolerate any of the other medicines available for gout
3632,Onzetra Xsail,Migraine,10,42915,1,I was having my followup appointment with my neurologist and she gave me a sample of this because the oral tablets were not working and the nasal solution was taking a while to work for me This was my miracle drug for me one evening I felt my migraine coming on and I tried my sample pack I was very nervous about blowing something up my nostril but this wasnt bad at all and within minutes I could feel my headache start to calm down I did not have to go into my dark room I am really impressed and you dont taste the medication going down your throat as much as you do with the solution Thank you
3633,Onzetra Xsail,Migraine,1,42763,4,Went to see my neurologist for usual migraine check up med refills treatment While there he suggested Botox another story DO NOT DO IT I am in horrible non stop pain since I was in the middle of an episode I got a Toradol injection and this NEW Onzetra Nasal Not a fan of anything going up my nose should have went with my gut instinct You put one opening in a nostril the other in your mouth and blow Like blowing up balloon blowing powder through out your nose soft palette and throat It felt like sucking salt water up your nose the pain was immediate eye watering dizzying nose pinching nauseous pain I coughed gagged cried wanted to scream days later am worse than ever pain shaking incapacitated Not worth it
3634,Febuxostat,Gout,10,43061,0,My uric acid was after use Uloric went down to Ive had no attacks after started taking Uloric I stopped taking it and the uric acid went up but the pain was still coming back not exactly gout attack but I know the kind of pain on my joins so I started to take it again Now after taking mg regularly Ive got no pains or attacks No side effects good medicine but the price is just too high
3635,Febuxostat,Gout,1,42965,3,I started on uloric due to having an allergic reaction to allopurinol Well the nd day on it I broke out in a small rash not very noticeable and the rd day I have a burning painful rash all over my body My face started swelling and the slightest touch feels like someone is ripping my skin I was told to stop immediately and now its the wait game for the reaction to go away now
3636,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42941,0,Been taking Febuxostat for months or so Prior to doing so I had major agony gout attacks every two weeks First year the tablets activated all the stored crystals and I was in agony but not as frequentanyway I stuck with it and have had minor not too painful attacks in the last monthsafter yrs I should have cleared all the joints and wont have any further attacks Im running and in the gym for the first time in nearly years so feel better all round Stick with it is my advice The only downside has been a reduction in libido but Ill take that over the agony of gout
3637,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42892,5,My doctor told me for a few years that I would have to take a pill everyday for the rest of my life to avoid it I refused and fought it off with the regular pills when it flared up After struggling with gout for several years it had reached a chronic condition leaving me on crutches every other week It had become so bad I thought bones were breaking Turns out it was just even more intense gout attacks Finally I raised the white flag of surrender and agreed to take a pill everyday for the rest of my life After some research I decided on Uloric I have been taking one pill a day every day for the past years and I have not had a single gout flair up
3638,Febuxostat,Gout,4,42883,5,I have been on Uloric for the past months I have taken a pill every day mg with colchicine Unfortunately my attacks have become more frequent and more severe My doctor keeps saying I will get better but I am running out of patience and plan to go to a different doctor and possibly a different drug I need an honest second opinion it does not help that my Rheumatologist is closing his practice due to an impending lawsuit
3639,Febuxostat,Gout,5,42881,4,I have been on mg Uloric with colchicine for the last months I used to get attacks about once every months while only taking colchicine now with Uloric I get an attacks almost every month It took about months for my purine levels to fall to a normal range but still attacks I am saddened by the results My doctor says to continue and he expects it could be another year before I dont get attacks I dont believe him and am seeking a second opinion My attacks typically are in my feet and last to days I presently have a rare attack in my knee and I can hardly walk without severe pain I have an insurance plan that basically covers this
3640,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42870,6,Went on Uloric about years ago cleared gout up quickly but after months quit due to cost Have found that Gout attacks are too much to handle so have gone back on Uloric But have found that in Mexico you can buy the same drug for per month Thanks US healthcare
3642,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42848,3,I had gout for years and allergic to Allopurinol Overall my gout has been poorly managed Last year I had back to back debilitating attacks Radically changed diet with zero effect over many months Researched BP meds and was taken off Ramipril Immediate reduction in flare ups but UA still to After going onto mg Febuxostat UA was within days Took Colchicine during months As predicted had flare ups when starting as UA came out of joints With the worst ever gout attack Now all is fantastic and taken up exercise again My arthritic knees even seem better Dont know if this is coincidence Fortunately in UK this medicine is free on national health
3644,Febuxostat,Gout,8,42693,7,initial use caused flare up Regular use has been very effective at preventing flare ups Side effect for me is that although it doesnt seem to be be the cause of rashes it seems to exacperate an reoccurring eczema like skin condition on my hands Stopped use of Uloric to see if skin condition on hands would improve and the eczema was less severebut then I had a gout attackNo cost to me in Canada with a benefits plan
3645,Febuxostat,Gout,3,42558,11,Over priced medicationsProbably government sponsored at tax payers expense and then billed for profitShould be bucks for days
3646,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42523,21,Was diagnosed with Chronic Gout in early after over a decade of periodic attacks Suffered for straight months when subscribed Uloric As one should be quotgout freequot for some weeks before taking having Chronic gout wasnt possible so started off along with Cochicine Over years later Have never had another gout attack and best of all I can eatdrink whatever I want again Even Shrimp and Beer that were the worst causes for attacks My doctor commented he has never seen such dramatic drop in Uric acid levels in my blood tests although not many patients he has uses it due to the cost not all insurance companies may cover No side affects that seem apparent Life changing for the better
3649,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42399,17,Ive had gout and now tophus gout for years My UA is normally With Uloric Probenecid and Colcrys the combination of all three meds brings the UA down to great for getting rid of the tophiHaving a lot of insurance problems as they will not approve Uloric They keep saying that they have not received the doctors faxes though we have proof that they have received them etc so much for coverage of the elderly
3651,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42323,15,Still have short flareups of gout but less painful and pain only lasts a few hours
3653,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42232,27,Suffered for years Uloric a life changing drug No flares for the last years One mg tab allows me to eat and drink anything I want Blessed with Cadillac health coverage day supply only Would gladly pay anything for this type of relief Tophi build ups completely dissolved
3654,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42197,19,Started taking uloric after allopurinol gave me neuropothy in my feet and kept me up at night First drug to get uric acid below so happy doctor Im and have only had major gout attacks and never want to experience that again The expense has driven my drug costs into the quotdonut holequot and cant use the discount card due to the many restrictions Way to expensive but dont want gout again
3655,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42173,0,Smoother than alloprinol Long term side effects still not known but works very very well
3656,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42075,6,Had my first ever Gout flare in Since then had about attacks till but uric acid was always more than some times more than In I got flares in a year Thats when I started Febuxostat Worked like a charm Im taking mg daily Uric acid is maintained at mgdl since then I was drinking water like crazy before to maintain uric acid didnt help Now Im careless about water intake still uric acid levels are fine My doctor is very data driven so we took baseline SGPTSGOT liver enzymes test before starting the medication Measured uric acid and liver enzymes again after month and then after months No side effects on liver enzymes but uric acid level went down drastically So I love it
3657,Febuxostat,Gout,10,42069,30,Suffered for a few years with painful gout attacks Tried a few different things but nothing really worked for me A doctor had a trial bottle of Uloric mg and it changed my life It did take a couple of months before it brought my uric acid levels down and the attacks stopped In fact it was probably worse for the first month But I stuck with it and turned the corner I can now enjoy all the foods I used to eat without the consequence
3658,Febuxostat,Gout,9,42061,27,Worked well had attacks times a year bad ones Havent had an attack in years but really messed with my mind My dreams became so vivid and colorful fall asleep too quickly now Hard to wake up Starting to worry about memory loss so am going to switch out for awhile doctor agreed

3716,Fioricet,Headache,9,42418,34,I have received great relief from this medication It says discontinued because the acetaminophen dose has been lowered to MG per tablet It IS still available Great medicine for headaches Take with food though
3717,Fioricet,Headache,10,42390,14,Good
3719,Fioricet,Headache,10,42378,37,This is an old medication that I hope will never be removed My grandfather used to take it when it wasnt a prescription My father took it and I take it It kills the headache with just one dose within minutes Sometimes I may get sleepy when it takes effect but I also believe this happens due to the possibility that I hadnt slept well and is why that particular headache came on When I first started taking fioricet I did feel some light nausea and dizziness but I do not get those side effects any more I also am sure I eat a couple of saltines when I take it I have been on many other medications for my headaches and have not had the possitive results that I get from the fiorocet
3720,Fioricet,Headache,10,42365,34,I get migraines out of days This is the only medicine I have found that works so well I get sick my head pounds horribly like someone if hitting me hard with a bat
3721,Fioricet,Headache,9,42318,21,Have been prescribed this for plus years for migraines I only have them a few times a year and as long as I take fioricet as soon as I start getting the visuals before the migraine pain kicks in then the migraine is not bad at all The headache is very light if at all as well as the nausea
3722,Fioricet,Headache,10,42317,50,Ive taken this medicine for nearly years for debilitating migraines I am not addicted to Fioricet I do not get rebound headaches When the pain is gone its gone I have bad arthritis in the neck causing a combination of migraine and cluster migraines Ive taken every possible anticonvulsant combo and tried all kinds of migraine relief drugs and OTCs Nothing takes the pain away like Fioricet I take zonsiimide as a prophylactic now along along with Fioricet as needed The frequency of headaches have decreased with age but nonetheless still occur Fioricet will now not be covered by insurance company This is appalling Really Because of what Addicts Why are we penalizing those who need it by making them pay full price
3723,Fioricet,Headache,7,42226,29,My doctor prescribed Fioricet as a firstline treatment for my headaches Im still not sure whether theyre migraines tension headaches or something else but they always happen during my period Fioricet definitely works albeit with some side effects I react poorly to sedative drugs like butalbital in that I get awful rebound anxietydepression after only a couple doses All the more reason to use this medication sparingly Theres a definite euphoric effect that lends itself to abuse The combo of caffeine a sedative is a strange one but it works when all OTC stuff has failed I much prefer it over something like Topamax
3725,Fioricet,Headache,5,42185,21,Was prescribed this for tension headaches It does something but it makes me dizzy and light headed It seems to start working nearly immediately reduces the pain by like but after not too long the headache will start slowly creeping back over the course of the next few hours I actually have a headache Ive been attempting to treat with it right now and so far Ive taken pills over the course of hours and its still here
3726,Fioricet,Headache,1,42182,15,I had a spinal tap recently and unfortunately was in the small percentage of people that have spinal headaches from this procedure Ive had migraines forever but a spinal headache is by far the most debilitating experience I was prescribed fioricet and was taking every hours it did nothing I was back hospitalized the next day So this may work great for migraines but anyone prescribed this for spinal headaches it does not work
3727,Fioricet,Headache,10,42146,27,This Rx works wonderfully I love that it doesnt make me jittery or nauseous It works of the time for me Luckily I was able to have my tablets coated having a migraine and the bitter taste of the pill wasnt a very good mix There are times when I have a migraine that comes in too strong and too fast and this tablet doesnt workThats when I take my Maxalt Although I hate the after affects of Maxalt
3729,Fioricet,Headache,10,42093,35,I have suffered from migraines for as long as I can remember Tried everything then my Dr Gave me Fioricet and I love it gets rid of migraines when Im out I will use Ibuprofen as I AM a recovering Addict and dont want to rely solely on this medicine to get rid of headaches No more ER visits for this chick
3731,Fioricet,Headache,10,42065,41,Like many others have suffered from tension andor migraine headaches since I was a child age or so My mother and father both had histories of tension andor migraine headaches I was prescribed initially fiorinal around age and then changed to fioricet by my neurologist due to upper gi problems gerd Until I had this medication prescribed my life was controlled by my headaches I can remember as a teenager feeling that I couldnt be away from home for very long due to fearing a headache would come on No child or adult should have to feel that way I wish that all the physicians who are uncomfortable prescribing this medicine would read these comments Thank you
3732,Fioricet,Headache,10,42015,65,MAGIC I never leave home without at least two pills in my purse Ive suffered from migraines since I was now not that long but long enough and have been on almost everything Ive been basically turned away by two neurologists because they have nothing left to try with me I refuse to take any kind of heavy narcotic unless I am forced to go to the ER and I was finally prescribed Fioricet and it worked like no other Instead of having to drop everything I was doing when the migraine started to lay in a dark room I was able to take pills depending on the severity and go on with my day like nothing had happened Its absolutely amazing HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
3733,Fioricet,Headache,10,42012,31,It is the best medicine that really works control my tension headache One tablet is enough to make the discomfort go away in a matter of minutes It is taken only when necessary However not all doctors recommend this med because it could be habit forming and might damage the liver At times there are doctors that over reacts even though you tell them that you only take it as needed and that you were careful On the other hand there are the smart doctors that prescribes it PRN as treatment for headache
3734,Fioricet,Headache,9,41968,37,This works well if I take it when the Migraine is just starting It will stop the migraine but I may still get a head ache but it wont be debilitating
3735,Fioricet,Headache,10,41927,47,I just took this medicine for the first time I have had severe migraines for years I cant believe how well this medicine is working already I have chronic sinusitis degenerative disc decease and TMJ I also have braces and just got them tightened so I havent even wanted to get out of bed lately I am so excited I found this medicine I cant believe I was never told about it before
3736,Fioricet,Headache,1,41924,27,Didnt even touch my migraine Ive tried just about everything for chronic severe migraines including daily propranolol Imitrex Maxalt narcotics etc Only Midrin has helped Ran out and tried this Didnt help Didnt notice any side effects
3737,Fioricet,Headache,10,41912,87,Fioricet is the only medication that will quickly and effectively get rid of my migrainetension headaches Ive tried multiple other medications treatments without relief Without them Im totally incapacitated in bed no lights nausea and frequent emergency room visits So far without signs of dependence withdrawals or addiction However I despise the looks or comments at certain pharmacies like youre an addict Obviously these people have never experienced severe headaches
3739,Fioricet,Headache,7,41874,46,This medicine helps I would say it knocks the pain down of a migraine from a to a very quickly Not sure what I would do without it
3740,Ogen,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,40312,13,Ive been using Ogen for the past years and really cannot live a normal life without it I had a total hysterectomy at years of age was on Premarin for about years knowing the ingredients then on Estratest for about years before going cold turkey without anything for years Those years were hard I just wanted to go to the top of a building and jump off I tried other natural things but they didnt work I finally went to a Doctor in Canada to get an prescription for Ogen Now I discover that it is no longer being manufactured Someone needs to start remanufacturing it PLEASE
3741,Ogen,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,40213,15,I have used Ogen for over years following a hysterectomy at years of age It is absolutely wonderful I have experienced no side effects I take the name brand because generics dont work for me Following Hurricane Katrina when my doctors office was destroyed and I didnt know where to contact her I went without my Ogen for three months I then learned just how beneficial it was to my quality of life healthwiseI am distressed to learn from my pharmacist that Ogen is no longer being manufactured At least it isnt available in the Jackson Mississippi area Im going to try the generic brand as a last resort
3742,Fioricet,Headache,9,43019,1,Effective for migraine and tension headaches can cause slurring of speech and over anxiety especially on maximum dose
3743,Fioricet,Headache,1,43018,1,Was given foricet at ER for Tension headache and I suffer from severe anxiety I immediately had tachycardia fast heart beat after taking this drug it got rid of my headache but it left me miserable with my anxiety never taking this again
3744,Fioricet,Headache,9,43013,2,I started getting severe headaches months after starting a new job I loved I was only getting between hrs of sleep a night after being on my feet hrs a day Artificial lights were like swords in my brain during the day and towards the evening were intolerable Noise was also making my head hurt worse to the point where I was throwing up from the pain I was given Topamax and had great results for a week Then tapered to better results than not taking it I was still getting the headaches daily My doctor prescribed Fioricet PRN along with Propanalol to take with the Topamax as a preventative measure What a relief What a difference I had a Doctor of Osteopathy who immediately knew what to prescribe via my symptoms
3745,Fioricet,Headache,10,42987,9,I have had a pounding throbbing migraine for days a terrible throbbing pain on the left side of my head I tried everything under the sun imitrex over the counter everything the only thing that worked for me is fioricet it took away my migraine in an instant I suffer from anxiety so that caused my tension migraines this medicine puts anxiety at easy and your migraine completely gone Please dont be in pain anymore go to your doctor and get fioricet I feel for all the migraine sufferers I have been dealing with it for half my life dont be in pain anymore this medicine will really work also if you have moderate to severe anxiety like I do hope this helps
3746,Fioricet,Headache,8,42950,8,It helps to knock out the pain and reduce the tension in the head and eyes associated with migraine but it appears to be somewhat of a controlled substance or at least one that theyre wary of so Im not sure what else I can do to be migraine free Ive tried Botox twice I now know that does not work for me I tried Effexor as a prophylactic Not working This is hormone related so theres not a heck of a lot I can do here but just keep asking for more pills Not ideal but worn out My eyeball hurts right now just looking at this screen
3748,Fioricet,Headache,10,42896,13,This is the best medicine for tension headaches bar none Big pharma has tried to get it banned for years because it is so cheap and effective which is a treat to their vastly over priced dangerous and ineffective alternatives IF YOU HAVE HEADACHE OF ANY KIND I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO TRY THIS MIRACLE FOR ME MEDICATION
3751,Fioricet,Headache,9,42866,4,I take this almost every days due to my unbearable tension headaches This past time I am Rxd tabs every hrs I took my entire daily taking which is what max and I took them all but staggered and I ended up in the ER with a shot of Naloxone from overdosing on the butalbital Not sure naloxone works on barbsbut they gave it to me anyway I was so out of it I couldnt see or talk right Im someone who takes benzosor used to that is so I can handle that type of feeling BUTat the end of the day this medication DOES work for tension headaches and helps me sleep the caffeine in my opinion is cancelled out by the butalbital I take the non scheduled no codeine version although I wish I was id cut back on em
3753,Fioricet,Headache,1,42850,13,I was prescribed fioricet for migraines Not only didnt it help the migraine fioricet caused my heart rate to skyrocket due to the amount of caffeine it contains and gave me an absolutely WICKED rebound headache the next day In fact the rebound headache was worse than the original migraine Needless to say I threw the rest of the pills down the toiletFioricet is also EXTREMELY addicting if taken more than times per month Astonishingly I was prescribed to tablets EVERY hours for migraines with NO WARNING whatsoever from my doctor about how addicting this medication is Thank God it didnt work for me or else Id be a fioricet addict facing withdrawal whenever the drug isnt taken It should be taken off the market
3755,Fioricet,Headache,6,42815,4,Yesgreat medicine for migraines However the barbiturate in this drug can be bad Before I knew I was bipolar I took this medicine It made me go mentally insane for about a week out of the month Something in my brain did not like it
3757,Fioricet,Headache,6,42735,10,I have a constant headache with migraines as well I use this when my headache gets really bad and this brings it back to tolerable level and helps me sleep I only use this as needed Average less than a week

3762,Fioricet,Headache,8,42591,22,I was first prescribed fioricet for hormonal headaches during my pregnancy It was so effective and helped ease the pain It did make me drowsy I still use it for chronic headaches asneeded The only thing I wish for is that it would work a little more quickly It takes minhr for my headaches to ease off Great help allaround though

3772,Fioricet,Headache,10,41507,44,Have been using Fioricet when required for years I always go too long before taking it for tension headaches Usually one pill does wonders and I can get on with my day Will continue to use it as needed

3783,Fioricet,Headache,10,41274,66,Ive been taking Fioricet for years Ive had migraines for years I was when it was first prescribed for me before that my life revolved around my headaches Fioricet changed my life for the incredibly better Im third generation migraine sufferer so I suppose theres an argument for a genetic predisposition Up until I was headaches were an almost daily occurrence since I was very young lasting from hours to days So many things triggered them that I wont even begin to make a list I am careful about the acetaminophen component which seems to be the main potential negative health issue Rebound headaches can also occur but its nothing compared to the life enhancing benefits at least for me
3785,Fioricet,Headache,10,41159,41,Im new to the throbbing headache life Went to emergency yesterday after having had a headache that would not go away after it started days from then Chiropractor exam and such checked out Eye doctor checked out Was alternating between two pain medicines during that week in order to manage the pain ER doctor prescribed me Fioricet Im keeping a log of it as I gostarted with one pill so far to see how it went Took first pill at am and hour later the pain was numb enough to make me comfortable This morning I took it again at am since the pain was starting again minutes later the pain is gone Im really liking this medicine so far

3788,Fioricet,Headache,8,41010,26,My son has suffered with severe migraines since the age of when he was diagnosed with seizures For the better part of the next yrs I had to watch him suffer because we were told there was nothing to be done other than diet etc No one wants to see their child suffer At last we found a wonderful doctor who first prescribed Midrin which really helped but then of course insurance didnt want to pay for it anymore and suggested Fioricet pills at the most and I have my happy son back
3789,Fioricet,Headache,10,40984,29,I have been suffering from headaches and shoulder strain for years I finally found a medicine that works For me it is like taking Vicodin without the grogginess It takes the pain away and helps me relax Finally a medicine that WORKS
3790,Fioricet,Headache,10,40977,14,Im a migraine sufferer and allergic to the triptans what is generally prescribed for migraine relief ie Imitrex and its family so my doctor prescribed Fioricet and it works great for me I no longer have to rely on Excedrine and taking six of them to find relief Two Fioricet and Im typically good to go The Tylenol content doesnt bother me because I was taking a lot more with the Excedrine Im also on mg of Topamax twice daily for control which is all Ive ever found to work and Ive been quite the guinea pig there
3792,Fioricet,Headache,10,40931,22,It is the best medicine for headaches caused by TMJ and degenerative disc diease I usually never have to take the secound dose I did at first but now I dont Dont take it everyday only as needed Works good for leg aches also
3793,Fioricet,Headache,9,40882,16,I am yrs old I started getting headaches when I was about yrs old This is the only medicine Ive found that will help my headaches
3794,Fioricet,Headache,10,40792,27,Fioricet is truly a wonder drug Im had migraines since I was now and if you take it right when the headache starts lay down for minutes youll feel rejuvenated BUT Fioricet can cause rebound headaches headaches that one gets when they are used to taking a medicine for a while so while it may be hard to just take one pill when your head is throbbing and you have things to do it will pay off in the long run So try to alternate with other medicines in there so your body doesnt get used it Because I rebounded from Fioricet which means I have chronic daily migraines no fun In conclusion great medicine
3795,Fioricet,Headache,10,40779,6,Helped tremendously with headaches but I am wary of how much Tylenol is in it My doctor said no more then a day I take one because I worry about liver damage It really takes my headache away but when it returns I wont take another one

3834,Fioricet,Headache,8,39627,55,I used Fioricet for years to not only treat my headaches but to help with tense aches and pains in my shoulders It was the only thing that worked and allowed me to continue with my daily routine I did notice that after taking it for such a long time I experienced some of the withdrawls I would reccomend taking it but follow how your doctor says to take your dosages even if you think you are starting to have a quotheadachequot it might just be a rebound reaction
3835,Fioricet,Headache,9,39616,45,I have been taking Fioricet as needed for about years I love it If Fioricet doesnt help nothing does I do not find it to be habit forming at all I do find that if i take it for too many days in a row it is not as effective and then I suffer from rebound headaches

3863,Bismuth subsalicylate,Indigestion,10,42624,0,Ive found pepto Bismol really useful for when I get acid reflux It really helps to calm and cool my stomach Anytime Im feeling nauseous its the first thing I go toI also take pepto bismol when Ive eaten too much as I do have a binge eating disorder It helps prevent the reflux before it startsI only take it when Im experiencing symptoms
3864,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea,9,42413,8,As a college student with moderate IBS symptomsoverly sensitive stomach sharing one bathroom with four people can REALLY be scary Instead of having to climb out the window and run into the woods or bang on the door begging for mercy popping a couple Pepto Tablets can REALLY help relieve the symptoms of impending doom Mellows my stomach out within minutes of taking doesnt taste bad and gives me a sense of safety Sometimes your stomach still gets upset much later which at that point is completely fineit has to come out sometime right Generally speaking its usually great and I never get the upset stomach I recommend to anyone its saved me many times and can do the same for you
3865,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea,9,42371,6,Excellent stomach flu remedy Stops symptoms quickly For bad digestive issues such as the stomach flu the max liquid works better than caplets or chewable tablets Gives fast effective relief
3867,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea Chronic,2,42060,5,Terrible yes it will stop your diharea but it will just hold everything in amp make you nauses amp after the pill wears over Diharea again
3874,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,9,41247,35,Wonderful prep Had slight abdomen pain towards the end It did exactly what it was meant for It really was not bad at all The only reason it didnt get a ten was because it was a lot to drink I chugged some Sipped it And it took hours to finish but I like this because you do it at your own pace And once you are empty No more loose stools
3875,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,40904,18,I had stomach cramps within minutes of starting my first glass of Golytely and started my first bowel movement before I could even finish my first glass Aside from the nasty taste and the stomach cramps I have to say this really works I think my colon will be completely clear for the colonoscopy tomorrow morning at the rate Im going and thats saying a lot since Im disabled and have zero control down there in that area
3876,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,10,40770,40,I had been constipated for roughly days after quitting drinking this I foolishly upped my fiber intake by way more than I should have and got myself backed upI went to the doctor and he prescribed me GoLytely which is a terribly ironic name for such a medicine I already have passed stools and feel a lot better The taste is awful though Its like lemonade made with one lemon no sugar and salty well water
3878,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,10,40172,14,Worked very well
3881,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,6,42902,15,I wouldnt normally review this type of thing but I had read every horror story on the internet before I took it It didnt taste quotgoodquot and everyone is different but it was nowhere near as awful as I expected This is not medical advice but as other people have suggested chill it so its cold when you drink it use a straw As per my doctor I rinsed my mouth between glasses with ginger ale Based on what Id read I ate a low residue diet for the days before toast bananas jello yogurt applesauce and was done with the process in hours Do some stretches to move your stomach aroundMy problem turned out to be revealed thru the endoscopy not colonoscopy But this wasnt among my top worst experiences in life
3882,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,42899,7,Had to do my prep before the doctor had to go mining I chose the unflavored Used water at room temperature I would recommend this Taste a little like salty water Dont refrigerate it or you will get the chills It will clean you out I felt great I believe from the Go Lytly alone Felt great getting the pipes cleaned
3883,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,7,42860,8,I have to drink two bottles of this stuff day cleanse and this is my second night I started drinking it with a lemonade powder I LOVE lemon anything lol anyway to me it tasted horrible with the lemon so I tried it by itself and it taste like baking soda and water Last night at the beginning I felt a little bloated and a very little nausea after things started moving my stomach settled down I am drinking two jugs because my first test I used something else and did not work as well as it should have I pray this will be the last time for a long long while It does do the job
3885,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,2,42787,5,This cleanse was actual living hell The taste is horrible I do suggest mixing it with powerade or gatorade and it masks the flavor slightly You feel so bloated and shaky and it took forever to go to the bathroom Up all night with the shakes and going to the bathroom Also makes you gag and dont be fooled because the first taste isnt that bad Avoid this drug at all costs
3886,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,42709,4,wow this stuff will clean engines inside and out ha ha nasty taste but very effective wont do it again i can assure you that
3888,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1,42677,8,Its effective but it is horrible Terrible taste and too much to drink Highly recommend Suprep instead taste is not bad and only ounces at night and ounces the next morning
3889,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1,42641,9,Man this is disgusting the flavour is from the depths of hell
3890,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,8,42604,16,If you have problems for the taste I would recommend getting some Gatorade and mixing with it instead of the flavor pacet and water Tastes times better and the electrolytes help
3891,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,3,42595,17,This stuff is SO gross Ive managed to drink down the Gallon so far and NO bowel movement It tastes so hideous I feel like i might puke Not sure how I can keep drinking this
3893,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10,42560,12,I know many people have trouble with the whole colonoscopy experience but I really dont know why To me it its a very comical experience Drink a glass every or so minutes and soon youll be timing for the bathroom about as frequently I liked the added note on the GoLYTELY to jiggle your tummy to help remove extra poo I have to admit after the whole GoLYTELY experience I wanted to watch what the whole fuss was about Watching the scope do its thing was amazing Now that I have to do it all again I will not drink quite as fast I wasted some by projectile vomiting some of it back up also comical but I will dance and jiggle my bowels about to get them as clean as I canMy biggest concern is what flavor to get Pineapple NOT
3894,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,8,42550,10,I was told I could add the little packets of crystal light lemonade to the Golytely to make it more tolerable I would put a packet with the glass you are drinking to measure the strength of the lemon flavor
3897,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,9,42458,76,After reading all the horror stories I wanted to cancel procedure so thought Id share my experience Honestly NOT THAT BAD Took as directed added nothing for flavor Tasted very salty just a swig of Apple juice after each oz dose every mins Had no side effects No bloating No gas pains No discomfort Had only broth on prep day Had only a chicken omelet afternoon prior to prep No cramping with bowel movements Procedure was a breeze without the quotwindquot Hope this helps ease someones anxiety
3899,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,3,42267,23,Horrible Just finished the first half and I am dreading literally dreading the second half I threw up half of it and feel sicker then a dog with a splitting migrane
3901,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,7,42150,37,This was much easier than expected First I went on low fiber diet two days before taking it One day from mednight before procedure I went on clear liquid diet with no solid food Then took GL at about PM No reaction until seventh ounce glass of GL Then it did the job its designed to do No pains or cramps The solution was cold and I got each glass down as fast as comfortably possible Taste I didnt notice anything bad about it and did not add any flavoring Its like drinking a lot of water Maybe they should have a beer flavor to make it go down even easier
3906,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Clostridial Infection,9,40031,19,I have had quite remarkable relief of severe bloating and sluggish bowel motility This had continued for three full months without relief I was even begging for surgery to find out what was wrong My abdomen was so distended that my lung capacity per spirometer was to of normal I got winded just climbing stairs at home and I could not sing Im a choir director I could not sit upright in a chair or car and I felt about months pregnant I had been on antibiotics for several weeks before this problem started Within days of starting prescription strength lactobacillus I was back to wearing most of my regular clothes was able to do a full day of errands without stopping and could sing again and dropped pounds
3907,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,43063,0,I have type diabetes and because of high blood sugar levels I used to suffer from yeast infections at least twice a year A friend told me about acidophilus pills and I am forever grateful I take them by mouth a couple of times a month to prevent yeast infections and if I ever feel one coming on or just generally feel any kind of irritation I will break a pill in half and wet it a bit so its more comfortable and insert into the affected area You definitely need to get comfortable with yourself to do that but its so worth it It wont completely break down and might come back out after a couple days but it works Taking too many by mouth gave me a little bloating and gas but Ill take that over the painful infections I hope this helps
3915,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,42486,72,I suffered a year battle with BV I tried several prescription medications numerous antibiotics oral amp vaginal suppositories Whatever doctors said I did with no success After lots of research I came upon acidophilus and its amazing curing benefitsThe chronic BV went away and stayed away I just purchased over the counter store brand acidophilus tablets Nothing fancy or prescribed I inserted acidophilus tablet pills vaginally for days then tablet for more days and had immediate relief and results After the st week was completed vaginally I then started taking one pill daily orally to maintain a healthy PH I would highly recommend this to any woman suffering with BV
3916,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,9,42459,12,Worked quite well no side effects took half a caplet X daily to equal the recommended dose of caplet per day to try and avoid any stomach discomfort
3917,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Constipation,8,42286,7,Acidophilus is now the only supplement medication I take to manage constipation which is a sideeffect of opiod medications which Ive been taking for a number of years Prior to my adding acidophilus capsule form to my regime constipation was a chronic problem causing me constant concern and trying various remedies none of which worked until I came upon acidophilus This has truly worked wonders
3918,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1,42222,2,Miserable bloated abdominal cramps
3919,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,42211,4,YES LAcidophilus is excellent for IBS particularly for the weird somewhat abstract and oblique stomach uncomfortableness However I find that taking two capsules to times a day preferably on an empty stomach is the best way I use LAcidophilus as an adjunct to my onceaday regular more comprehensive probiotic Always store refrigerated
3920,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Diarrhea,1,42161,8,Terrible quick negative response with loud stomach growling and rd Day Evening blast of Diarrhea keeping me in bathroom with gas bloating Very uncomfortable physically No choice but to stop Disappointed hoping so much for help regulating system and regular daily normal functions
3921,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42110,7,I first saw this on TV adds for yogurt I bought the pills and after just a few days I feel great I used to get pain in my lower back not any more I havent even told my doctor yet This stuff is great
3922,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,42104,43,I have suffered with constipation for years after having a major surgery The pain would be in my lower back and made it difficult for me to stand particularly in the early morning I have been taking over the counter acidophilus pills times a day with meals and I dont experience the excruciating pain anymore I carry my pills in purse I highly recommend these tablets
3924,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,41749,46,I have used this for years Women tend to have a hard time with yeast infection during the time of taking antibiotics Well taking this times a day will keep it at bay Also taking it once a day on regular basis helps to keep the yeast in the vagina from growing I have used this for oral thrush also Eating yogurts will take care of that
3926,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,8,41303,55,Having yeast flares monthly for months Nothing clearing it completely however Acidophilus placed vaginally really relieves symptoms Taking a probiotic orally really helps as well Hoping to stay on top of it this time
3927,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9,41104,21,The last year I have suffered greatly from colitis I began researching other treatments and medicines because whatever the doctor gave me did little to combat I was miserable diarrhea nausea cramping especially in the mornings and EVERY time I ate Could not go anywhere without an episode After one week I noticed a difference After weeks nausea and cramping very minimal After weeks I am off ALL other medicines I SWEAR by this
3928,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Clostridial Infection,9,40807,3,Works great
3931,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10,40662,96,I have been on metrinidazole metrogel and varies creams for Bacterial vaginosis and nothing controlled my BV like acidophillis The best brand that I have found is Pectin each capsule has billion good bacterias in them BV is no fun this has really helped me
3932,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,43057,2,I was taking mg of Seroquel XR for months The best part was being able to get a good nightrsquos sleep I had only been getting hrs rest each night My mind would race and it was a struggle to stay in bed I would get up and start cleaning Additionally I would spend hours creating plans to organize my life I had not actually followed any of those plans and I was depressed I took Latuda for a short period but it made my inability to sleep worse Thatrsquos when I was switched to Seroquel I loved the way it helped me feel normal The bad I gained lbs in months I asked to be taken off and started taking Geodon Once again I cannot sleep I am going to ask to go back to Seroquel XR and focus on following a healthy diet
3933,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,43045,3,Ive been on this for years and it is my rock It literally helps me so much I couldnt have made it through high school without it Honestly its what helped me through my suicidal phases I still get them but its not as intense and I dont try and act on it anymore
3934,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,3,43005,3,I had the worst sideeffect from this medication I was originally prescribed it about a year ago for insomnia related to my Bipolar It worked to get me to sleep but eventually I started to have enormous amounts to rectal pain so I went off of it when I stopped cycling I was put on it again this year when my cycling started again and I again had the same pain It was absolutely awful So I am off of it now and never want to be put on it again
3935,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42964,9,I have been taking this drug for a year and a half and it has changed my life Ive tried various drugs and lifestyle treatments over years of great instability and desperation going between breakdown after breakdown Finding the right dose and preparation slow release has not only lifted me from crisis but improved my wellbeing to an all time level It took a little while to adjust In particular it guarantees me a good night sleep and I can up the dose slightly if things slip It has done wonders for my anxiety and given me the stability to really be what I want to beI feel it is important to note that the drug is one part of the picture and mindfulness exercise socialprofessional support etc are important where possible
3936,Seroquel XR,Schizoaffective Disorde,1,42963,1,I have been taking Seroquel XR mg for almost years Before this I was taking low dose regular Seroquel for many years It really helps me manage my schizoaffective disorder I am also taking a doctors prescribed antihistamine hydroxyzine mg because I get hives while on seroquel XR I have noticed male breast growth and hard glandular breast tissue build up under my breast during this year I am also experincing breast pain I am on a calorie restricted diet and have been exercising and lifting weights regularly for the past years and have gained lbs to lbs in weight I have low body fat and can do push ups in a row easily so its not body fat
3938,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42923,6,Great med weight gain yes lbs over months started working out at the gym and watching what I eat and feeling good and hopeful for the future down lbs does feel little of loss motivation at mg trying to lower dose to mg update later
3939,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42909,6,Recently able to get the XR in generic form This has been a complete life changing medication for me It has improved all areas of my condition to a point I am fully capable to manage life without any other assistance
3943,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42882,16,This drug is a wonder drug After years of brutal bipolar symptoms undiagnosed untreated which destroyed my whole life I now take mg at night and now I can have a normal life free of anxiety mood swings bipolar symptoms etc I hold down a responsible fulltime job healthy relationships and friendships I have hobbies I never had any of that before my bipolar destroyed my whole life Seroquel gave it backI hear of people wanting to go off Seroquel Im the opposite I would go to any lengths to make sure I never have to go off it Ill gladly spend the rest of my life on it because it gives me a normal life and I wont risk that for anything Ive been on it years no side effects
3945,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,42875,10,I was on this medication for around years at different doses anywhere from mgs to mgs It was a very good medicine and helped a lot with my anxiety and depression and really calmed me down and was very helpful but the weight gain was a killer I would try to go off over and over and would have to keep going back to it because I would be in such bad shape without it I had a lovehate relationship with it I became prediabetic while on it I finally was able to go off and stay off at one point Its a great drug but the side effects are horrible as far as weight gain
3946,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42868,13,SeroquelXR has changed my life for the better I am currently on mg once daily I also take klonopin before I go to work For the last months I have not had to call out sick from work which was a monthly occurrence before Seroquel I have not had to take a leave of absence in the last year I used to have to take six week leaves a year I feel much more positive about my job and my life in general It has been a game changer for me The only down side is the weight gain It seems to slow your metabolism down and increase your appetite after taking it making it difficult to loose weight I am currently not overweight so the weight gain is a small price to pay I do have to exercise regularly and watch more carefully what I eat
3947,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42854,12,I dont understand all the negative reviews For me this pill has worked well Its calmed me right down and has been blissful at moments Its expensive unfortunately As for weight gain Ive noticed that its pretty neutral Granted Im weaning off of Zoloft as well so who knows but I find with medications with weight gain as a side effect just trying your hardest to eat a well balanced diet will prevent it Its too easy to give up and say oh well Im gonna get fat its very much not the case Dont give up if youre bipolar like me theres a chance you can do a lot with your brain so give it a shot and take your life back I think much more clearly and am more productive The overwhelming tiredness subsided after one week
3948,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,42845,7,I have Bipolar most the time being on Seroquel has helped settle my racing thoughts helps me sleep at night and helps me regulate my moods At times I still get the highs and lows but not as severe without Seroquel The side effects that I get is dry mouth dry skin increased appetite and High Cholestrol Most of the time this medication helps me out
3949,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42836,8,I take this medication for bipolar but it also does wonders for generalized anxiety disorder I have suffered for DECADES with anxiety and panic attacks and SSRIs have stopped working for me When I started taking seroquel it was like I finally saw color in the black and white world I was living in My moods are completely under control and my anxiety is controlled for the most part This medication definitely has side effects Its a tranquilizer It makes you very tired It also made me gain a significant amount of weightbut I would rather deal with the side effects then deal with the horrible anxiety I was living with everyday I take it before bedmake sure youre able to get at least hours of sleep so youre not groggy the next day
3951,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42809,12,Im yrs old have severe RA and been talking seroquel XR at milligrams a night for nearly a year I was diagnosed bipolar years ago but had so much trouble finding a psychiatrist who was caring enough to listen to me like a psychologist AND work as a psychiatrist pill pusher so my diagnosis went treated and untreated on and off for a while BUT since Ive been seeing my doctor regularly and she seems to genuinely care Ive trusted her judgment with her diagnosis and what she thought would help me most besides the weight gain honestly I feel much more stable amp I can deal with the world around me as I see it and havent had any serious depressive episodes or hypomania This medication has worked wonders for me
3953,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,42760,26,I have depression with anxious disitressMy extremely racing thoughts would typically whip me up into a panicky state sometimes with outbursts of irrational anger Seroquel XR works fantastically to ease that racing mind to a more normaland useful pace Side effects are virtually absent the XR doesnt floor me like immediate release Seroquel did I can function and think well Seroquel XR is a good medicine It also helps with my depression

3957,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,42648,42,I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder with psychotic features I was put in intensive out patient care after going to the Emergency Room for intense auditory hallucinations that were so malicious I feared for my own life Lost my job and everything Seroquel has given me hope as well as lorazepam for my anxiety To me seroquel is a miracle drug for its antipsychotic features as well as depression Im having to up the dosage lately because my voices are creeping back in Searching for further pychiactric help but right now Im stable and I thought that would be impossible Sharing a good experience Thanks for reading
3960,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42605,21,This med is pretty wonderful for my bipolar mania and my bipolar depression Only set back is the sedation but at the same time Ive always struggled with anciety so this side effect is okay with me as it helps the anxiety Really saved my life
3961,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,42597,38,I have only been on Seroquel XR for about a week at mg My doctor prescribed it as an adjunct to Remeron to treat anxiety depression paranoia and insomnia I also take gabapentin atenolol and Xanax When the Seroquel XR works it WORKS I can feel it sedating me two hours after I take it Ive been sleeping eight and nine hours a night which has not happened in a very very long time Its effective at neutralizing both anxiety and depression BUT it doesnt last hours for me it only lasts about Once it wears off my anxiety and depression return with a vengeance Makes for a very rough or hours until I can take it again
3962,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42567,20,First of all let me start by saying that I hear that this is an expensive drug because of how new it is Luckily for me perhaps lol my insurance considera me catastrophic due to my checkered past and pays the entire price because they want me to take this medication and stfu lol Since taking Seroquel XR my life has improved so much and I really have never felt more stable in my life Ive tried anticonvulsants and other antipsychotics and they have not worked for me This medication really does to my surprise The only downfall is that Ive gained pounds taking it but any antipsychotic will do that Strongly recommend Seroquel XR
3963,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,4,42527,15,I really noticed a negative difference when comparing the XR version to the regular Seroquel It took longer to kick in and made me so drowsy at work that I felt like I was drunk I think I was taking mg When I went back to regular Seroquel mg put me to sleep fast and made a difference in stabilizing my mood without me feeling too drowsy to function the next day
3966,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,7,42469,15,I was prescribed seroquel xr for Bipolar depression My dr started me on mg and I am gradually increasing the dosage its been about weeks and I am currently taking mg I will agree that it has helped the hopelesness feelings and suicidal thoughts Which is a plus but the zombie like feeling and dry mouth are tough I have a job that requires constant activity its hard to keep up have to definitely slow down My Dr advised me that these side affects are all normal and eventually I will get used to it cant wait for this to happen
3967,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,42459,23,It was mainly prescribed as a sleep aid in addition to its antidepressant qualities I was on regular Seroquel and now on XL as I have trouble staying asleep Its slightly better Im getting hours of sleep a night I am not usually groggy or snowed by this maybe once per doses Im ok with it Only downside is cost XL is brand
3968,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42452,13,Been on Quetiapine MR for around months mg at night Found it far less sedating than Olanzapine Its been a miracle for my Bipolar absolutely no depression and no manic episodes Yeah I put on weight but the effects on my mood and mental health have been incredible
3970,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42441,20,OK its only early days day to be exact on mg morning and night Its amazing After reading all the horror stories of the tranquilliser effects zombie like statescravings Its an understatement when I said I was petrified what effect this would have on me First day within an hour of taking it I slept for six hours woke up feeling fine refreshed even Then dosed up in the evening at again asleep by slept like a baby am Woke feeling energised lighter happier No drowsiness or brain fuzz I feel so much more positive about life in generalI feel so blissfully normal Day still napping within hrs of dose for hrs max but I could push through it And still sleeping all night
3971,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,42390,33,This medication has been a real lifesaver I had struggled with heavy depressions interspersed with hypomania for a few years before I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder for which I was prescribed this The initial mg did nothing except be an overrated sleep pill but the boost to mg for bipolar depression helped begin to mellow me out and a few weeks later I was starting to experience a life free of devastating mood swings Ive read horror stories online but I experienced nothing of the sort actually lost weight in the past few months Its a shame theres risks with longterm use I would happily take this forever otherwise these past few months have been nice and happy and productive for me thanks to this
3972,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,2,42388,13,Im currently and a male My depression has only worsened since and before my initial diagnosis of depression and generalized social and quotacutequot anxiety years ago Ive been in a major depression for at least five years tried to kill myself twice and am unable to take care of myself Ive lived alone since I left for college in I still live alone here Ive been on any SSRI I can think of so this was a last resort med Seroquel has made me much too tired to work or do anything else The only stars I gave it relate to the reduced anxiety when Im ACTUALLY AWAKE Other than that Im more numb than I ever and are at risk of losing my job
3973,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42373,11,I was on citolopram celexa lithium mg daily and olanzapine mg and a lot of benzos A state run mental health clinic opened in a local town so I stopped seeing the private psychiatrist and started to attend the public clinic The psychiatrist was revolutionary She immediately stopped the antidepressant because it was elevating mood into mania She dropped lithium to one dose at night to aid kidney wear and tear She stopped olanzapine because I was still having mild persistent psychosis and put me on mg of quetiapine seroquel The first week was tough I was very nauseous and sleepy but once my body adjusted it was much better The mix of quetiapine and lithium is really working for me
3975,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,42362,64,Ive been on Venlafaxine mg along with Quetiapine Mirtazapine and Pregabalin for Major Depression for around yearsAugmentation therapy works for me Its not perfect but this level of Venlafaxine along with the other meds has kept me alive Im not getting better but Im certainly more stable and not going downhill and not suicidal So in conclusion dont be scared of meds they may just save your life
3976,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,10,42360,19,Absolutely amazing drug Has quite literally saved my life Pity I need to lie to the Australian government about having bipolar to get it prescribed No doubt this is stopping many thousands of Australians from getting access to it Seriously I went from suicidal for severalmonths to absolutely normal in one dose One dose Talk to your doctor about this if anti depressants are not working for you Understand it may require you to lie about having bipolar
3977,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,42319,41,My experience on Seroquel nearly cost me my job as it turned me into a ZOMBIE Since going off the drug I am fully functional My head is clear and I have energy to do thingsI cannot believe my Dr prescribed me an antipsychotic drug such as seroquel Colleagues observing me thought I had undergone a major personality disorder I have been off it for a month now and not missing it one bit
3978,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,42318,51,I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder months ago i am but I do not have that Instead I have BPD and depression I was taking olanzapine which took away my entire life I could barely do anything but for the past days with seroquel it has almost the opposite effect Together with Prozac I have felt more motivated and less suicidal Also Im able to control my anxiety and I have more control over my behaviour I also have trouble focusing but this has helped me focus on therapy a lot more Sleep not great but Im only on mg I only sleep for about hours and then wake up and keep going back to sleep This is the first drug thats given me hope
3979,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,1,42302,7,This was the absolute worst medication i have ever taken What a nightmare To begin with I was taking Duloxetine mg x a day Wellburtin Xl mg x a day Valium mg x a day morphine mg x a day oxycodone mg x a day I was doing just fine or do I thought I had a change of Doctors due to the fact that my Doctor left this practice Not sure the reason for this medication Never Again After starting that medication once it really got in my system my worst fear came to reality I totally went outside my mind to the point my daughter was so scared of my behavior she called the EMS Upon arrival at the ER after blood work was told I was overly medicated Never Never Again Awful
3980,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,42297,6,I use Seroquel XR in addition to Tegretol XR and Geodon It is sort of the adjunct to these primary medications But it does its job at keeping me stable when the base medication mix falls short
3981,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42285,16,I have been taking seroquel for a little over a year and a half now and it has been the best thing for me I started off at mg when my mania was insanely uncontrollable But after months I was able to go down to and ever since its been perfect because I dont fight the drowsiness in the mornings and get a great nights rest I did gain weight only pounds but I have always been extremely athletic sport collegiate athlete and it didnt really affect me at all Just as long as it keeps the manicdepressive episodes on lock down I think I can handle a curvier bodyI seriously reccommend this if you can handle a little weight gain
3983,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1,42822,13,I have taken Risendronate for only weeks and have severe bone pain in my hands I cannot bear the pain I also have burning sensation in my throat I was given alendronate to start with and they also made me feel so ill I wont be taking any more I really dont know what to do as I dont want the injection or infusion
3984,Risedronate,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1,42768,9,Took first pill morning of Oct amp that night went to turn over in bed amp felt the most excruciating pain in my lower back radiating through my chest that it took my breath away In tears went to my regular dr who prescribed muscle relaxers amp home from work for days I also experienced flulike symptoms a recurrence of my acid reflux tiredness increased insomnia amp just felt lousy Reluctantly took the nd dose in Nov didnt experience the back pain but still have episodes of that back spasm but very slight but did experience all the other side effects Im so done with this med and now my gyno wants me to take Prolia Reading forums and its side effects I am scared to death especially since its a sixmonth dosage

3992,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,10,42091,20,I am allergic to Fosamax My doctor gave me an Atelvia sample to try and I found I had no side effects from this medicine I credit this to its timerelease function
3993,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1,41992,28,My doctor gave me samples to use while I awaited my insurance to approve After taking the first dosage in approximately hours I was in the hospital Side effects for me were extreme bone pain indigestion Doctors thought I was having a heart attack
3994,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1,41980,59,Took this medication for months From the start I had problems tolerating the medicine It made me nauseous The worst side effect was the bone pain
3997,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,8,41585,27,Good result
3998,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,3,41520,82,I took Actonel as directed for four months Each time my body ached so badly that I could barely walk and had to take time off from work I took myself off the medication because I just couldnt function I go back to my doctor tomorrow Im sure Ill be scolded

4001,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,4,40671,103,I took Actonel for months Im yrs young and active One day each month after taking Actonel I had flulike symptoms for months and then it got better however I experienced esophagus burning
4003,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,5,39986,93,By the end of the first day I was very lethargic and had abdominal cramps and bloating followed by diarrhea Throughout the night and all through the second day I experienced flulike symptoms relieved slightly with aspirin but continued with abdominal tenderness and discomfort as well as very lethargic By the third day the muscle aches were gone but the abdominal tenderness continued Appetite did go down Hopefully there is truth to the first dose being the most difficult in regards to side effects
4004,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,4,39926,91,First day no symptoms Next day a bit achy But the next day felt bloated and nauseous The achy flulike symptoms were gone but for the next week I felt sick constipated and had no appetite

4006,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,42279,57,I have taken it for PTSD at night for a long time Im able to sleep without having horrific nightmares There is weight gain but that boosts me to eat healthy and exercise which helps my depression klonipin to help with daytime anxiety and Seroquel before bed are the two drugs that keep me sane and able to live a normal life
4008,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,42242,33,Hate this med Constantly sick on it Stomach pain severe diarrhea passing out severe dizziness and unable to wake up Hungry for food all the time Nasty taste in mouth Thirsty all the time Cant motivate myself to do anything This was on the lowest dose available Wont take it ever again dont care what my doctor says No way
4009,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,2,42235,10,Took Seroquel XR for about months experienced help with sleep issues for about a week before that wore off Gained at least lbs in this time frame due to increased appetite and general weight gain due to the drug Never really seemed to help my bipolar disorder the other medicines I take do that
4012,Seroquel XR,Depression,3,42208,20,In the beginning I was on mg of seroquel not extended release for years Got pregnant they took me off I moved provinces they ended up putting me back on a smaller dose mg sleeping wise I would go to sleep right away and stay asleep all night For the past months they decided to put me on mg seroquel xl now it takes me hours to fall asleep and I wake up constantly throughout the night and have a hard time falling back asleep I feel like xl does not work near as good depression wise and sleeping wise
4013,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42197,44,This medication completely changed my lifeMy diagnosis is mixed rapidcycling bipolar disorder with psychotic features Before my regimine I would suffer a week of depression followed by a day of dangerous mixed affective episode followed by a few hours of euphoria before the process wouls begin all over again I had ruminating and intrusive thoughts panic atacks anxiety extreme guilt dissociation and suicidal ideation and a few nearattemptsBut within weeks of the therapeutic dose my mood stabilized my anxiety dropped off my obsessive and intrusive ruminations relinquished their hold and unexpectedly I gained a spectrum of emotions I didnt even know I lacked and that was the best thing of allTruly lifealtering
4014,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,2,42176,13,I went from talking mgs of Cymbalta to taking mgs of Seroquel XR just over one year ago I fortunately did not suffer from any if the initial side effects that Ive now researched amp have learned are really common when starting this medication However month ago Im not sure why but I ended up missing nightly doses What I experienced was nothing short of being in hell literally I physically was incapable of movement getting up to simply get to the restroom was near impossible every muscle in my body was weak amp near useless I couldnt do anything but remain in a fetal position curled up on my side for the duration of over hours My head was cloudy confused amp unable to process any thought After this experience I want off
4015,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,5,42142,19,Not bad but the weight gain and how tired it made me eventually led me to go off of it
4016,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,7,42109,7,I lost touch with reality for quite a while I mainly use this as a sleep aid but I am a paranoid schizophrenic As far as symptoms of my schizophrenia it helps However whenever its about time to take my dose I notice my condition worsening a lot If I take it late I am loopy and a bit delusion but I hold a steady job that requires us to work late some days Also if I am just having an overall bad day it seems to not help my symptoms at all I am pretty sure I would be a lot worse without this medication My insurance doesnt cover it but I got a card from the doctor making my prescription only cost around bucks If I didnt have that card it would be about bucks with my work insurance or something with none
4017,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,42102,23,For years I took seroquel in various doses throughout the given day I was prescribed Seroquel XR about years ago for Anxiety and Bipolar l Since then it has been very effective I did not gain weight at all The only drawback is it does cause dizziness and sleepiness Therefore I sometimes opt to take it later than prescribed pm instead of
4018,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,42100,21,At first I hated this medication made me really tired feelings of non reality and weight gain The doctor who put me on it said to wait and give it a chance Im glad I did I use it to sleep at night at some point I will reduce it but its great for now I have very restful sleeps but am unable to remember my dreams I am bipolar and although I am on other medication for it I believe that Seroquel has been key in my mood stability I take mg every night and mg PRN for anxiety if needed Although I get tired on it it does slow down my thoughts
4020,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,9,42066,5,Works great for me
4021,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,42055,91,Seroquel XR worked very well for me with a combination of Seroquel and Zoloft together Ive been well for over years now Usually I would fall in to a depression with in a year just taking an antidepressent Because my body would build a tolerance to the medications I know this medicine isnt for everyone but Ive had a very good experience and Im stable and happy
4022,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,9,42012,22,I have been taking this for five years and have never been better I think you just have to find what works for you My Psych Doc is the best
4023,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,7,42000,10,When I was I was put on mgday before bed time and within months I gained pounds It worked super well to get rid of my hallucinations including the tactile ones but it made me extremely zombielike My grades slipped at school and I slept as soon as I got home till the next morning The first day I slept hours This medicine made me so hungry all the time and no matter how much I ate I was never full
4024,Seroquel XR,Schizoaffective Disorde,6,41985,2,Unfortunately after more than a year pervasive stuff like weight gain increased lipids diabetes all started to be present Great for a while but I started toned more of it to deal with psychotic symptoms and the sedative nature of it got in the way Swapped to paliperidone ER which is more focused on the psychotic symptoms and doing well without the sedation
4025,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,41971,64,I was prescribed seroquel mg for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I could only take it for two days I took it as prescribed before bedtime I almost crashed my truck several times on my way to work and I had to pull over on the shoulder to sleep on my way home from work Day was a Saturday I slept for hours I cant function at all on this
4026,Seroquel XR,Major Depressive Disorde,9,41971,22,Seroquel for depression isnt heard of much Im on it and yes at first it was horrible Head spins and just like motion sickness But I was advised to stick it out and did Approx weeks it settled down I take it for BiPolar the racing mind no sleep or little sleep With Seroquel I sleep a nights rest My mind isnt active at all Im on mg A bit tired of a morning but if you are up early which can be hard the effects wear off sooner I wont swap to any other I tried Zyprexa but Im sticking with Seroquel
4030,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,5,41905,15,Worked but made me drowsy and put on weight
4031,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,41844,55,Ive only been on Seroquel for weeks but I have had a largely positive experience I have had a diagnosis of depression for about ten years and was using Cipralex Lexapro I came off Cipralex twice and both times I became very depressed Even on Cipralex my mood was constantly changing so I went to see a psychiatrist who thinks I may have Cyclothymia or bipolar so started me on mg of Seroquel Initially I was very groggy but have gotten over that Ive also gained a stone in weight But my mood has really stabilised for the first time I feel happy confident and passionate I no longer have a million thoughts in my head so can focus better Hopefully this continues

4035,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,41677,111,I am presently in hospital and have been put on Seroquel XR As previously commented the low dosages cause lethargy and sleepiness However I am not nearly as suicidal as I was I have hope for the future and have not been on for more than a few days I am optimistic that once I have reached the proper dosage that I will once again enjoy life as I once did Paxil Effexor and a number of other antidepressants worsened by symptoms over time andor never did do much for the depressive symptoms in the first place This medicine is worth trying if you are extremely depressed or suicidal
4037,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,41611,66,Works like a charm It was prescribed for me for Bipolar I disorder as part of my cocktail of meds especially for symptoms involving lack of sleep I have been struggling with sleep problems for so many years and this works great for me at mg It even helps with depression and anxiety temporarily I feel a lot calmer which is definitely needed for me especially at night It helps with racing thoughts and voices as well No more quotnoisequot in my head at night for most part
4038,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,41598,70,I have had Bipolar DisorderPersonality Disorder and severe depression for about years and have tried just about every medicine there is A recent setback had me in hospital my Dr decided to put me on Seroquel XR mg along with my other medicines In the beginning it seemed to help me as time went on my symptoms of low mood suicidal thoughts etc came backmost important to note was the WEIGHT GAIN In under a year almost lbs for no real reason Extreme fatigue and sleepinesshard to get out of bed in the mornings Am now reducing dosage to slowly get off it as per Drs orders and switching to an alternative I am hoping this will work
4040,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,41588,29,I took regular Seroquel which did help somewhat I would rate that at a out I found about Seroquel XR when people told me to see a pdoc this was in because I was bipolar and couldnt get it under control on my first visit with pdoc I told her my situation and Seroquel after my visit she gave me samples of Seroquel XR which was only out months at that time it has been a huge help with mania and depression I take mgs at bedtime when I wake up I take mg Lamictal that helps a great deal for me with the racing thoughts and impulsivity along with mg of clonazepam that has been a life saver it took many years in and out the psyc hospitals to finally get it right
4041,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,9,41552,34,From the age of eleven to seventeen I lost touch to reality no doctor could figure out what was wrong with me cause I didnt tell my real problems I was living in an imaginary world At the age of seventeen I was finally able to express some of my problems and got started on Seroquel XR day by day I had the feeling of becoming normal again and regained the control over my own life I still have issues from all the problems that involved my past but I can truly say that I got control back I truly think Seroquel XR saved my life
4043,Seroquel XR,Schizoaffective Disorde,9,41504,21,I take this medication for its side effects primarily It works great if you have severe insomnia This medicine makes you very hungry when you take it It also helps to relive anxious feelings and help calm feelings of stress Again my doctor prescribed this medicine due to weight loss insomnia anxiety This is not what the medicine is exactly made for but I have tried dozens of medicines and this is the only one that has helped with my problems
4045,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,41431,97,I have had depression since I was a child but I didnt start getting help for it until I was I have tried Prozac and Celexa which did nothing for me and then my doctor asked me if I have ever heard of a medicine called Seroquel XR I started out on mg and then worked my way up to mg The only side effects for me were weight gain and drowsiness but the drowsiness went away after a couple of months of using this medicine Overall I really like this medicine It has helped me tremendously
4046,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,41424,116,After taking Seroquel for months at mg I recently upped it to mg at nighttime This has resulted in me being able to drop my Ativian from mg to mg and still get a great sleep I am much more productive think clearly and feel positive I feel like my personality is coming back Coincidence I think not
4047,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,7,41403,32,I take this medication for Bipolar II and it has been amazing at stabilizing my moods I no longer feel filled with rage and irritability and no longer have issues with impulsive thoughts The big problem that I am having with this medication is horrendous weight gain I exercise at least three times a week and eat well yet I have gained kg pounds in the months that I have been on this medicine Another issue I have is vivid dreams But I think this is just a sign of getting deep and sound sleep something I could never achieve prior to taking this medicineIt is amazing but a nightmare all rolled into one
4048,Seroquel XR,Depression,7,41394,47,I was put on mg of Seroquel at age due to major depression I agree with the previous comment made even on such a low dose I also feel Im in a chemical straight jacket I have trouble thinking straight I cant concentrate for over minutes my sleep is average its extremely hard to wake up I also find Im so much more angrier and impulsive I stutter and cant form words as well as shaking uncontrollably in my legs when I get anxious I also get headaches or even at least twice per week However my family and close friends have noticed a considerable improvement in my mental health eg suicidal thoughts have almost stopped completely and an increase in more happy Emma daysSuch a strong powerful and dangerous med
4049,Seroquel XR,Depression,7,41387,58,I have been on a few antidepressants for years with only fair results My Doctor started me on some Seroquel XR mg at bedtime over the last few weeks This medication not only has helped me with the terrible side effects when you come off many of the typical SSRI but I am sleeping and my depression has improved from a out of to out of ten Sometimes SSRI medication side effects are stated as minor but they can be very severe at times More Doctors should know about Seroquel XR and the great results when stopping antidepressants
4050,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,41341,42,I was diagnosed with bipolar II about yrs ago and Ive tried everything on the market nothing worked for me except Seroquel Right now I take mg twice per day and Im so stable Im loving it problem though with Seroquel is that its a major weight gainer I would stop taking it on and off when I felt better but then would use other meds to bandage my symptomsget back on then off againuntil one day I decided to stop with the denial and allow someone to help me for real Ive been on it now faithfully for monthsbut Ive put on lbs It makes me eat after hours in the middle of the night Im depressed because of the weight gain So I workout at home at times trying to be more consistent You have to work this medicine
4051,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,2,41293,20,I was one of the unlucky ones whos prolactin levels skyrocketed I was only on mg with a plan to ramp my way up to over the course of weeks which was obviously vetoed when my chest started swelling quite noticeably Lactation isnt worth whats essentially only a sleeping pill at ltmg doses

4056,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,1,41201,22,I have had a negative experience on Seroquel I do not want this to deter anyone from taking it as everyones reaction and experience on this medicine is subjective I just want to put this out there for anyone who might be experiencing similar symptoms and reactions and may be hesitant to say it and to just relate my own experienceI am Bipolar and have untreated ADHD due to the ADHD medicines causing manic episodes I started Seroquel months ago when I was having a bout of insomnia I should state that I was on Wellbutrin Lamictal and Paxil and was feeling good I was productive during the day and upbeat I was prescribed Seroquel for the insomnia and taken off all the other except Lamictal I am now a quotzombiequot depressed sleepy

4059,Seroquel XR,Paranoid Disorde,9,41099,25,Seroquel XR worked for me better than the Seroquel From my understanding the XR is an extended release vs the regular Seroquel My paranoid thoughts have completely gone away except for the normal paranoia that everyone has of people sometimes talking about them It also gives me a lot of energy during the day and I do not have to take naps I have tried Abilify and other medicines but none seem to work as well as the Seroquel XR
4060,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,6,41086,36,My Dr gave me a sample of this medicine to try and it works good however it takes me a while to fall asleep and it gave me a hangover effect the next day Liked the sleep it gave me but I had a hard time waking up the next day
4061,Seroquel XR,Post Traumatic Stress Disorde,10,41057,45,Within three days basically all my anxiety is gone and I feel fantastic FINALLY a doctor and psychologist worked together to treat what they said quotuniquequot problem I had anxiety all the time but wasnt depressed So Im one happy lady and Im sure my kids are loving there old mum back
4062,Seroquel XR,Post Traumatic Stress Disorde,8,41055,38,A little tired some mornings which can occasionally last during the day As a medicine it is amazing makes me strong mentally and relaxed
4063,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,41010,41,Was taken off Geodon because of nighttime anxiety and put on Seroquel XR I feel so unmotivated Sedated I no more feel better by afternoon when its time to take it again I dread the next dose Havent felt this depressed in a while
4065,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,6,40977,26,Seroquel was the only thing that knocked me out Ive been on it for months but have gained lbs which I have attributed to Seroquel Not to mention that diet and exercise arent cutting it to lose the weight Wish I could find something that could make me sleep as well as Seroquel without the weight gain
4066,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,10,40955,29,Put me to sleep for over yrs the best sleep I ever got I just cant take it anymore because it raises my blood sugar
4067,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,40941,123,Ive had depression since I was a young teenager I didnt decide to get treatment until I was I felt like I was unraveling I didnt want to get out of bed I lost interest in all the things that I once loved to do I had problems with drugs and alcohol Sleeping problems The whole nine yardsThe medication that my doctor decided to put me on was Seroquel XR I was a little apprehensive at first being a drug user for many years I knew what Seroquel was My doctor assured me that in a controlled and carefully watched environment she believed it would help She started me on mgs Ive moved to mgs Ive had drastic positive changes in my mood I feel happy rested and content No negative side effects It worked miracles
4068,Seroquel XR,Depression,8,40926,64,Ive had depression for years and have been on Paxil about The Paxil worked for a few years but the anxiety and depression slowly worked its way back into my life So along with the Paxil they added other drugs Effexor Wellbutrin but they made me even more anxious I was finally put on regular Seroquel and found it worked for a little while but I was so tired all the time I couldnt function the next day I was literally fired from jobs from being stuck in bed and refusing to get up I was switched to Seroquel XR mg last year combined with the mgs of Paxil Im still on and Ive found a drastic improvement in my mood anger and anxiety My only complaint would be how sleepy it makes me in the mornings A large coffee or a caffeinated beverage does the trick though and its worth the sleepiness to have some peace of mind
4069,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,1,40926,62,SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN and METABOLIC SYNDROME I had always suffered from anxiety from childhood to adulthood My doctor prescribed a low dosage of MG in December At the time I was prescribed Seroquel XR MG I weighed lbs petite frame size or On January I weighed in at lbs The lbs of weight gain within one year went to my abdomen and I am covered in cellulite on my abs hips back buttocks and thighs I monitored my diet and intake the entire time but the weight gain was out of control
4070,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,9,40916,29,I loved how the XR worked for me I was on mg at night Was a day trial to see if it would help me it did My GP gave me the XR then my psychiatrist switched me to the IR mg so I could take either or pills depending how I felt That seemed to be working okay but I had another anxiety attack and it has been days since and I am still not recovered Tonight I am going to take the XR and see what tomorrow brings Luckily I do go to my Dr as well I am sure that I will feel better tomorrow as I felt great the day after my first XR dose
4071,Seroquel XR,Depression,5,40854,37,The first night I took this medication I almost ran out of breath before climbing the stairs from the basement to my room its as if my respiratory system was somewhat repressed It also caused some chestheart pain On the other hand I slept well for those two nights The side effects may be more dangerous than ones condition Please be careful
4073,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,40804,28,Seroquel XR is very good It boost up my energy After trying other medications this is the best with little side effects In the morning you feel like staying in bed and weight gain because of hunger craving
4074,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,3,40796,20,Made me too quothungoverquot and groggy the next day I was even breaking my mg pill in half
4075,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40780,26,I used to be so paranoid I couldnt even sleep at night I would go into manic episodes and be in lala land for days until this wonderful pill came into my life I have never felt better I just never felt so good Im happy
4077,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,40689,122,Seroquel XR has changed my life I feel I am present again in my world Before taking this medication I had very little hope that I would ever feel enthusiastic about life I recognize myself again I cant say enough about how excited I am about living I tried so many therapies and had given up hope anything would work The combination of my antidepressant and Seroquel XR was the key for me
4078,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40625,32,I suffer from bipolar OCD very severe anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder I had been in a mental hospital and had taken so many medicines I could never stop thinking to the point where I stayed awake all night Mood swings temper just raving mad waiting to be set off Some medicines worked for a short time and others just didnt work So my psychologist put me on Lamictal but it works very slowly and you have to start it on a low dose and work your way up I had taken it before but my other doctor left and every other doctor wanted to put me on Lithium but I said no because I have Lupus But when he put me on Seroquel XR well thats when things began to look a little bit brighter It does make you sleepy but its a great medicine at least for me anyway Hope this helps
4080,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40577,23,I had a quotnervous breakdownquot in November of and ended up in a psych hospital where I was promptly given Seroquel among other medicines The Seroquel was amazing I felt like someone switched the on button in my brain and I finally woke up When I got out of the hospital and sought out a new psychiatrist for treatment he took me off of the Seroquel because I am diabetic After a year of unsuccessful treatment with other medicines I begged to be put back on the Seroquel because the depression was unbearable and I wasnt responding to other medicines So he agreed and once again that switch has been flipped on and I feel quotnormalquot I am only on mg I have to take it early because it knocks me out In the morning I am very dizzy and have slurred speech
4082,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40524,58,All I can say it that it is a miracle medicine I finally have my life back There are side effects but it is worth it I am in college and doing well My doctors said that would never happen for me They said that I would be in and out of the psych ward I have not need to be in hospital in over five years I can finally hold a job Like I said I have my life back something I was told would never happen Seroquel XR is that reason for that Regular Seroquel is great too it just made me sleep for hours a day Seroquel XR makes me sleepy but I no longer over sleep Again I say I got my life back
4084,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,10,40470,101,I was on Seroqyel for two years and loved it except at the beginning was very sleepy but went away after a few weeks Very shaky but rather than that was wonderful I am drug free and loving it today though easy to go off it too
4085,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40448,25,After much trial an error with other medications I am pleased to find that Seroquel XR really helps I take mg per day Started at but worked my way up until I felt betterWish I had discovered this years ago
4086,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,1,40446,19,I only took this evening it put me to sleep This was one of the strongest medicines Ive taken I was put on mg I felt horrible the next day couldnt concentrate to read felt more depressed had to go back to bed in the morning and felt horrible the whole day Luckily my Doctor said I could quit it
4087,Seroquel XR,Depression,1,40408,25,Was put on this medication for mood stabilization as well as for sleep At the lowest dose it made me excessively drowsy the next day As for the mood stabilization all it did there was make me have violent outbursts while on the medication
4088,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40366,12,I have been taking Seroguel XR for less then a year It seems to work better for me I take mg in the morning then mg at night This helps me very much
4091,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,6,40315,26,Excellent for sleep onset up to a point If things get really bad Ive had to augment it with temazepam and Valium I also have depression I was on and off it for about months and it causes brain fog and word retrieval problems There is also a significant increase in appetite but its not as bad as Remeron
4092,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40301,61,At I simply couldnt take the depression the mania the ADD or the severe anxiety attacks anymore I finally went to the doctor and she put me on Seroquel XR starting at mg for days then mg for days and now the maintenance dosage of mgs It has honestly changed my life and saved my marriage My brain seems to function normally now My nearly constant suicide thoughts are gone and I can concentrate on tasks for more than seconds at a time I would rather have a healthy appetite than feeling nauseous so that side effect only boosts my moods The only thing I dont like is my dreams are VIVID but not in a nightmare sort of way Ive begun dreaming in color which is also new I can certainly live with that
4093,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40294,53,I was diagnosed Bipolar with psychotic features years ago but always dealt with grandiose thinking mild delusions a good deal of depression After self medicating for two years I had a mental melt down and after spending months cooped up in my apartment anorexic dying I decided it was time to see a psychiatrist The medications I was prescribed ranged from mood stabilizers to antipsychotics benzos sleeping pills many I was allergic to like Depakote and Trileptal Anyway at first I tried the regular Seroquel but gained lbs in one month and slept hours a day Switched to Seroquel XR not as tired lost bs appetite mental noise decreased panic relief strong sleep aide life manageable they are expensive HIGHLY recommend
4095,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,40259,47,It helps Will make you feel better about yourself
4096,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40246,35,Seroquel XR has been a blessing for me I currently take mg at night I have suffered from terrible insomnia but with this medicine I actually get some sleep at night As far as anxiety goes it works wonders for me It totally wiped out my anxiety and I was able to get off of Lithium In my opinion it works wonderful for mania but I wish it helped a little more with my depression I take mg of Prozac to boost that I did gain some weight but the benefits outweigh this problem Overall I think it is a wonderful medicine I would recommend it highly
4098,Seroquel XR,Depression,5,40199,30,The drug is good at making one feel good but the weight gain is bad
4100,Seroquel XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,9,40148,100,Causes a little tiredness but completely eliminates anxiety and provides an excellent nights sleep mg at night
4101,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,9,40131,60,I completely support the first review I have had insomnia for many years and tried everything from herbs to drugs And only this could help and provide a good rest during the night I have already taken this medication for over years about mg not more It is enough to get hours with no dreams sleep
4103,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,40114,16,Ive only been on Seroquel XR for days so its hard to tell long term side effects It definitely makes me calmer and allows me to handle difficult or stressful situations more appropriately not crying at the drop of a hat or feeling extreme anxiety I am only on mg at bedtime but Im not completely so hoping to increase that dose a bit when I see my doc next I do get headaches and have lost my appetite still havent lost any weight though I am hoping for the best
4105,Seroquel XR,Depression,9,40103,41,It seems to be very helpful for my depression anxiety adult ADD and overall mood Seroquel XR also seems to have no noticeable side effects and I sleep great Ive been taking of the mg in the evening now for months
4106,Seroquel XR,Insomnia,9,40079,102,I have suffered insomnia for many years and have tried numerous drugs on this list Most of which failed to provide any relief After just one dose of Seroquel XR I slept a full hours and even took a nap during the day My mood has changed and I feel so much healthier now that I am able to get good sound NORMAL sleep Two thumbs up for Seroquel XR I highly recommend you discuss this drug with your physician if you are having CHRONIC trouble sleeping NOT casual sleeping problems It has changed my life I hope this helps some other insomniacs out there who have been suffering for years the way I had been BEST OF LUCK to all of you
4107,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40070,13,Love this medication I take it with two other mood stabilizers an antidepressant and another when required antipsychotic This works wonders I do not get tired on it and I typically take mg I have gone up to mg before when needed Definitely chills me out I do not get akathisia on this one like I do all the other antipsychotics Overall just wonderful If you have had issues with akathisia before on other medicines this would be the one to try
4108,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,40054,71,I have heard all kinds of bad things about Seroquel but to me this medicine has saved my life I was diagnosed with cyclothymia with racing thoughts and extreme hypomanic phases followed by intense depression Not to mention I would get so paranoid sometimes that I couldnt leave the house I had tried everything including lithium but then I went to a new doctor She said I could try Seroquel XR but I probably wouldnt like feeling sedated I said sedated fine The funny thing is that I have had more energy but it is calm positive energy I made a huge turn around and life is back on track I thought I had ADHD as well but now I have great concentration no anxiety and can sit still for hours I highly recommend if your symptoms sound like mine
4109,Seroquel XR,Schizophrenia,10,40039,23,Works well sedating though
4110,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,40035,18,I have been on Seroquel XR for about month I am happier and sleep better
4111,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,9,40033,27,Great medication for agitation and sleep when taken in the evening There is a bit of a hangover period for a couple of hours but that is acceptable to me for a full nights sleep Much better than regular Seroquel which you better be near a bed soon after taking it Seroquel XR is much smoother and gives me a chance to adjust to the sedation as I get ready for bed
4112,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,10,39993,27,I think this is one of the best medications out there at this time It has really changed me I have bipolar and I cant tell you how happy I am I have also been on regular Seroquel and there is no comparison XR for me works far better than the regular
4113,Seroquel XR,Post Traumatic Stress Disorde,10,39991,47,This medication is very effective in relieving post traumatic stress disorder but has side effects like high blood sugar high blood pressure high cholesterol lack of bladder control
4114,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,39973,19,Seroquel did not work for me I went up to mg and felt like a zombie Now Ive taken Seroquel XR for years Ive seen my anxiety level go to normal But it is necessary for me to plan the time I take the medication to avoid slurred speech in the morning it needs to be in my system at least hours it seems Constipation is severe enough to take laxatives everyday My husband has to keep reminding me the positives outweigh the side effects by far Then I stop and think and know that is true
4116,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,8,39933,17,I just started taking Seroquel XR a week ago after a bad experience with Geodon So far so good I feel more quotlaid backquot on Seroquel and it helps me sleep which is good for me because I have bad insomnia Im only taking mg now but notice no ill effects Time will tell if I need to take more
4117,Seroquel XR,Depression,6,39913,50,I was put on this medicine very aggressively mg quickly upped to mg after a suicide attempt As an antidepressant it is more effective than the first line medications like citalopram And will help with sleep and a lack of hunger However I absolutely hate the side effectsIt is often said that antipsychotics quotsteal your soulquot or act like a quotmental prisonquot I would have to agree To begin with this was fine with severe depression I was happy to take any way out However after about months of this I decided enough was enoughNow Im off it my personality is back
4118,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,4,39883,23,Worked for mood stabilization but side effects were not acceptable There were vivid and sometimes nightmares also weight gain
4119,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,3,39868,13,I found that it made me very tired and was not very useful
4120,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,5,39851,40,This medicine will make you fat and happy
4121,Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,7,39816,30,I like this medicine Even the side effects are manageable I get loopy on them but that is better than the screaming drama queen I once was I take mg and have a psychiatrist and a councellor who that helps me through situations that I used to rage through Also Im a rapidcycling BiPolar II so I think its wonderful just to be able to be somewhat normal
4123,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,39678,94,For years I suffered from severe depression doctors must have tried every different medicine of this nature in hopes to help me however it wasnt until I was given seroquel that I began to feel better and sleep like a baby At first I would sleep to hours after taking the medicine then I began to get used to it I havent had a bout of depression in years I can sleep again but now around hours a night I can honestly say I love this pill Even with the side effects of hunger its totally worth it
4124,Seroquel XR,Depression,10,39657,113,Everyday I was very depressed or very angery for no apparant reason It felt like my brain was all tangled and it was really hurting me and had been for years So I talked with my doctor and she put me on mg seroquel Since then I can think clearly and feel happy I love it You start at mg and work up to higher doses Watch out though if you try to start at mg it can knock you out for hrs or at least it knocked me out
4125,Nafarelin,Endometriosis,7,40147,4,Synarel worked well for preventing endometriosis but some of the side effects appear to be irreversible Since taking this drug over years ago I gained pounds while on the prescription which I have been unable to lose and also developed a bad case of rosacea during that time Definitely check out the possible side effects before taking any medication
4126,Nafarelin,Endometriosis,10,39521,7,Synarel has been a god send for me in many ways It helped with pain and had much fewer side effects than depo lupron I felt like myself again while taking the synarel and it helped suppress the endo for over years
4129,Junel Fe 24,Birth Control,10,42877,2,I had been on Loestrin which switched to LomediaFE on for about years and after finding out that the manufacturer was backordered until April I threw in the towel and stopped calling pharmacies within a mile radius of me haha My doctor wrote my new RX for Microgestin and Junel was what showed up at Walgreens I take it at night before bed and for all I know Im still takin Lomedia I havent experienced any side effects which I am so grateful for
4130,Junel Fe 24,Birth Control,8,42864,0,Im reading all these terrible reviews and I feel like my experience is almost exactly opposite Its not perfect but Im pretty happy with the birth control I do struggle with anxiety and depression but if anything Ive noticed a quotlevelling outquot over the past month of taking Junel Im on the iron pills this week though and Ive noticed my appetite go through the roof I was really confused until I went to take the pill this morning and it all made sense My skin has improved a little which Im a little impressed with in only a months time Ive suffered from cystic acne for years I did spot a little in week and then again for a day in week but my period is much lighter than normal and Ive heard that it regulates in a few months time
4131,Junel Fe 24,Birth Control,5,42796,0,Only been on this about a month but Im not pregnant so thats good But in the beginning I did have diarrhea and abdominal pain I had very light spotting barely anything at all I do believe this has made me gain some weight tho which I do not like but other than that I feel fine mentally
4132,Nilstat,Oral Thrush,8,42023,28,The Nilstat cleared up the white spots in my mouth within days and my throat was less sore so that I could start eating solid food for the first time since radiation treatment weeks On the third bottle but have not fully cleared all the thrush from my throat I have had Chemo radiation and heaps of antibiotics so I am a hard case for it
4133,Nilstat,Oral Thrush,10,41797,28,My daughter has to use this for thrush that her other medications cause It helps a lot
4134,Norvir,HIV Infection,1,42779,0,I was prescribed Norvir along with Truvada and Prezista as a substitute for Atripla My physician felt that it would increase my CD count which had stabilized for some time at the range I began the regimen with Norvir and the other antivirals in September and checked the progress in December months The CD count had declined to and the new treatment was clearly not effective He had me retested at the end of January and the count had fallen to I have since gone back to AtriplaNorvir has a serious contraindication when combined with a steroid I have been using Advair for COPD and the Norvir reacted with the fluoxetine in Advair and caused my face to become puffy weight gain and stomach issues
4135,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40428,58,I recently underwent radiation therapy for uterine cancer It made my IBS predominately diarrhea x worse It was so bad I couldnt eat anything without making me feel sicker My oncologist suggest Imodium which didnt work until she added Lomotil to the Imodium Together it works and I can do activities without worrying about another episode
4136,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40385,2,Ive been taking this medicine for colitis for years and now I can take my daughters out by myself Im not running to the bathroom or having accidents its wonderful I do have constipation So anyone with colitis should try it I take pills in the morning then every hours everyday and Im loving life finally
4137,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,7,40375,19,I had my colon removed due to Ulcerative Colitis and have been running to the bathroom regularly I was taking Lomotil a day and still going times a day
4139,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,2,40300,25,I am taking Lomotil because I had surgery Then bone infection set in and I had to take IV antibiotics which caused extensive diarrhea The first day I took Lomotil it worked great for about hours but the following days decreased in its effectiveness By the third day it was no longer working for me but I attribute this to the antibiotics I will have to let my doctor know so that he can possibly prescribe another antidiarrhea medicine or change my antibiotic
4140,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,8,40163,30,I was in hospital for Severe Ulcerative Colitis I was so bad I was going to times a day Right now I have no insurance but can afford Lomotil and it has me slowed down to to times a day which I love and can more than live with It does say it can blur your vision but so can diabetes and I take so much predisone it makes my sugar stay high all day too
4141,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40133,67,I have many things wrong with me one of them being IBS I was having such a hard time carrying out my daily routines because I would be in the bathroom most of the time My stomach hurt real bad too It was so bad I had to go to the Urgent Health Care then the hospital They could not find anything abnormal in my blood work or my CAT scan so the doctor prescribed these Within days I was feeling great Now I am on them all the time because that is how severe my condition is but it makes life a lot easier It takes away the stomach cramping and I only have a bowel movement like times a day compared to
4144,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,3,40056,15,It made me constipated for days
4148,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,39819,53,I started to take Lonox once I was diagnosed with IBS Before I started the pill I was always in the bathroom Everything I ate made me sick I was afraid to leave my house eat out and just go out in general When I would get my ldquoattacksrdquo I felt as if I had no control over my body If I had to go I HAD TO GO There was no such thing as waiting until I got home I started to map out public bathrooms that I felt comfortable enough in just in cause I had an emergency on the road and had to go Irsquove felt as if Lonox has given me my life back Irsquom able to go out on long trips eat out and be me again with out fearing an ldquoemergencyrdquo I was directed to take pills times a day but it made me constipated and I would cramp pretty bad What works for me is taking the pills once a day in the morning I always go to the bathroom within frac hr of taking the pill but at least itrsquos predictable now and I stay regulated Some days I have to take the pill twice but never more than that
4149,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,39729,26,It worked within a few days
4150,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,39705,21,Works really fast
4151,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,39698,61,Really works fast and without any side effects Seems to clear up persistant and ongoing diarrhea overnight Taking the tiny tablets is much better than dealing with liquids
4152,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42821,27,I have a long history of IBSD which has grown worse in the past few years after undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer The diarrhea has become severe and daily and without lomotil I could rarely leave my house It has helped tremendously and I dont seem to have any significant side effects I try to take no more than one pill a day in the morning and it usually keeps me diarrheafree until late afternoon depending on what I eat for lunch Some days it holds me all day I am very grateful for this drug because nothing else Ive tried has worked at all
4153,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,1,42773,2,I have had severe diahrrea for months every morning bowel movements and this was of no help up dose to twice no change now going for more medical testings
4154,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,8,42745,15,I have been taking Lomotil since I had surgery to repair a fistula in my intestines I have crohns and am yr old male The Lomotil has made it somewhat bearable and I have not had as many bouts of liquid feces since taking Not a miracle drug but does help in a tremendous way I suggest that you try it if you have disease that I have Cannot stress NOT MIRACLE DRUG BUT DOES HELP TREMENDOUSLY
4155,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,1,42689,9,If youre sensitive to any medication I dont recommend taking I had an adverse reaction and it caused me to end up in the ER I started out taking one dose and then began feeling anxious after several hours Against my better judgement I took a second dose and the next morning felt nauseous which then led to vomiting that wouldnt stop and severe anxiety It also caused my heart rate to increase I had to be treated for dehydration and nausea as well as something to calm my heart rate An FYI I found out the hard way that Imodium AD also has similar effects on my body I guess Ill try and go a more natural route
4156,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42684,1,I am taking chemo Dr prescribed it Usually diarrhea next week Tue amp Wed Had that but also Thu morn it was terrible for amphr Took med in middle of all amp it got better Only pill as prescribed So glad it stopped it No side effects
4157,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42410,46,Ive had ulcerative colitis since with severe abdominal cramping and spasms with and without diarrhea After numerous attempts with other medications I found lomotil to be most effective at controlling symptoms without the side effects of other medications such as flushing I can take lomotil tabs at the onset of abdominal symptoms and abort attacks of diarrhea It also works for cramping caused by spasms of the intestinal wall preventing feces from being expelled Doctors are amazed that Ive lived with this disease for so long without surgery steroids or sulfa drugs My key is managing my stress level which is very helpful overall and lomotil which aborts diarrhea and alleviates cramping A miracle drug for me
4158,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42408,36,I have taken Lomotil for years in the am amp in the pm which controls my diarrhea except I am good for sixeight weeks and then for whatever reason it doesnt work for a week or so I even up my dosage but it doesnt help thankfully the Lomotil starts working again Just wish I didnt have the time it doesnt work
4159,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42332,15,I had diarrhea several times a week and especially when we went out I felt housebound After beginning dosages of Lonox I was more comfortable able to travel and able eat out Because of these improvements in my health I also am more secure in leaving my house
4160,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42315,9,Nothing worked but this drug
4161,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,9,42270,44,Most effective antidiarrhea med Ive ever takenafter years of explosive chronic diarrhea
4162,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42225,61,Other than Tincture of Opium Lomotil is the best thing for controlling diarrhea Because the Opium is so expensive I often can take only lomotil and it works at the maximum dosage and more to slow down my diarrhea Without it I would have nothing to live for literally It is a lifesaver
4163,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,42124,79,Ive had IBS for years but when I had colon surgery years ago I started to really have problems with chronic severe diarrhea to xs a day I was miserable leaking wearing Depends just depressed about no solution Finally I found a doctor who prescribed Lomotil tabs xs a day and it worked And without any side effects Im now down to or doses a day and feeling so much better
4165,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,8,41965,6,Had a bout of what I was beginning to think was food poisoning Long story short I landed in the ER This was prescribed for me along with antibiotics I have taken exactly one pill one a little over hours ago Have gone from extreme diarrhea every minutes to not being able to go at all From one dose Does this stuff work as advertised Unequivocally Yes I am a bit nervous at this point as to whether I will ever be able to go again I have to admit yes
4167,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,41431,13,I have had severe diarrhea since I was years old After countless other trials on different medications with no success I was finally put on Lomotil It has changed my life I no longer have to go or times a day or constantly arrange my schedule around my problem I have been on it for years now and unfortunately was misinformed by a former GI doctor that it was no different than Imodium or I would have tried it earlier Very effective
4168,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,41394,137,This medication has been a God send Before I knew about this medication I was in and out of the bathroom at least times in one day and it was every time I put food in my mouth That went on for a full year I couldnt go anywhere without going to the bathroom first and if I was out and about I couldnt eat anything until I got home Me and my wife couldnt even go out to eat on our anniversary because of my problem It was taking over my life and I was getting depressed but then my doctor gave me Lomotil and it works like a charm Instead of going to the bathroom after each time I put food in my mouth I now only go about times a day and I can now eat at restaurants now Ihis medication put reassurance back in my life again
4169,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,3,41094,25,Lomotil made me extremely drowsy and nauseous I thought it was my stomach infection it only happened every hours and after I took the pill
4171,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40915,96,I was having to go plus times a day and started to lose weight because every time I ate I had to run to the bathroom So now with the Lomotil I go maybe three times a day and I only have to take of these a day which is nice in the morning after the first trip to the bathroom and after each extra trip which only ends up to be two more times at the most This is the one medicine I dont want to live without
4172,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40813,119,Lomotil has been a complete blessing for me Imodium did not touch my severe diarrhea I suffer from depression anxiety panic attacks and agoraphobia With these symptoms caused severe stomach problems When given Lomotil for a possible chance it might help I am now living without being in the bathroom every hour I found no side effects I cannot even tell you the difference it has made When I do have to leave home I have no worries about finding where the bathroom is before I even proceed to do what I have to do YES This is one miracle in my life that brings some normality to scratch off my list of problems I can even eat out at restaurants now
4174,Atropine / diphenoxylate,Diarrhea,10,40667,11,I am a veteran I suffer from PTSD severe anxiety disorder agoraphobia deathly fear of leaving my home and within the last years IBS My diarrhea was truly horrid IBS topped with severe anxiety is unfathomable I went through every test possible including CT Scans and multiple colonoscopies just looking for some reason any reason for the constant times spent literally in a panicked run to the bathroom They didnt reveal a thing except that you are not immune to having an episode just because you are in a CT machine very embarrassing I changed my medicines around and wound up with the opportunity to try Atropine without nasty interactions It has not completely cured me but it is by far the best Ive tried and I have been on many medicines
4177,Temsirolimus,Renal Cell Carcinoma,9,42384,2,Ive been taking med for two years Dont have any side effects and the cancer isnt increasing Dont take antinausea med or benedril any more
4179,Goodys Headache Powders,Migraine,10,42668,0,Ive taken Goodys Powers and BC Powers off and on for decades It really does work Its bad for the stomach but most all these medicinesdrugsprescriptions are bad for the stomach It works quickly amp affectivelyWithin minutes or less you will feel the pain subside I prefer it over the bottles of headache meds It would be nice it it came in the form of tablets capsules even gels If wanting to try just put the power on the back of your tongue and swallow with a glass of sweet tea or juice It makes it bearable for those that dont like the taste or cant stand it I usually drink water but Im accustomed to it That reminds me theres Standback Powers also Try not to take more than is actually needed less is better

4184,Codeine,Pain,10,40146,11,I was prescribed codeine when my wisdom teeth were taken out This should only be used for extreme and chronic pain It made me feel completely out of it I was dizzy and felt like I had a brick on my chest the entire time while I was using it
4185,Codeine,Pain,1,40144,19,My dentist prescribed it to me to treat a toothache and its completely useless
4188,Codeine,Cough,10,39983,17,I could barely breath or eat when I had bronchitis When I took codeine I could at least drink water and eat noodles I dont know how I would have survived without it Although I had to quit taking it before I finished my prescription because it made me feel quotdrunkquot if I dont have major pain
4189,Codeine,Pain,10,39841,59,Very effective I have osteoarthritis and can be pain free with Codeine It is more effective with Ibuprofen ALSOprofoundly lifts depression due to chronic pain and makes such a better life day to day Space doses well apart to avoid tolerance I use only in the morning with very good effect Using whole daily dose in the morning may get you through the day without a need for a second dose I would leave at least hours between doses to assure full effectDont suffer needlessly Good luck and hope this helps
4190,Codeine,Diarrhea,10,39784,40,I have severe IBS Irritable Bowel Syndrome and could not find relief until I was prescribed codeine for it At this point most of my symptoms are either completely gone or nearly goneI can say that codeine is a wonder drug when it comes to resolving the symptoms
4192,Codeine,Pain,5,39657,32,I take this drug for my back pain with other pain killers and I find this drug very good
4193,Codeine,Pain,9,39651,27,I was in hospital for some time with chest pains and when I was given codeine phosphate it took the pain straight away I also suffer from back pain and codeine phosphate really works I would recommend it

4197,Acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide,Migraine,10,40771,4,I cannot say enough good things about this medication I have suffered from migraines for years I have taken every over the counter medicine there is to take for migraine pain and beyond I have also taken prescription medicines that really wipe me out I got a migraine at work one day and went to our first aid kit to see if they had anything I could take I found some pain aid and took it and could not believe how fast it worked It took my migraine away within minutes I have referred others to this medication and they have had the same reaction I cant buy this at in stores in our area but the person who stocks our first aid kit said he can sell it to me Yay
4198,Acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide,Migraine,10,40180,7,I buy PainAids brand at local QuikTrip thats about the only place I know to buy painaids A box of packages with painaids in each package is They are the best for relieving headaches and other pains They do not upset my stomach even on an empty one I have tried many pain killers even prescription and these are by far the best Easy to purchase if there is a Quik Trip nearby because I have not found them in Walmart Kmart or any other drug store Once I found them at a health food store in Akron Ohio which was great because I couldnt find a QuikTrip It has all ingredients aspirin acetaminophen caffeine salicylamide I give the highest rating
4199,Acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide,Pain,5,40050,4,I work at a doctors office and was given a sample of this for a migraine Im supposed to be taking preventative medicine for migraines but dont like the side effects This did take a lot of the pain away decreasing it to I suppose youd say a moderate headache and I was able to get through my day But when it wore off the full migraine came right back The only downside is the pill got lodged in my throat and I nearly choked on it Its really large I can take a one a day vitamin every morning with no problems theyre fairly big So its not that I have trouble swallowing
4200,Blephamide,Conjunctivitis Bacterial,10,42510,1,This was a wonder drug for me I live outdoors a lot and I sweat a lot and so I get bacterial conjunctivitis about once every months If I apply just a couple drops when I feel my eyes first getting itchy this stuff makes it go away overnight A couple more in the morning and I am good to go for the next months If however the eyes get red before you realize you have the conjunctivitis then it might take multiple applications to make it go away but it will in a matter of a couple days Very good stuff High priced but not so much that its unaffordable
4202,Codeine,Diarrhea,9,43054,0,Suffered from Lower Anterior Resection Syndrome for years Especially needing to empty my bowels every to hours during the night Codeine was the only thing that stopped this and allowed me to have uninterrupted sleep Lomotil or Imodium did nothing
4203,Codeine,Pain,10,43049,0,I have been taking codeine yrs with diazepam amp Tylenol I can no longer take antiinflammatories too unfortunately I have a huge tolerance regularly taking mg a day tablets On pain free days I need to take a tablet about every hrs or withdrawal starts after about That is a bit like having a dose of flu for a few days combined with severe diarrhoea in my case During rare painfree periods it isnt worth weaning myself off completely cos the pain is never away longEveryone different mg gives me hrs max relief No constipation dizziness or nauseathe latter often experienced briefly on st use inc posters here dose probs too big Constipation is common amp worse than the pain Im told so go easy
4206,Codeine,Pain,1,42540,2,I had an external hemorrhoids surgery and codeine not helping me whatsoever as the doctor prescribed mg I take still same and has not helped me with tonsillitis surgery too
4207,Codeine,Cough,10,42461,6,more than a decade of a horrible chronic cough doc put me on codeine and whatever damage it might be doing to my body it has been well worth it I have had to increase dosage considerably but so far I have not become immune thank god because I dont want to live coughing like I have in the past No side effects that are negative
4208,Codeine,Diarrhea,9,42435,11,bowel resections due to crohns disease I now have short bowel syndrome with chronic diarrhea I have tried every antidiarrheral drug there is and the only one that has helped is codeine I consider it a wonder drug for my condition enabling me to lead a mostly normal life I have taken the same amount everyday for years I dont feel quothighquot but do feel slightly drowsy occasionally I did have a period of months where I stopped taking it and while I did have some physical symptoms not mental in stopping they were not too bad the symptom relief I had on the drug far outweighed the negatives I continue to take and it makes my life easier
4209,Codeine,Pain,9,42421,8,When I got my wisdom teeth pulled out by my dentist he prescribed me mg Codeine x daily along with Promethazine mg x daily He couldnt prescribe me Norco Percocet or any other Narcotic that contained NSAIDs ESP APAP Tylenol because I have liver problems It worked great At first the Codeine wasnt enough but when I got a script for Promethazine on top of the Codeine it worked WONDERS Killed all the pain I was real happy because I didnt need a dose raise from the Narcotic Codeine is an excellent pain medication for moderate pain
4210,Codeine,Pain,10,42396,5,Great It works well for pain but does not last as long as Id like I cant take hydrocondone which make me itch and sometimes break out in night sweats
4211,Codeine,Pain,9,42386,10,Fantastic would be suffering with out I take cocodamol for tooth ache that Im getting work on and having to wait a while for referral to go through But this really does make the pain vanish in about minutes Only down side is it can make you feel very drowsy and very slight stomach ache but I take to help me sleep as thats when the pain is at its worst and it does help you sleep Also causes constipation and the pain free moments only last a few hours
4212,Codeine,Pain,3,42363,4,Brought on a wicked toothache like Ive never had before
4214,Codeine,Pain,8,42282,7,I had of my wisdom teeth taken out this past August My dentist prescribed me codeine and ibuprofen Whenever I took the codeine my pain level was very low so Id say it worked pretty well The only reason I didnt give a ten is because it did make me extremely nauseous at one point
4215,Codeine,Pain,10,42244,16,lI was lucky to have had a Dr that did research with codeine for Narcolepsy Codeine has a paradoxil effect in Narcoleptics It works better than any stimulants to not only be able to stay awake but aware without the awful side effects of a stimulant such as jitteriness I Am able to read do paper work budget money drive things that require concentration that are otherwise extremely difficult and hard to do and get right Codeine has allowed me to be able to do things I wouldnt be able to do anymore on just stimulants Gives me some life back Having Narcolepsy is like having to watch life go by in a dream it steels your ability to participate in life Slowly built a tolerance otherwise no problems at all

4218,Codeine,Pain,10,41533,27,After morphine this would probably be the best pain reliever I know of I have never had any dizziness blurred vision or sleepiness but thats probably just me Fantastic for wisdom teeth also
4221,Codeine,Pain,9,41297,23,Excellent pain relief for ovarian cancer Only downside terrible constipation that no amount of drinking or eating prunes kiwi fruit or bran made any difference
4222,Codeine,Pain,10,41040,25,I tried paracetamol and ibuprofen but theyre not as effective as codeine Codeine is really helping me for muscle spasm I have as I am suffering from cerebral palsy Im glad I got it prescribed from my GP doctor
4223,Codeine,Pain,9,40904,20,I took codeine every hours when I had a broken arm Codeine worked well and took the pain away in about to minutes after taking it but the pain started coming back again after about hours

4255,Belviq,Weight Loss,6,42992,20,Ive been taking Belviq for over a year and have lost over lbs Im no longer taking my antidepressants either because I call it my little happy pill However they keep raising the price and I can no longer afford it Im sick of drug companies and they games they play with peoples lives
4262,Belviq,Obesity,10,42960,27,I began this medication a few days ago and its been a Godsend thus far My main problem in the past has been nocturnal eating Id wake up barrel down to the kitchen and whilst half asleep devour PBampJ pasta whatevertheheck was in the fridge Thats gone As a result Ive been sleeping through the night I dont often feel hungry and when I do I control my portions with ease No nausea or headaches yet I felt a bit quotstrangequot my first day on it but that may have been a result of not feeling hungry of the time I was also slightly lightheaded my second day may have been a result of reduced caloric intake Ive yoyoed a lot and finally feel that the monkey is slipping off my back RECOMMENDED
4263,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42959,15,I have lost pounds over the last years I used Belviq as one part of my process It definitely helped reduce my hunger and I didnt experience the side effects some people describe But it only worked for me if I stayed with my plan Weight Watchers for keeping track of weight loss weighing my self every day exercising about minutes every day What I have learned is that there is no quotdietingquot It is a life long process of accepting that I cannot live like I had been and finding great ways to enjoy food and movement not a life long deprivation a lifelong change for the better I wiill continue to take Belviq I gave it out of because it is a month and that is a significant amount for me
4264,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42958,12,I started my journey on Unfortunately I am very limited to my exercise routine due to a car accident I changed the way I eat and I try to eat healthier and smaller portions I so far am down lbs I am hoping I keep losing With the discount card its free no copay for me

4267,Belviq,Weight Loss,3,42952,9,I took this drug for approximately days I experienced headache nauseousiness diarrhea dizziness EXTREME fatigue insomnia Stopped taking it so wasted

4276,Belviq,Obesity,1,42931,4,Ive been taking BELVIQ for almost months without any weight loss I have been eating healthy meals and walking about a mile and more practically every day Why wont the weight start falling off Please help Tat
4277,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42927,33,This has been good for losing weight I was skeptical at first because of all of the reported side effects and the costs I checked with my pharmacy and found that my insurance paid all but for it and the manufacturer will send you a card to cover the rest There was ZERO cost for me to try this First the side effects I had them all Tired joint pains back pain feeling foggy It was bad Everything subsided within the first weeks The back pain still remains but not as bad Now results I started the drug on at pounds As of I am down to pounds I walk daily and dont feel like eating too much My cravings for sugar soda and fast food is all but gone My weight loss is slowing now though
4278,Belviq,Weight Loss,4,42924,12,I took it for a week The first days brought a headache amp then that resolved I was also a bit nauseous those days I did notice that I had almost no appetite right away so apparently it is effective for satiation I had to stop taking it though because of the following Cough started immediately amp resolved the day after I stopped taking itDizziness amp difficulty with balanceDeep sleep amp trouble getting going in the morning when the dizziness was worseSneezing amp sore throat Now this may sound like maybe I just had a cold but I didnt I am a nurse and I know the differenceSome difficulty with memory amp concentrationDry mouth but that is no big dealAnother deterrent for me is that I cant take my migraine med with it
4279,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42919,14,So not worth it I had all kinds of bad effects on the drug but I am here to warn you about stopping it My doctor told me to stop it cold turkey I figured since it was a selective SSRI I didnt have to taper I have spent the next six weeks with profound problems with my heart rhythm Which my doctor thinks is unrelated After weeks things seem to be calming a bit But not after all kinds of tests and a halter monitor and of course that looks like your crazy I know it was this drug The only time I ever had them before was after discontinuing Celexa without tapering when it was first introduced and they didnt know better I dont have palpitations normally There is no good information on this drug You are just winging it
4280,Belviq,Weight Loss,9,42916,21,Started May st have lost pounds as of today June th Changed eating habits not much exercise yet but is coming soon per month Used a coupon on line only took off dollars Does anyone know one that will work Insurance doesnt pay for mine Please help I want to continue on this journey but takes a chunk out of the budget
4281,Belviq,Obesity,7,42901,19,The drug works I needed to exercise Without exercise I experience headaches and weird dreams But when I get out and walk I feel much much better and the weight comes off faster to I went from lb down to lb and my enthusiasm for walking and finally hitting the gym increased I lost all the cravings and especially the feeling that Im hungry all the time That helped me get started Then eating very little each day and exercising is the key HOWEVER dont stop taking the drug cold turkey I did that and I turned lethargic and my hunger and cravings for fast food doughnuts ice cream and sugary drinks hit twice as hard and I gained back pounds Now I have to start all over
4283,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42900,36,I started taking Belviq May I am quot and start weight was lb Today makes day and I am at lb and thats the number with my period on sorry TMI so it will be lower once its gone off I know lbs in days sounds like nothing right But I havent exercised nor watched what I have been eating only because I wanted to see what the pill had to offer Not only did I lose weight but I lost inches How many inches Im not sure I just know that I can wear my rompers and tight shirts without my girdle
4286,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42896,44,I started this pill on Tuesday night My insurance paid for it after preauthorization from my Dr my co pay was but pharmacist referred me to website and coupon paid that so I thought what the hell Ill try it I am and on Monday I weighed On Thursday I weighed so full days on medication I lost lbs I started my diet one strict calorie diet and now I am so full I feel sick if I eat more than about but my husband makes me eat The only side effect I have had from it is insomnia so I take mg at am mg at pm No side effects now I absolutely love it
4290,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42886,43,I have been on Belviq for nearly months I take mg twice daily My BMI was in the Obese range I never had a single sideeffect Not one I have lost pounds The medication just took away my cravings I never even want dessert and have no desire for sweetsSadly I am not an exercise person so Ive done very little of that Some people might think that pounds indicates a slow weight loss in that length of time but I am thrilled By the way I just eat normal food but much smaller portions I just get full very quickly Im sorry some people have had problems or side effects For me it was a life saver I still have more to lose but Ill get there Then I have to figure out how to keep it off
4292,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42886,14,Belviq works great for an appetite suppressant I experienced a little dizziness and a couple first days I had slight chills could be coincidental But times I took it with AllegraD and had a horrible headache the kind where you think you might pukemigraine status I truly believe it was just the combination of the pseudoephedrine and the Belviq Ive never had a headache when I take it with Benadryl I have bad spring allergies
4293,Belviq,Obesity,8,42885,14,So I started Belviq a few weeks ago I sometimes had headaches but nothing a few advil wouldnt cure It took about weeks for the medicine to start working You have to be patient and remember this is a serotonin drug it affects the serotonin in your brain which controls hunger and feeling of fullness Its just like when you take medicine for depression anxiety OCD they take time to work I was very surprised I did not have any side effects to speak of because I am super sensitive to medication I am less hungry and I do not find myself thinking of food all the time I have lost pounds thus far and am hoping to continue losing weight
4294,Belviq,Obesity,3,42884,5,Ive been on Belviq for days and have felt nothing I havent felt the urge to eat less nor any side effects Anybody want to share and let me know when I would start to feel something Thanks
4296,Belviq,Obesity,10,42880,13,The first two days of being on Belviq were rough but after that I knew right away it was worth it My insurance does not cover it but with the coupon it is I did not get a refill thinking I would be fine without it but my weight loss has stalled and I am back to eating how I was before hand even tho Im trying not too My starting weight was and my current weight after one month of taking it is without exercise since I was healing from surgery I just refilled it and will start going to gym with my next paycheck
4297,Belviq,Weight Loss,3,42879,10,When I first started I had bad side effects Such as feeling like a head cold etc Anxiety Trouble seeing Headaches But they did wear off Then I was ok but for really bad cognitive problems Unable to remember things at work Some problems talking But as long as I was losing weight Finally I realized I was having loose stools due to this drug and came close to a couple of accidents That was it I stopped Yikes I had horrible withdrawal Heart Palpitations nausea I am weening off When I got off the drug I dont think I ate anymore but I gained lbs the week after cutting back the dose I found a similar thing when I started for the first two weeks I didnt lose any weight but then lost fast Something is up with that
4298,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,43049,1,dont use this product it burns and continues to burn for days
4299,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,43015,0,I recommend this product if you have pain I would like to say that this is the best of two evilsbecause it burns at the start when you first start to use it It is really important to read the instructions to use it properly But nice to relocate the pain a little For my part the product works very wellHowever if you do not have major pain the product will be worse for youAnyway a great product to measure your pain level
4300,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,42994,0,If I could post a picture of what this cream did to me Picture the worst burning EVER It took several wipes and a shower to get it off my back and it still had bad pain from middle to the tailbone area which was red I was in SO much pain from this medicine it felt like my skin was on fire I tried putting lidocaine spray on it and the the spray just melted onto my skin
4301,Capsaicin,Pain,1,42952,1,Horrible It left me with burns I was up all thro the night trying to get this off of my knees it gave me extreme burning sensations DO NOT RECOMMEND
4303,Capsaicin,Pain,8,42876,2,I was suffering due to sciatic nerve compression not sure it is because of lumbar hernia or piriformis muscle spasm the doc did not mention for long time I used capsaicin patch on my lower back applied only for hours I felt much better the next day
4305,Capsaicin,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1,42867,3,I have peripheral neuropathy in my feet I had the feeling of socks crunched up I used this stuff and I added severe burning I used it days and returned it DONT BUY I now have burning feet It will go away but what kind of cure is burning feet not less pain Also if you get on hands it can cause problems so make sure you wash it off This OTC cream should say SEVERE BURNING FEELING POSSIBLE I never have pain at night when I sleep Last night I had burning feelingTHIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE BANNED
4306,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,1,42851,5,Well have had this treatment about years ago now I was told it was a very new treatment and only one use of it would provide permanent benefits and that it often gave back sensation to extremities in Peripheral Neuropathy for me this was not the case it was in a sheet format a speciased Nurse was doing the treatment cutting into this single sheet by aseptic technique and extra gloves the stinging that it cases to both my hands as in fingers and everywhere the Quitenza touched spent the next days virtually in the bath as skin was burning in PAIN now Pain I can feel unlike even touch seems out of reach apparently it takes up to months to work oh yeh and it is made from Capsicum Chillies
4307,Capsaicin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,1,42837,0,Tried it once hours later still burning unbearably
4309,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,42782,4,Im not sure it helped at all but when I woke up in the middle of the night sweating the burning sensation it caused was intense Very painful An ice pack helped but Im afraid to use again after this
4311,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,8,42707,12,This works for nerve pain but is waaay stronger than Bengay Tiger Balm amp the sort Honestly this should have a more serious alert on the bottle My dr had me start nerve desenitizingi think its called I have two types of nerve pain amp the pain can get real ugly I used a brush on my hamstrings and adductors to quotdensitizequot I was still just going crazy in pain meditatedwell tried Prayed amp am now suffering the consequences of putting Capzasin HP on my Scrubbed legsmaybe min past the scrubbing Honestly this pain rivals my nerve painawful close anyway Good product but BE careful wkids pets older folks amp especially people in crazy pain undertreated by a propaganda driven war on pain medicine amp the Pain Drs
4312,Capsaicin,Pain,1,42630,14,I used this for the first time last night and within one minute my skin felt like I had lit it on fire I followed the directions on the box to remove it but I suffered for hours My skin looked like I had sun poisoning I almost made a trip to the ER Today my skin is still very tender I made a bad situation much worse Never ever AGAIN
4314,Capsaicin,Pain,9,42594,15,I CAN WALK AGAIN I had so much pain in my right knee and nothing worked Cant take alleve I tried this and put on WAY TOO MUCH the first time Burned liked I was on fire After I use in very mall doses all I can say is IT WORKS Took pain away and I can traverse the stairs and walk with almost NO pain I like this better than taking pain meds I HIGHLY recommend this
4315,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,9,42594,15,I have been suffering from sciatica for about years now It has gradually gotten worse Ibuprofen acetaminophen and naproxin no longer help to relieve the pain in my left thigh I have found that a generic capsaicin patch placed on my lower back relives the pain It doesnt fully disappear but it becomes a lot more bearable
4319,Capsaicin,Pain,10,42563,8,Suffering for over months with Sciatic Nerve and Hamstring pain using Advil mg per hours which just wasnt completely relieving the pain A bottle of Absorbine not Jr produced in was in the medicine cabinet and contains capsaicin along with herbals and other ingredients After application the pain almost immediately was reduced from to about still taking Advil But about the th application of the Absorbine described above noticed pain subsided for a longer period Now we are unable to locate Absorbine with like ingredients Found a creme called Capzicin and it seems to being working satisfactorily times a day along with the mg Advil taken every hrs
4321,Capsaicin,Pain,8,42551,11,I just found out about Capzasin today and tried it for the first time for my fibromyalgia I have OTC and while I have only been using it a few hours I am so excited to have found it The burning sensation is mild compared to my pain and doesnt bother me in the least I tried it on one thigh to start and make sure it didnt bother me too much I had so much relief in the one leg I couldnt wait to use it on the other My only complaint is the smell It has a strong scent of menthol I am in most pain at night when trying to sleep so I think I will use it then I did read that showering can be uncomfortable but also that a milk compress helps
4322,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,10,42514,30,Capsaicin cream works amazingly well for my sciatica I apply on the side of my leg foot lower back or wherever I have painSo the version is too strong You should buy the version at Look for Rugby Capsaicin There is also a product called Zostrix which you can find with Also use plastic gloves to apply You are applying essence of hot peppers to your skin and if you transfer it to your eyes it will really burn It stays on your skin so after hours I scrub the area down with a soapy washcloth It reheats if you sweat or take a bath Without scrubbing it will reactivate if your skin gets wet
4323,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,42465,27,Probably best to do a small patch test before you use this product Also different Capsaicin preparations are more potent than others I have bursitus in my shoulder and it is very painful particularly when I sleep wrong on my shoulder Capsaicin is the only relief I get Now able to sleep through the night yes it burns thats the point it exhausts the pain receptors in the area Best product but you have to expect to burn thats what it does thats how it works
4326,Capsaicin,Pain,10,42443,14,I have bad sciatica Lying in bed was the worst and ive tried every thing Found this amazing capsisin and havent looked back At first i was putting on a fair bit and the burning was unbearable but found that sweating interacts so now i put a tiny bit on and now i have movement
4327,Capsaicin,Pain,9,42434,9,Yes it burns even worse after putting it on at night then waking up and taking a shower in the morning The water hitting it OH MY I used capsaicin patches for nerve damage pain in my rib after a car accident It worked the more you use it the more effective it was I am now using it on my neck cream my PCP told me it is one of those medications that the more you use it the more benefit you will getand the less the burn I am hoping the cream works as well on my neck as the patches did for my rib
4328,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,1,42423,11,Used it last night for knee pain and it started burning so bad it felt like my skin was melting off I would rather deal with the knee pain than ever use this stuff again
4331,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,8,42226,19,When I lay in bed with osteoarthritis pain and nerve painthis tends to give a warming sensation to a bit burning which takes my mind off the nerve pain and after a bit and with my pain meds I can fall asleep If you like hot showers in the morning it may warm up a bit while in the hot shower I wont live without it I only use it at bed time and when the pain is to great to fall asleep
4333,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,8,42091,26,Works best after a few doses
4334,Capsaicin,Not Listed / Othe,9,41937,22,It does produce a burning sensation the first two weeks After that it is a gentle warming sensation and really eases the pain in my back injury It is absolutely worth putting up with the initial burning sensation
4335,Capsaicin,Peripheral Neuropathy,9,41916,73,After a spinal injury I began to experience numbness pain and quotpricklyquot feelings in my legs and feet My toes and bottoms of my feet near the toes were and still are completely numb and I have frequent pain and burning in those areas I bought the Capsaicin cream without a prescription at Walmart for I applied it liberally to both feet and massaged the areas well I then put on white ankle socks so I could walk on my wood floors without leaving residue I did not experience any bad side effectsno burning etc The relief from my nerve pain subsided very quickly After about minutes I removed the socks and elevated my legs The medication definitely provided great relief DO wash your hands thoroughly with soap
4336,Capsaicin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,9,41902,29,I am a Dutchman living in The Hague My Post herpetic neuralgia dates from about months ago My physician prescribed kinds of tablets tramadol carbamazepine and paracetamol which gave relief to some extent Thereupon I searched quotPHNquot on internet and found capsaicin and on this website I asked for an additional prescription of capsaicin which I now apply times a day I feel back to normal and I too can say Got my life back
4337,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,10,41892,39,I applied two doses the first day I got it to my thumbs about eight hours apart Yes its true that its easy to get in your eyes nose or mouth and it burns Even after a shower I could still feel it on my skin I expected to have to reapply it each day But heres the funny part The pain in my hands is nowhere near as intense as it was even two days after that initial application Why Its welcomed but kinda weird
4338,Capsaicin,Pain,6,41791,39,Worked well the first time If you have severe burning like I had my second time milk applied provides instant relief
4340,Capsaicin,Pain,1,41584,43,I used this for knee pain per my doctor recommendation I read the instructions and applied the medication It didnt relieve my pain it caused more pain Severe burning stinging pain Even showering to wash the medication off was painful I had to use calamine lotion to counter the effects Perhaps my skin is more sensitive than others out there but I would use caution with this medication
4341,Capsaicin,Pain,9,41548,29,I began using CapsaicinHP for severe pain from by neck to top of my buttocks caused by fibromyalgia I found it to decrease my pain as much or better than nonnarcotic oral medications Then I had an injury to my back which required a lumbar spinal fusion at LS Capsaicin again helped my pain incredibly I applied everyday to times a day before surgery and then limited used to areas of neck and back away from incision until site healed then resumed use over entire back It does get very quothotquot at times but I learned not to focus on that and realized that was the time it seemed to be removing pain the best I am a nurse and eventually learned to allow it to quotheatquot which typically lasts about min and I got the best results
4344,Capsaicin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,8,41012,44,I have had PHN for years and have been in extreme pain My Internist told me about Zostrix HP along with the warning to be careful applying it and to wash it off my hands I started using latex gloves to administer it on my body and after weeks my pain began to subside I am now at a very manageable pain level On a with being the highest pain I am now finally at point five after years of being at a pain level of day and night I use it sparingly pea sized amount x a day I highly recommend it if you had shingles and then PHN
4346,Capsaicin,Pain,9,40887,19,I used Trixaicin HP for Thoracic Spine Damage to the nerve root at the C C level C root causing numbness in my index finger and thumb I used gloves and put the Trixaicin directly on the pain That caused the Trixaicin to heat up so much it burned Not unbearably but it did cause me to wonder if it heated up worse on the pain because that was the most painful spot
4347,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,40855,40,Im a year old female with moderate severe osteoarthritis of the hip and back I have been using Capsaicin gel for weeks and the pain has subsided tremendously Experienced burning sensation the first day only It has given me back parts of my reason for living
4348,Capsaicin,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1,40784,9,Side effects include allergic reaction rash hives itching pain in the middle of the chest tightness in the chest difficulty breathing or swallowing irritation redness blistering severepersistent burning at the application site
4349,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,9,40383,53,Im female and have had arthritis in my hands knees and feet over the past ten years Since using capsaicin over the last two years Ive found tremendous relief It burned when I first started using it but the burning quotwore offquot after a week and I find it totally painless to use I apply it in the morning as well as in the evening I learned to NOT use my fingers to apply it Instead I use the topside of my thumbs between the first and second joints from the tip of the thumb That way I dont accidentally get capsaicin in my eyes especially when applying my contact lenses an hour later I highly recommend capsaicin and suggest sticking with it even if at first it burns Its well worth trying
4350,Capsaicin,Osteoarthritis,6,40378,42,I prefer the initial pain of application than the pain in my spine hip and legs Be careful going out in the sun even the day after application some residual effects will be felt Wear latex or plastic gloves when applying and wash your hands after applying If you touch a part of your body that has capzasin on it be sure to rewash your hands and DO NOT touch your eyes without washing your hands
4351,Capsaicin,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1,40220,35,Tried it for foot pain diabetic neuropathy terrible results Pain increased had to wash it off Wash your hands very well after use even if you dont see the cream on your hands some residue may still exist and if you get it in your eyes it will really burn

4359,Gefitinib,Non-Small Cell Lung Cance,9,39964,90,My personal experience with Iressa has been very good The side effects of the drug were so much less than those of intravenous chemotherapy When I finished traditional chemotherapy in December I participated in the clinical trials I started taking Iressa in January My last scan after traditional chemotherapy showed that the cancer was still growing My next scan after taking Iressa for days showed marked improvement in my condition Each scan thereafter showed slow but detectable improvement It is now late May of and Im still taking Iressa and still showing signs of improvement The side effects while everpresent are far more tolerable than those of traditional chemotherapy

4387,Belviq,Obesity,5,42874,8,I will be starting belviq Sunday due to some of the comments saying make sure to start and stop when nothing is going on I have a big event Saturday but I am posting because of the price I went online printed the coupon filled out all the info etc before using the coupon it was out of pocket even with my insurance paying their part With the coupon at CVS and Cigna HMO I paid for mine So just FYI on the price Looking forward to this Phentermine worked the st year I took it and now it does nothing but spike my BP so Im hopeful this will help as I change my diet and exercise
4389,Belviq,Weight Loss,1,42868,8,Been on it for several days and cant take it no more Horribly nauseous the scariest night terrors ever and head hurts so bad I thought I would pass out I really thought I could get through it and it would work I just cant take it So sad
4390,Belviq,Obesity,2,42867,5,Well I wrote my review see below too soon I had only taken it that day and did not go through a full hour period This medicine is hell I had horrible nightmares like Ive never had in my life then the headache came back like someone hit me with a x I was a COMPLETE ZOMBIE the next day The worse No Belviq you are doing it wrong
4391,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42867,38,Im years old exercise regularly and have not been able to loose any weight at all on my own in years and actually started gaining My Dr Prescribed Belviq Ive been on Belviq for days Ive lost pounds Amazing I have had no side effects whatsoever except that the first night I had terrible dreams so now I only take this drug once a day in the morning and its working I need to loose pounds and I weighed under when I started I walk miles times a week and I went to an calorie diet every day I am very strict on my calories Lots of fruit protein and veggies which I hate but the weight is coming off and Im very encouraged I will continue till Im at my goal weight
4392,Belviq,Weight Loss,10,42867,25,I started taking belviq May My beginning weight was as of today beginning week two I weigh I have lost pounds I am on a calories a day I replaced a meal with a protein shake So for every thing is wonderful My first days on this medicine I was very tired and lower back pain All of those side affect has gone away I walk minutes every day I will be up dating weekly Good Luck everybody
4393,Belviq,Obesity,9,42865,3,First let me tell you if you go on belviqcom site and print coupon make sure you do all the steps You have to just call into an electronic response system not a live person For me that made a difference because I didnt want to talk to someone else about my weight Anyway Ill be honest Ive had this medicine for two months and today is the first day Ive taken any Ive taken weight loss medicine before years back of course not this kind and it changed me in a bad way So I finally tried this today and only had a very mild headache earlier and now its gone Its helped my appetite so far Im so glad I just wish I would not have waited these past two months to try it
4394,Belviq,Obesity,1,42865,4,I have been using Belviq for about two years I went from down to and then it just stopped helping me lose The price is so very high and even though I use a coupon and go to Walmart each month was a hassle with the pharmacist as to what discount if any I would be able to get I never heard of per month with a voucher I need to know where to get a voucher like THAT The last time I tried to use a company coupon Walmart told me that it was no longer valid Ive never gone back even thou I have a prescription While I was on it I noticed that my weight was no longer dropping even tho I was eating the same Without a coupon I wont be buying it any morebut where can I get a voucher and pay
4395,Belviq,Weight Loss,8,42864,19,I started taking Belviq about weeks ago after my doctor recommended I lose weight I have to admit the first week I was starving while taking Belviq I also started the paleo diet and increased my water to oz a day most dayslol and min of activity days a week I lost lbs the first week I have continued to lose weight due to the combination of the low carb and the Belviq I do not feel it is suppressing my appetite but I believe it is assisting in my weight loss I seem to be burning more calories and I rarely have cravings I do have a one carb treat once a week to treat myself and then I get right back on track sometimes a girl wants chocolate or cheesecake or BOTH I am pleased with the results so far I feel better
